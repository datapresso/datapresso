Officers discovered nearly 31 pounds of cocaine concealed in a compartment within the firewall.&#10;&#10;Lopez was arrested and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâ€™s Homeland Security Investigations. The drugs and vehicle were seized.&#10;&#10;Individuals arrested may be charged by complaint, the method by which a person is charged with criminal activity, which raises no inference of guilt. An individual is presumed innocent unless and until competent evidence is presented to a jury that establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&#10;&#10;CBP's Office of Field Operations is the primary organization within Homeland Security tasked with an anti-terrorism mission at our nationâ€™s ports.&#10;"/>

A CBP canine alerted to the presence of drugs worth an estimated $295,000.&#10;&#10;Another significant meth seizure occurred when officers at the Dennis DeConcini Port referred Martin Elenes Mercado, 18, of Nogales, Ariz., for a secondary inspection of his Dodge sedan. After a CBP narcotics detection canine alerted to the presence of drugs in his vehicle, officers removed nearly 13 pounds of methamphetamine, worth almost $201,000, from the firewall and dashboard areas.&#10;&#10;Six seizures involved marijuana; the largest of which occurred Saturday at the Mariposa Port when officers found 123 pounds of marijuana in a Ford van driven by Carlos Soto Rosas, 33, of Obregon, Sonora, Mexico. A CBP narcotics detection canine alerted officers to 40 packages of marijuana, worth an estimated $62,000, in the vanâ€™s headliner.&#10;&#10;In each incident, the vehicles and drugs were seized. The suspects were arrested and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcementâ€™s Homeland Security Investigations.&#10;&#10;Individuals arrested may be charged by complaint, the method by which a person is charged with criminal activity, which raises no inference of guilt. An individual is presumed innocent unless and until competent evidence is presented to a jury that establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&#10;"/>

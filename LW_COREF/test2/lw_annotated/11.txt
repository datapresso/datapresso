CBP officers found a dozen wrapped packages of drugs inside a custom-built compartment near the center console during a search.&#10;&#10;The drugs weighed a total of 63 pounds with a street value of approximately $783,000.&#10;&#10;The driver, a 49-year-old male U.S. citizen, was arrested and turned over to the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for further investigation.  &#10;&#10;The man was later brought to the Imperial County jail to await arraignment and CBP seized both the car and narcotics. &#10;&#10;â€” Chelcey Adami, cadami@ivpressonline.com&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Juvenile stabs teenager&#10;&#10;A 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of stabbing a teenage girl, battery and making criminal threats Monday morning near the 600 block of Olive Avenue, an El Centro police commander said. &#10;&#10;The victim came to the station around 7 a.m. and alleged the boy battered her and then assaulted her with a knife, leaving a stab wound to the leg, said Cmdr. Jeff Mason. The girl was transported to El Centro Regional Medical Center, according to the logs.&#10;&#10;The incident happened around 3 a.m. at the suspectâ€™s house, said Mason, who added patrol officers saw the suspect around 10:30 a.m. near his house on Olive Avenue and arrested him. Following the investigation, the suspect was taken to juvenile hall.&#10;&#10;There were no witnesses and both teenagers gave conflicting information, said Mason. &#10;&#10;â€œWe donâ€™t have a clear picture as to the why part of it,â€� he said.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Man picks fight at jujitsu academy&#10;&#10;A male angered over his ex-girlfriend dating someone else looked for the new boyfriend, a student at a jujitsu academy, to reportedly pick a fight Monday night, according to El Centro police logs. &#10;&#10;The incident took place near the jujitsu academy located in the 600 block of Main Street here, said Mason, who added no crime was committed, â€œthankfully.â€�&#10;&#10;But the male almost became physical toward the jujitsu student, according to the logs, and several students from the academy stepped out to assist their classmate. &#10;&#10;The jujitsu instructor then challenged the male to fight his student inside the class with gloves, the logs read. &#10;&#10;But the jilted boyfriend declined to go inside and left before police arrived, said Mason, who noted that a jujitsu academy isnâ€™t the best place to start trouble.&#10;"/>

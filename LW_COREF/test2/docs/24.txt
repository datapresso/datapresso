When Tyrese Little, 35, told inquiring police who approached him Sunday morning that he had "just a little weed," which turned out to be a gross underestimation, police said.

Little, approached at 2:30 a.m. by officers Michael Styles and Carlos Conceicao near the Van Dome Nightclub, aroused suspicion when he closed a car door and looked as if he was tucking something into his pants, police said.

The smell of marijuana emanating from where Little stood didnâ€™t help his case.

He was arrested for possessing over 50 grams of crack cocaine packaged in 14 bags for sale, a sandwich bag of marijuana and a loaded "Raven Arms" MP-25 handgun.

Also confiscated from Little were two cell phones and several bundles of cash totaling $11,767. Little faces two weapons and five drug charges.

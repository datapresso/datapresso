The Coast Guard suspended its search Sunday night for the Lynn kayaker who went missing Saturday evening in Swampscott.

“The entire Unified Command is deeply sympathetic to the family and friends of Mr. Lisovich,” said Commander Sean Carroll, Sector Boston Chief of Response, in a statement sent out by the Coast Guard. “We are sympathetic to his loved ones.”

Maryan Lisovich, 23, left Fisherman’s Beach to go fishing at about 4 p.m. Saturday. His girlfriend reported him missing at about 7 p.m. He was not wearing a lifejacket, according to the Coast Guard.

Lisovich’s kayak was found on land close to Fisherman’s Beach at about 8:40 p.m., according to Coast Guard spokesman Adam Stanton.

Rescue crews searched a 422-square-nautical-mile area for more than 24 hours, according to the Coast Guard’s statement, but suspended the search at 7:40 p.m. Sunday.

The Coast Guard sent a Station Point Allerton 47-foot Motor Life Boat and an Air Station Cape Cod MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter to search for Lisovich.

Swampscott Police, state police, state environmental police, the Massachusetts Marine Unit, and the Marblehead Harbormaster assisted the Coast Guard with the search.

A spokesman for the Swampscott Police said that the search may resume on Monday.

However, most relationships do not end with a bomb hoax being called in. Unfortunately, that is just what happened on an US Airways flight. The bomb hoax was first thought to be the work of a man on the flight. In the end, it was learnt that it was called in by a manâ€™s twenty-something year old ex-girlfriend. This resulted in delays for all the passengers on the plane.&#10;&#10;At first, the airline accused 29-year-old Christopher Shell of posing a threat to passengers and cabin crew. However, this rumor was fake. Apparently, a caller had said that Shell was dangerous. They said that he was carrying a liquid explosive with him.&#10;&#10;Shell was simply trying to travel from Philadelphia to his hometown of Forth Worth, Texas. He was traveling back home to celebrate his 29th birthday. When the bomb threat was called in, SWAT, local police, and even FBI agents were called in.&#10;&#10;After the passengers were removed from the plane, investigators found out that the bomb threat was a hoax. They went on to say that this threat was nothing more than a very nasty trick that was played on Shell. Now, the ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend may face federal charges. After all, these kinds of problems are not things that authorities take lightly. Currently, the FBI has not said if they are going to stick the ex-girlfriend with any kind of charges. However, at this point in time, it is looking very likely.&#10;"/>

AER Lingus has launched an investigation into a turbulence-related incident during a flight that left four crew members in hospital, including one with a broken ankle.

A scheduled service from Milan to Dublin was 15 minutes from landing when the incident occurred.

There were 62 passengers and six crew on board the flight on Friday night.

Flight EI-437 was approaching Dublin Airport when turbulence hit.

The flight's four cabin crew members had been in the rear galley of the aircraft, preparing for landing, when they were taken by surprise and tossed around.

No passengers were injured in the incident, as they were all seated in preparation for landing.

One female staff member was thrown to the floor and suffered a severe ankle fracture, while three of her cabin crew colleagues were also slightly injured.

The flight landed safely.

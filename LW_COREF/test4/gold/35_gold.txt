SEPTEMBER 7--Alarmed by Facebook posts promoting a â€œKilling Spreeâ€ this month in Littleton, Colorado--home to Columbine High School--FBI agents last week raided a residence allegedly connected to the online threats and seized several guns and â€œeight books and notebook involving killing,â€ court records show.

Law enforcement officials learned of the Facebook posts after a tipster contacted police in Littleton to report a variety of disturbing images and messages on a Facebook page in the name â<PERSON>€œEric Rebdomine</PERSON>.â€ One of the Columbine killers, <PERSON>Eric Harris</PERSON>, used the online alias â€œRebdomine.â€

Investigators discovered that the <PERSON>â€œRebdomineâ€</PERSON> account had created a Facebook â€œeventâ€ announcing the planned â€œKilling Spreeâ€ in Littleton. â€œJoin me on September 14th and kill as many people as possible,â€ the notice stated.

The tipster told cops that when she initially visited the page, she saw that â€œ180 people had been invited to the â€˜KILLING SPREE,â€™ and 37 had responded that they were coming,â€ according to an FBI affidavit sworn by Agent <PERSON>Russell Humphrey</PERSON>.

September 14 is â€œa significant day in the history of mass killings,â€ reported <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON>. On that date in 2006, two Wisconsin students â€œallegedly obsessedâ€ with the Columbine murders were arrested â€œwith an arsenal of weapons in connection with a planned attackâ€ on a Green Bay high school. <PERSON>Humphrey</PERSON> also noted that a Japanese man who killed eight elementary school students (and injured 13 others) was executed on that date in 2004.

A law enforcement review of the <PERSON>â€œRebdomineâ€</PERSON> account revealed a variety of other threatening statements, including, <PERSON>â€œIâ€™m</PERSON> going to show the world what a mass murderer really is. 85 people dead. 160 injured. <PERSON>Iâ€™ll</PERSON> get it done!â€ Following the July 20 Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting, <PERSON>â€œRebdomineâ€</PERSON> criticized the accused shooterâ€™s performance. <PERSON>â€œJames</PERSON> holmes had 6000 rounds of ammo, but only killed 12â€¦I could have done sooo much better.â€

As part of its probe of â€œpotential online death threats,â€ FBI agents served Facebook with a search warrant for IP addresses associated with the <PERSON>â€œRebdomineâ€</PERSON> account. Then, with the assistance of an Internet service provider, investigators tracked log-ins to the account to a Beaufort, South Carolina home. Other log-ins were made from an iPhone that â€œconnected to the Internet from various cell phone towers that were not in Beaufort.â€

Agents last Tuesday raided the White Pine Road residence, which is occupied by <PERSON>Mark Jordan</PERSON>, 57, and several relatives. They seized two Acer computers, an iPhone, two rifles, a revolver, and â€œeight books and notebook involving killing.â€

In a TSG interview, <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> said, â€œit was my daughterâ€ when asked who in his household was connected to the <PERSON>â€œRebdomineâ€</PERSON> account. <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> said that FBI agents interviewed <PERSON>his</PERSON> daughter, who <PERSON>he</PERSON> described as being in <PERSON>her</PERSON> 30s and â€œinterested in crime in general.â€ He added that <PERSON>he</PERSON> was not familiar with details of the federal probe.

No arrests have been made in connection with the FBIâ€™s â<PERSON>€œRebdomineâ€</PERSON> probe, which is centering on alleged threats transmitted in interstate commerce, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. (5 pages)

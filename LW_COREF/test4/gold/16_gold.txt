PRESIDIO — U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers working at the Presidio port of entry seized 629 pounds of marijuana Wednesday, Aug. 15.
It was the most significant enforcement event for El Paso area CBP officers during a day in which they seized an additional 417 pounds of marijuana and 42 pounds of cocaine in five seizures, more than $85,000 in unreported currency in two cases, and made two NCIC fugitive arrests including a man wanted in connection with the deaths of two people in New Mexico.
“Every day hard working CBP officers are having a positive impact on our community and our nation by stopping illegal activity at our borders,” said <PERSON>David Higgerson</PERSON>, acting Director of Field Operations for CBP in El Paso. “Many people do not realize how many violators they encounter on a daily basis while performing their import border security mission.”
The largest seizure of the day occurred late Wednesday afternoon at the Presidio port of entry.
A truck pulling a gooseneck trailer entered the facility from Mexico. CBP officers initiated an inspection and detected anomalies in the appearance of the trailer. They continued their exam and located narrow bundles of marijuana concealed in the hollow metal framing of the trailer.
CBP officers removed 85 marijuana-filled bundles from the trailer. No arrests were made and the investigation continues.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers’ primary mission is anti-terrorism; they screen all people, vehicles, and goods entering the United States, while facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel into and out of the United States.
Their mission also includes carrying out traditional border-related responsibilities, including narcotics interdiction, enforcing immigration law, protecting the nation’s food supply and agriculture industry from pests and diseases, and enforcing trade laws.

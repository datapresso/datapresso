Puddle of Mudd singer Wes Scantlin was arrested Tuesday in an Austin airport for allegedly being drunkenly combative with a flight attendant while in the air, a rep for the Austin Police Department told TMZ.
You might drink too if you were the singer of Puddle of Mudd.
According to police, Scantlin got into an argument with a flight attendant over alcohol. A source with airport security said Scantlin was upset because the flight crew wouldn't sell him booze.
Maybe they'll now change the band's name to the more sensible Puddle of Booze.
Scantlin's flight was originally bound for L.A. but was re-routed to Bergstrom International Airport, where Scantlin was booted from the plane.
Police told TMZ Scantlin was arrested and booked on suspicion of public intoxication, but he could also later face federal charges of interfering with a flight crew. Because it's always a good idea to cause a ruckus on an airplane.
Scantlin pleaded guilty to felony cocaine possession in July, but the judge agreed to clear his record in 18 months so long as Scantlin obeys all laws, a condition Scantlin may just have violated. He could face prison time for the cocaine charge, as well as for public intoxication and interfering with a flight crew.
BILLIE JOE ARMSTRONG OUT OF HOSPITAL: Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong is out of the hospital after canceling a show in Italy on Sunday night due to illness.
According to MSN.com, the East Bay native was admitted to the Hospital Maggiore in Bologna due to a mystery illness, and the band was forced to miss playing the I-Festival in the same city Sunday. No official details about his condition have been released, but local reports suggest Armstrong was suffering gastric problems and discharged himself from the hospital Monday.
TMZ caught up with Armstrong at the Los Angeles airport Tuesday, where he indicated he had a throat problem.
Italian publication La Voce also reports some fans caused problems at the hospital by attempting to visit Armstrong.
The singer's bandmates, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool, released a video statement to apologize to fans.
"We apologize profusely," Dirnt said. "Billy got rushed to the hospital last night due to illness. The doctors don't think it's a good idea for him to play today."
"We're beyond devastated," Cool added. "We're as sad as you guys are. Billie's extremely upset about it, and we'll see you soon."
HOLLYWOOD MOURNS MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN: Hollywood is mourning the death of Michael Clarke Duncan, The 54-year-old actor Monday in a Los Angeles hospital, having never fully recovered from a heart attack he suffered in July.
The 6-foot-5-inch, 325-pound actor "suffered a myocardial infarction on July 13 and never fully recovered," his rep confirmed to the New York Daily News.
His fianc√©e, Omarosa Manigault, told Radar Online, "I am devastated."
The reality TV star and Baptist minister had saved Duncan's life by performing CPR when she found him unresponsive the morning he entered the hospital seven weeks ago, a source told The News.
"He was the love of my life," Manigault told the gossip site.
"I am terribly saddened at the loss of Big Mike," Tom Hanks, who co-starred with Duncan in 1999's "The Green Mile," said in a statement. "He was the treasure we all discovered on the set of The Green Mile. He was magic. He was a big love of man and his passing leaves us stunned."
Those who knew Duncan said he was a lot like the gentle giant he sometimes played on the big screen.
Frank Darabont, who directed Duncan in his breakout Oscar-nominated role in "The Green Mile," called him "one of the finest people I've ever had the privilege to work with or know.
"Michael was the gentlest of souls -- an exemplar of decency, integrity and kindness," Darabont said in a statement. "The sadness I feel is inexpressible."
"I'll miss you, my brother," actor Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson, Duncan's co-star in 2002 flick "The Scorpion King," wrote on Twitter.
"The MOST gentle of Giants. RIP, my friend Michael," actor Tommy Davidson, who worked with Duncan on TV's "Proud Family."
Duncan, a former bodyguard for Will Smith and Jamie Foxx, also starred in "Sin City," "Daredevil" and "The Whole Nine Yards."
"Rest in Peace to my brother who paved the way for me and many Black actors, Michael Clarke Duncan," said "The Expendables 2" actor Terry Crews. "Honored to have known him and called him a friend to me and my family."
TOM CRUISE ALLEGEDLY AUDITIONED A POTENTIAL WIFE: Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology auditioned actress Nazanin Boniadi to be his wife before he married Katie Holmes, according to a story in the October issue of Vanity Fair.
Apparently she won by not winning.
The story, written by Maureen Orth, says a secret wife-auditioning process began in 2004, headed by Shelly Miscavige, wife of Scientology chief David Miscavige, with the purpose of finding a girlfriend for Cruise. Sources told Orth about the elaborate wife-auditioning process, in which actresses who were Scientologists were chosen and questioned.
A spokesman for Cruise denied the actor Boniadi to be his wife. In a statement to ABC News, the rep said: "Lies in a different font are still lies -- designed to sell magazines." The Church of Scientology told Vanity Fair that no such recruiting project occurred.
Oscar-winning director and former Scientologist Paul Haggis is backing the story. In an email to Showbiz411.com, Haggis said he has known Boniadi for three years.
"I met her through a mutual friend when I was doing my own personal research into the allegations against Scientology, before I wrote my letter of resignation," Haggis wrote. "Naz was embarrassed by her unwitting involvement in this incident and never wanted it to come out, so I kept silent. However I was deeply disturbed by how the highest ranking members of a church could so easily justify using one of their members; how they so callously punished her and then so effectively silenced her when it was done. It wasn't just the threats; they actually made her feel ashamed, when all she had been was human and trusting."
Sounds like a reality show.
Boniadi, an Iranian-born, London-raised actress, was eventually selected as the Chosen One. In a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend, according to the story.
They also made her watch the volleyball scene in "Top Gun" ten straight times.
She and Cruise dated from November 2004 to January 2005. Although she was allegedly in love with him, his intense affection and public displays of that affection were too much for her.
He also jumped on her couch. Twice.
After she reportedly disrespected a Scientology chief, she was asked to move out of Cruise's home and into Scientology's Celebrity Centre where she was later told she had been dumped.
Cruise began dating Katie Holmes in 2005. That same year, Holmes began studying Scientology. "I'm really excited about it," she told The Associated Press at the time. The two divorced in late-June.
The October issue of Vanity Fair hits newsstands September 6.
CHUCK NORRIS SAYS OBAMA RE-ELECTION DOOMS US ALL: Chuck Norris and his wife say in a new video that America is pretty much doomed to face the apocalypse if President Obama wins re-election in November.
Holding hands with wife Gena, Norris looks fairly depressed in his "dire warning to America." He says that our "country as we know it could be lost forever" if Obama is re-elected and that he can't "stand on the sidelines ... (as we) go the way of socialism or something much worse."
It's becoming clear that someone wasn't aware he was play acting in all those bad action movies.
Gena was even more severe, predicting "1,000 years of darkness" if Obama is re-elected.
Last time I checked, presidents only served four-year terms.

SANTA TERESA, N.M. (AP) â€” Federal authorities say they've seized more than 730 pounds of marijuana at New Mexico's Santa Teresa port.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers say the marijuana was concealed in five tractors being transported from Mexico.
A freightliner pulling a flatbed trailer loaded with the older-model tractors was selected for an extensive search by CBP officers working in the cargo lot.
A drug-sniffing dog alerted officers, who say 24 marijuana bundles were found hidden within the rear differential unit of each tractor.
They say 733 pounds of marijuana was seized.
No arrests were immediately made, but CBP officials say the case was still being investigated Monday.

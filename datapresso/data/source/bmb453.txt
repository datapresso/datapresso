Dressed in a bright orange prison jumpsuit, short sleeves and restrained by handcuffs, Tsarnaev spoke with a Russian accent as he repeatedly said "not guilty" into a microphone.  In the courtroom, the Russian immigrant and former college student looked much as he did in a photo widely circulated after his arrest, his hair curly and unkempt.  It was the first time he appeared in the court since he was found bloody and huddled in a dry-docked boat in the suburban community of Watertown in April following the bombing at Boston Marathon that killed three people and injured more than 260.  He didn't appear remorseful even as victims and their families offered little reaction to his court appearance.  Liz Norden, the mother of two men who lost their right legs in the bombings, said: "I actually felt sick to my stomach."  MIT Police Chief John DiFava, who was also in the courtroom, said Tsarnaev looked "smug."  "I didn't see a lot of remorse. I didn't see a lot of regret," he said. "It just seemed to me that if I was in that position, I would have been a lot more nervous, certainly scared.

Tsarnaev, 20, is in federal custody and has pleaded not guilty to numerous charges, including using a weapon of mass destruction. He faces a potential death sentence if convicted. He is accused of helping plant two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line of the marathon that killed three people and injured more than 260 others. Monday&rsquo;s action was a procedural step needed so that Tsarnaev will eventually appear in state court to face charges in connection with the flight and shootings that officials say were part of the aftermath of the bombings. Tsarnaev will likely not appear in state court until the federal case is resolved.  &ldquo;It is the intention of the Middlesex District Attorney that the defendant stand trial for these charges in Middlesex County,&rdquo; Dist. Atty. Marian T. Ryan&rsquo;s office said in a statement emailed to reporters.                                          Tsarnaev is accused of acting with his brother, Tamerlan , 26, to plant the bombs. After the explosions, the brothers were identified by authorities based on video evidence from the scene and a massive manhunt took place through the Boston metropolitan area.  On April 18, authorities said, the two shot and killed Officer Sean Collier in Cambridge, then fled again. Tamerlan was shot in a subsequent confrontation with police and run over by his fleeing brother. He was pronounced dead on April 19.  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured in a boat in the backyard of a Watertown home on the evening of April 19.  On June 27, he was indicted by a Middlesex grand jury on charges of murder, attempted armed robbery, armed assault with intent to murder (four counts), assault with a dangerous weapon (four counts), kidnapping, armed robbery, unlawful possession of a firearm, possession of a large capacity feeding device, and possession of a firearm with a defaced serial number.  Monday's default warrant was issued after a brief hearing in Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn. Tsarnaev was not present in court.  ALSO:  Minneapolis boy, 9, sneaks on flight to Las Vegas  Third motorcyclist in SUV driver bearing arrainged in New York  Capitol shooting: Seeking clues into odd behavior of Miriam Carey                                                                                                                                                           Copyright &copy; 2013, Los Angeles Times                                                                                            															 	 											 								 								 																		 								 									 								 							 																																		 							 								 									 										 Comments 									 									 2 								 							 						 																										 							 																											 						 						 						 						 						 																										 						 																	 																																																										 				 			 							                                                                                                       	 	 	                                                                                                     	    	 	 	 	  	     	 		 Comments (2) 		 Add / View comments | Discussion FAQ 	 		 														 							   	 					     	     	     	      Natalie L at 12:57 PM October 09, 2013										     Watch as the American justice system trips all over itself to protect a mass-murderer. If this isn't a confirmation of a judicial comedy show what is? Why not take him out and hang him on the Boston Common? It would redeem every fleeting iota of Courage we once had as a nation of real, swift justice, but now only wind-bagging cowards as we prepare another OJ trial. It's sickening.     															 							   	 					     	     	     	      justamaz Baxter at 9:18 AM October 09, 2013										     Anyone tired of seeing this punk looking so innocent?

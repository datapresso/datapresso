I think not able to communicate  yet," Deval Patrick, the Massachusetts governor said after attending a  tribute to the victims of Monday's bomb attacks that left three dead and  about 180 injured.   CBS television quoted investigators as saying that Tsarnaev suffered two  serious wounds and had lost a lot of blood. It said investigators had  speculated that one wound in the back of his neck could have been a suicide  attempt.   "They say it appears from the wound that he might have stuck a gun in his  mouth and fired," said the report, which added that Tsarnaev could  understand what those around him were saying.   Tsarnaev was detained on Friday. His elder brother Tamerlan was killed in a  shootout with police earlier in the day during a massive manhunt.  			 Related Articles 				 					 													 			 Bomber's wife learned he was wanted from TV 		 	 22 Apr 2013 													 												 													 			 Boston bomber: 'tragedies can happen anywhere - it's too bad' 		 	 22 Apr 2013 													 												 													 			 Boston bomber arrested: how David Henneberry found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in his garden 		 	 20 Apr 2013 													 												 													 			 Boston bombings: timeline of marathon attack and capture of bombers 		 	 20 Apr 2013 													 												 													 			 Lionel Shriver: we shall not yield to those who hate 		 	 21 Apr 2013 													 												 													 			 Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may never speak again 		 	 21 Apr 2013 													 												 		 	  Gov Patrick said he hopes the teenaged suspect survives. "We have a  million questions and those questions need to be answered," he added.   The American Civil Liberties Union and a federal public defender raised  concerns about investigators' plan to question Tsarnaev without reading him  his rights.   ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said a legal emergency exception  applies only when there is a continued threat to public safety and is "not  an open-ended exception" to the Miranda rule, which guarantees the  right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.   The FBI confirmed yesterday it had interviewed Tamerlan in 2011, at the  request of an unidentified foreign government &mdash; later reported to be Russia  &mdash; over suspected ties to an extremist group.   The questioning did not produce any &ldquo;derogatory&rdquo; information and the matter  was put &ldquo;to bed,&rdquo; a US law enforcement source said.   The FBI&rsquo;s contact with Tamerlan was described as &ldquo;a sit-down interview where  they asked him questions about contacts and surroundings&rdquo;.        They are also likely to have conducted a standard background check on him,  running his name through databases, checking on his communications and any  overseas travel.   The FBI said in a statement: &ldquo;The request stated that it was based on  information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer,  and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the  United States for travel to the country&rsquo;s region to join unspecified  underground groups.&rdquo;   The matter was not pursued further, however, because interviews with Tamerlan  and family members &ldquo;did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or  foreign&rdquo;.   Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security  Committee, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s new information to me and it&rsquo;s very disturbing that  he&rsquo;s on the FBI radar screen.&rdquo;  Zubeidat Tsarnaeva said: &ldquo;They [the FBI] used to come [to our] home, they used  to talk to me. They were telling me that he [Tamerlan] was really an  extremist leader and that they were afraid of him. They told me whatever  information he is getting, he gets from these extremist sites.     &ldquo;They were controlling him, they were controlling his every step and now they  say that this is a terrorist act. Never, ever is this true, my sons are  innocent.&rdquo; She added: &ldquo;I am 100 per cent sure that this is a set-up. It&rsquo;s  impossible for both of them to do those things. If there was anyone who  would know, it would be me.&rdquo;  Dzhokhar&rsquo;s capture triggered jubilant scenes across Boston and brought to an  end a five-day drama in which police imposed an unprecedented lockdown  across the city.   It also emerged on Saturday that Tamerlan&rsquo;s wife was a Muslim convert from a  middle-class Boston family.   Katherine Russell, 24, converted to Islam three years ago, after meeting  Tamerlan and giving birth to their daughter Zahara. She was described by  neighbours as an &ldquo;all-American girl&rdquo;. Dzhokhar, 19, was on Saturday night  being treated for &ldquo;serious but not life-threatening&rdquo; injuries at a hospital  in Boston. He suffered a severe loss of blood and was said to be too ill to  talk to police about the motive for the attack.   The US Justice Department said on Saturday that Dzhokhar would not initially  be read his rights, under a rare public safety exemption that allows  officials to interrogate him and submit his statement in court without prior  legal warning. An official said Dzhokhar could face a range of charges,  including the use of weapons of mass destruction for his part in the  detonation of a bomb. That charge carries a maximum penalty of death.   While Massachusetts has outlawed the death penalty, federal law allows it.   The brothers, ethnic Chechens who were apparently well integrated into US  society, are suspected of having set off two bombs in pressure cookers  packed with ball bearings and nails at the finish line of the Boston  Marathon, killing three people and injuring nearly 180 more.   Among those who died was eight-year-old Martin Richard, whose family welcomed  Dzhokhar&rsquo;s capture. In a statement they said: &ldquo;Tonight, our community is  once again safe from these two men.&rdquo;  However, further questions were raised when it was reported that Tamerlan left  the US in January 2012 to travel to Russia, returning in mid-July.   An official at the Department of Homeland Security said he was on the &ldquo;radar  screen&rdquo; of agents in Boston from when he returned to the US to the end of  autumn.   The suspects&rsquo; father, Anzor Tsarnaev, who lives in the Russian republic of  Dagestan, also said the FBI had been watching his family and visited the  brothers&rsquo; home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, five times, most recently 18  months ago, looking for Tamerlan. &ldquo;They said there were doing preventive  work. They were afraid there might be some explosions on the streets of  Boston,&rdquo; he said.   Tamerlan was allegedly one of a number of young Muslim men who were feared to  have become radicalised at one of the city&rsquo;s mosques.   National security and law enforcement authorities had said earlier that they  had not turned up any evidence that the Tsarnaev brothers had contacts with  al-Qaeda or other militants overseas.   On Saturday night, FBI agents led a woman wearing a hijab away from the  apartment where the brothers had lived in Boston. One television channel  said the woman was Tamerlan&rsquo;s wife, although a neighbour said it was another  relation.   Speaking after Dzhokhar&rsquo;s capture, President Obama said there were still many  unanswered questions. &ldquo;Among them, why did young men who grew up and studied  here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence?&rdquo; He  said the families of those killed deserve answers.     According to the Boston Globe, Dzhokhar attended a soccer party on Wednesday  at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, where other guests described  him as looking relaxed.   While Tamerlan had a Green Card but was not a US citizen, Dzhokhar became a  naturalised citizen during a ceremony on Sept 11 last year.   In announcing his arrest, Boston police posted a notice on Twitter at 1.30am  GMT on Friday, stating: &ldquo;Captured!!! The hunt is over.&rdquo;  A Syrian government-backed group was accused of hacking various US accounts to  send messages alleging that Barack Obama was covering up a government  conspiracy. Tweets coming from CBS News were suspended after the 60 Minutes  account claimed the US government was "hiding the real culprit of the  Boston bombing."       			 		  					 								 		  		 		 	  			 		 			 				 					 USA 				 								 			 			 					 									 News &#187; 								 								 									 World News &#187; 								 								 									 North America &#187; 								 								 									 Nick Allen &#187; 								 								 									 Philip Sherwell &#187; 								 								 				 		 	  	 		 		 Related Partners 		 		 			 								 The best way to transfer money overseas 			 		 	  	 			 In USA 			 			 				 		 									 		 	 			 Ninety years of Disney: in pictures 		 	 		 	 			 				 		 									 		 	 			 Mia Farrow's life 		 	 		 	 			 				 		 									 		 	 			 Frank Sinatra's wives and lovers in pictures 		 	 		 	 			 				 		 									 		 	 			 Obama 'hugely impressed' by Pope Francis 		 	 		 	 			 				 		 									 		 	 			 Silk Road website was Internet's 'most sophisticated criminal marketplace' 		 	 		 	 	 					 			 				  	 	  						 					 				 						 																 									 				 				 				 		 Advertisement 							 				 			 		 	  			 						 			 		 		 			 		   Advertisement  		   																			 								 							 More from the web &#187; 							 		 														 						 						 				 Advertisement  	 			   														 								 							 More from the web 						 		 														 						 						  		  				 News Most Viewed 			 		 		 				 					 						 							 TODAY 						 					 					 						 							 PAST WEEK 						 					 					 						 							 PAST MONTH 						 					 				 		 		 			 			 				 						 US debt ceiling crisis  Barack Obama has won the shutdown.

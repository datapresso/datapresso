(AP) — A Massachusetts court has issued an arrest warrant for state charges against the surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect.  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (joh-HAHR' tsahr-NEYE'-ehv) remains in custody after pleading not guilty to federal charges stemming from the April 15 explosions at the finish line that killed three people. 																		 Massachusetts prosecutors say they sought the new warrant to preserve their right to pursue murder and other state charges.  Tsarnaev was indicted in June on state charges including murder in the death of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer.  He was supposed to be arraigned Monday, but a prosecutor says U.S. marshals are unable to bring Tsarnaev to state court until his federal case concludes.  Tsarnaev's lawyer for the state charges was not in court and could not immediately be reached.

A massive probe was underway Tuesday after two bombs struck the Boston Marathon, killing at least three and wounding more than 100. Monday's blasts near the finishing line raised fears of a terrorist attack more than a decade after nearly 3,000 people were killed in suicide airliner strikes on New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. US President Barack Obama went on national television to warn against &quot;jumping to conclusions&quot; but a senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such an attack was &quot;clearly an act of terror.&quot; (Stan Honda / AFP / Getty Images) Boston Marathon Explosion In this image from video provided by WBZ TV, spectators and runners run from what was described as twin explosions that shook the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Monday, April 15, 2013, in Boston.

You are the despots to whom freedom of speech means as long as you agree with it. You are the despots who want to execute someone without a trial because you "know" he's guilty. You are the haters who would deny rights to minorities or anyone different from you.  You are pathetic, & if it were not so sad, you would be jokes. Actually you are that.			 						 																 							 						 																				 												 gagafan: What I find so pathetic about you right wing extremist, 						 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/gagafan/state-arrest-warrant-for-dzhokhar-tsarnaev_n_4057943_290738745.html 						 							 								History							 |						 																		 							Permalink						 												 |						 							Share it						 											 			 			 		 						 			 				 						 								 							 							 										 												 nlduvall 						 													 						 							 13 Fans 														       						 					 									 			 			 				 					10:13 PM on 10/07/2013				 																																Who says it's the right wingers who want him gone?			 						 																 							 						 																				 												 nlduvall: Who says it&#039;s the right wingers who want him gone? 						 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/nlduvall/state-arrest-warrant-for-dzhokhar-tsarnaev_n_4057943_290753485.html 						 							 								History							 |						 																		 							Permalink						 												 |						 							Share it						 											 			 			 		 						 				 				 			This comment has been down-ranked into oblivion.

Let me guess his defense will be he comes from a broken family,his dead brother hypnotized him therefore he's not responsible, he had trouble learning the English language so he fell behind in school and was not properly educated, he must have been bullied in school ( poor boy). He should when found guilty 5 years from now after appeals, have to walk point for our troops and locate land mines for them.

From BostonInno:   On April 15, 2013, bombings at the marathon finish line aimed to destroy that fabric, and a team at Northeastern University is now inviting individuals to strengthen it.  Our Marathon , a comprehensive, crowd-sourced digital archive of the Boston Marathon bombings&#8230;  [Clip]  Five graduate students were hired to help build the infrastructure, and the team started securing partnerships with others around the city, including  WCVB-TV Channel 5 , WBUR ,  GlobeLab  and the  Digital Public Library of America . Together, they&#8217;ve been able to collect 3,000 items, including content WCVB filmed during Marathon Monday that didn&#8217;t make it to air, well-wishes gifted to patients at Boston Medical Center and first-person accounts from victims of the bombings.

Ailina Tsarnaeva is expected to ask a South Boston judge Wednesday to remove a default warrant issued after she failed to appear in court on a 2011 charge of misleading police.  A Suffolk district attorney's office spokesman says the 23-year-old Tsarnaeva is accused of misleading a Boston police detective investigating the recovery of a counterfeit bill. He says she did not show up for a court date after her arraignment.  The spokesman says prosecutors will be requesting higher bail.  Her brother has pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from the April 15 explosions that killed three people and injured more than 260.  Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

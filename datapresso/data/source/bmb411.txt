Those two devices, when detonated, killed three spectators and injured nearly 200. Many of the victims were maimed. The other suspect is reported as brother Tamerlan, 26. The pair are ethnic Chechens who immigrated to the U.S. approximately a decade ago. Dzhokhar is a U.S. citizen.  In the pursuit leading to the termination of Tamerlan and the arrest of Dzhokhar, one MIT officer identified as Sean Collier, 26, was killed, and an MBTA agent was severely wounded. Dzhokhar was later located in a Watertown backyard, hiding in a boat. A firefight ensured and it appears that the surviving suspect eventually surrended.  HD photo:   The original photo was pulled from Reddit here .                       9:43 PM            Andrea Ayres-Deets                   Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Will the Death Penalty be Pursued?             Now that the 19-year-old second bombing suspect has been captured questions remain about how exactly he should be treated. The capture came after an intense 24-hour manhunt in the small town of Watertown, Mass. The Boston Police released the following Tweets following the intense standoff.    And this is the scene outside of a students dorm room in Boston:   As celebrations happen and people finally begin to return to some sense of normalcy, the obvious questions about the fate of the suspect will begin to surface. Currently, what we know is this. The suspect was taken alive, but he apparently received a gun shot would from the previous evening's gun fight. Recent reports have placed him en route to a hospital located in Cambridge, Mass. The suspect can be questioned without having been read his Miranda warning when the safety of the public is believed to be at risk. That, however, has not happened as the suspect is said to be in serious condition. During a press conference given by police officers, they said their first priority was to treat the suspect for his injuries.  The White House tweeted the takeaways from President Obama's press briefing which happened moments ago:   Earlier Friday, Senator Lindsey Graham called for the suspect to be treated as an enemy combatant on Twitter.    Speaking to the Washington Post he indicated that the "homeland was a battlefield." The Obama Administration is not likely to change the status of the 19-year-old recent U.S. citizen, as they have been unwilling to do so in the past with other terror suspects. The "underwear bomber" and Osama Bin Laden's son-in-law were both charged under civilian law.  Why would Graham wish to reclassify the status of the alleged Boston Marathon bomber? It would open up the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, but many question the reliability and ethical use of such techniques .  "The current administration has a firm and publicly stated policy against using military detention for domestic captures or U.S. citizens. So whatever the (National Defense Authorization Act) may theoretically authorize or tolerate, it doesn't affect this situation," wrote Benjamin Wittes, senior fellow and research director in public law at the Brookings Institution."  Following the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center Bombing's in the 1990s enacted several reforms to habeas corpus. These reforms were part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. The act limited the amount of petitions a prisoner had. Though the act was clearly out of a response to terrorism acts, it applies to both capital and non-capital cases .  "Procedurally, it bans successive petitions by the same person, requiring defendants to put all of their claims into one appeal. Substantively, it narrows the grounds on which successful habeas claims can be made, allowing claims only to succeed when the convictions were contrary to &ldquo;clearly established federal law&rdquo; or an &ldquo;unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence."  What crimes constitute the punishment of death penalty has been expanded in the past twenty years especially following the September 11 attacks. Some of these laws include the, Terrorist Bombings Convention Implementation Act ( 2002 ), and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act ( 2004 ). These acts expanded the use of the death penalty for crimes that were thought to be related to terrorist acts. Examples include :       18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 229 and 229A(a)(2)&ndash;knowingly developing, producing, acquiring, transferring directly or indirectly, receiving, stockpiling, retaining, owning, possessing, using, or threatening to use any chemical weapon; or knowingly assisting or inducing any person to do any of the above; or knowingly attempting or conspiring to do any of the above, where death results.    15 U.S.C. &sect; 1825(a)(2)(C)&ndash;killing of an official while engaged in or on account of performance of his or her official duties under 15 U.S.C. &sect; 1821 et seq., which deals with protection of horses in horse shows, exhibitions, sales, or auctions.    Whether or not this individual will be subject to the death penalty just is not known. It's far too early to tell. What we do know is this, the treatment of this suspect will come under intense scrutiny.                      27     Shares                    9:05 PM            Chris Miles                    Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Arrested: Boston Bomber In Police Custody                                 The second Boston bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is reportedly alive, in federal custody and is being attended by medics.  Boston police scanner chatter said &ldquo;suspect in custody.&rdquo;  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev found himself late on Friday in a fire fight in someone's backyard in Watertown, Mass. He was on a boat that was trailered there.  Authorities surrounded the boat and Tsarnaev gave up after an initial gun battle.  Based on traffic on the local police scanner, officers were preparing to converge on the boat, apparently ready to use flash grenades to stun Tsarnaev and take him alive.  A hostage negotiator was reportedly on scene, and the Boston Globe reports that he was overhead saying, "We know you're in there.

Reportedly, a neighbor noticed a trail of blood that helped tip off law enforcement. Tsarnaev tried to take refuge in a boat and when confronted by police, they exchanged gunfire, and he reportedly tried to set the boat on fire. Officers fired flash bangs. He is injured and will be taken to a local hospital. A crowd cheered on law enforcement after it was all over.                         8:56 PM            Jake Horowitz                    Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Arrested: Standoff is IN CUSTODY                                 After a long standoff, suspect #2 in the Boston Marathon bombing Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been arrested and taken into custody. The suspect is being transported by ambulance along with a police escort, and he has been escorted off the scene.  Police are now combing through the crime scene for evidence, and celebrating. The police are still on scene checking for more bombs.  While the 20-hour standoff is over, this is only the beginning. Because the suspect was taken alive, he'll be put in federal court and put on trial for his crime.  It remains unclear how wounded the suspect is, and his condition is unknown.                      14     Shares               8:46 PM            Jake Horowitz                    Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Captured: Standoff is Finally Over, Taken Into Custody                                 A hostage negotiator is reportedly on scene, and the Boston Globe reports that he was overhead saying, "We know you're in there.

The suspect has been placed into an ambulance, and he is being taken away. This is over, the long standoff appears to have come to a close, and the suspect has been taken alive.  Ambulance is headed off the scence with a police cruiser.                       8:45 PM            Michael Luciano                    Dzhokhar Tsarnaev CAUGHT: Marathon Bombing In Custody                                 Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a 19 year-old suspect in Monday&rsquo;s bombings at the Boston Marathon, has been caught in the backyard of a house in Watertown, Mass. Tsarnaev was in a boat in that backyard.  Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan were first identified as suspects on Thursday by the FBI, though authorities did not know their names. On late Thursday night, an MIT campus police officer, Sean Collier, was shot and killed by one or both of the brothers, who subsequently became involved in a shootout in the suburb of Watertown.  The owner of the boat noticed the tarp covering his boat was torn late Friday afternoon, and went to investigate. That is when he found a bleeding man inside, at which point he called the police. After his apprehension, Tsarnaev was rushed to the hospital with life threatening gunshot wounds to his neck and leg, which he sustained Thursday night during a shootout with police.  During the police engagement on Friday night, the Boston Globe spoke to neighborhood resident Lisa Bontempi, who told the newspaper ,  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of shooting. ... I&rsquo;m really scared. I&rsquo;ve got to go.&rdquo;  The Globe also talked to another Franklin Street resident:  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing every officer rushing to the corner. We&rsquo;ve heard gunshots. We&rsquo;ve got cops in bulletproof vests and an ambulance is there, with someone carrying out a stretcher,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Louise Harrison Lepera, another Franklin street resident.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of cops outside,&rdquo; said another resident, who declined to give her name. &ldquo;Oh, my God, they&rsquo;re just crouched down by the cars. But I heard a couple of pops, I&rsquo;m not sure what they were exactly.&rdquo;  Police used flash grenades on the boat in an effort to take Tsarnaev alive.                      46     Shares                  8:33 PM            Andrea Ayres-Deets                   Watertown Map: Where is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Hiding?

Review this live blog for the latest information. ]  The 117th Boston Marathon is today, with 27,000 runners expected to start the race. Today's temperatures are expected to be in the low to mid 50s, unlike last year when temps hit 80 degrees. Kenyans have dominated the marathon over the last two decades, especially on the men's side, where a Kenyan has won 19 out of the last 22 marathons. However, Ethiopian Gebre Gebremariam is a favorite. On the women's side, Kenyan Sharon Cherop will try to defend her title against a field that includes local hopeful Shalane Flanagan from Marblehead, Mass.                         99     Comments               |                68579     Views               |                101     Shares                                                         The Discussion        Log In to Respond                                  Joshua Kzin 8:38 PM     The next Biblical GOP &quot;Crusade&quot; looms...The two brothers were Islamic.

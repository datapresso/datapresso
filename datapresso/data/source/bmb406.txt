Baltimore Sun													 											 										 Story 										| Oct 10, 2013 																															| 11:57 AM 																			 											 												 												 													Erika Brannock has not been to an organized race since April, when the first of two homemade bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line so badly injured the 29-year-old Towson preschool teacher that doctors were forced to amputate her left leg above the knee. That will change Saturday, when Brannock -- who took her first steps with a prosthesis just last weekend -- serves as the official starter at the Baltimore Running Festival. The decision to participate was not a difficult one. "I immediately...

But don&rsquo;t dismiss its lack of curb appeal. Within its walls is a rich and vibrant stash of artifacts that, collectively, retell journalism&rsquo;s quirky, melodramatic backstory. The facility, just south of Route 1 and Whiskey Bottom Road, functions as the go-to arm of the Newseum, the glassy and gleaming edifice midway between the White House and the Capitol.

But that was it. Preparations for the Grand Prix were running several hours ahead of schedule the day before Friday's qualifying races. In the cavernous room &mdash; Mayer asked that its location not be divulged &mdash; police and others studied 15 big-screen televisions showing camera feeds and maps. "It's not like it was last year," he said. "That...

So the Dundalk resident was startled when stadium workers told her she could not enter carrying a baby bag stuffed with diapers, bottles and formula for her 7-month-old daughter. &ldquo;Oh well, that's just great!&rdquo; she thought sarcastically as she and her husband trudged back to their car with the bag. They transferred the baby items to...

This year, with 19 U.S. consulates and embassies closed and the State Department issuing vague warnings against travel anywhere in the world, al-Qaida suddenly seems resurgent &mdash; and as frightening as ever. So which is it: defeated or resurgent? Neither, really. Al-Qaida hasn't gone away, but it has changed &mdash; in a way that makes it less dangerous for Americans at home but...

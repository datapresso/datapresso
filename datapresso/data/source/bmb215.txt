At the Tsarnaev family home in the Russian province of Dagestan, Zubeidat Tsarnaev played part of a recording of the conversation from her smartphone to journalist Nick Sturdee for a report that aired on Britain&rsquo;s Channel 4 News .    Advertise | AdChoices       She also said her son was receiving financial support, and that somebody had opened a bank account in his name. Tsarnaev, 19, is in a federal prison hospital in Massachusetts and has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. Three people were killed and 264 injured when two bombs exploded near the Boston marathon finish line on April 15. He could face the death penalty. His older brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a firefight with police. Tsarnaev was injured in the firefight. In the phone call, Zubeidat asks her son if he is in pain. ''No of course not, I'm already eating and have been for a long time,&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;They are giving me rice and chicken now, everything's fine.'' She is heard sobbing on the call. He tries to reassure her, saying: ''Everything is good, please don't say anything.&rdquo; Zubeidat also told Channel 4 News that her son assured her he did not need any money from his family. She said: &ldquo;He said &lsquo;'Mama, do not worry about me. I do have money. Somebody opened an account for me and people send me money here and I do have lots of money.'&rdquo; She said she asked him how much money he had and he replied: &ldquo;Thousands [sic] dollars.&rdquo; Sturdee also interviewed Tsarnaev&rsquo;s father, Anzor, and asked him about the 12 years in which the Tsarnaev family lived together in Massachusetts. &ldquo;I loved the USA. I really did," Anzor told Sturdee . &ldquo;I loved the USA. Until it killed my son.&rdquo; Both parents insisted Tsarnaev did not discuss his guilt or innocence over the crime in the phone call. &ldquo;It is terrible what happened, but I know that my kids did not do it,&rdquo; Zubeidat said in English.

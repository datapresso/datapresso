Authorities says the &#8220;white hat&#8221; suspect from the marathon bombings, known as Suspect 2, is on the loose and is &#8220;armed and dangerous.&#8221; Police are warning residents of Watertown, about 8 kilometers from Boston, to stay inside their homes and refrain from answering the door to anyone but a police officer. Police are going door-to-door in their search for the fugitive.  VOA reporter Carolyn Presutti, who was near the scene, described the police operation as extensive.  Local public transportation has been suspended, all schools and universities are closed, some businesses are suspending operations, and police are asking people in some parts of Boston and its western suburbs to stay home Friday. Vehicles are not being allowed in or out of Watertown. Buses are evacuating area residents.  Officials say the two men accused in Monday&#8217;s marathon bombings are also suspected of fatally shooting a campus police officer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology late Thursday before stealing a car and fleeing to Watertown. Authorities say the suspects threw explosives from the car as police pursued them.  Officials say Suspect 1, pictured in FBI photos in a black baseball cap, was fatally wounded in a shootout with police and died after being taken to the hospital. Authorities at Beth Israel Hospital say the suspect arrived in cardiac arrest, with multiple gunshot wounds and signs of shrapnel injuries that could have come from an explosive blast.  On Thursday, the FBI released photographs and videotape of the two suspects taken Monday around the time of the Boston Marathon bombing. They labeled the suspect in a black baseball cap &#8220;Suspect 1&#8243; and the suspect in a white baseball cap turned backwards, &#8220;Suspect 2.&#8221; A subsequent photo of Suspect 2, taken Thursday at a convenience store, shows him in a gray hooded sweatshirt.  Monday&#8217;s twin bombings near the finish of the Boston Marathon killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy and a Chinese-born graduate student. More than 170 people were injured. Some of them lost their legs.    Other Readers Accessed These Stories: Boston bomber finally caught, town celebrates “We got him!” That was heard on the streets of ...

Another War-on-Terror Blog: Boston Marathon Bombing: Sauntering Through the News                Another War-on-Terror Blog     Welcome to the 21st century. The Cold War, WWII, and WWI are over. The 19th and 20th centuries' class conflicts and colonial issues are behind us. "Oppressed proletariat" and "European expansionism" are no longer relevant. Religious fanatics want their beliefs to rule the world. Free people want to stay that way. Here's my view of the 21st century's great conflict -                              Wednesday, May 1, 2013           Boston Marathon Bombing: Sauntering Through the News    Maybe I'd get more attention if I picked some position, and harangued endlessly about it.  Rattling on About Rosicrucians Maybe I should post daily, warning anyone who reads this blog that the Boston Marathon bombing was engineered by the same cabal of Illuminati, Rosicrucians, and space-alien lizard men who really run the CIA and NBC, control our brains with radio waves from cell phone towers, and are responsible for annoying television commercials.  Somebody might believe that tripe, though, and I don't want to be responsible for increasing the world's nuttiness.  On the other hand, maybe I'm really a shape-shifting lizard man: and have hypnotized myself into believing that I'm human.  No, I don't think so.  News and Routine There's been something in the news more-or-less daily since the Boston Marathon bombing: mostly the routine sort of stuff that news services do when there isn't a significant change to report.  That's about what I expected, since American law enforcement usually takes investigations of serious crimes in a frustratingly methodical, rational way.  There are exceptions, of course, like the infamous Steven Hatfill and Richard Jewel fiascoes. ( February 15, 2011 )  Students and Life Lessons It's likely that at least one of the three college students arrested this week got a terrible shock:  " Boston bombings: Suspect's classmates appear in court " BBC News (May 1, 2013)  " Three college classmates of the Boston bombings suspect have appeared in court, accused of hindering the police investigation into the attacks.  " Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev - both from Kazakhstan - threw away Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's laptop and backpack, police say.  " Robel Phillipos is accused of lying to investigators. None of the three are implicated in plotting the attacks.... " Maybe all three knew that they were helping terrorists. Maybe not. The young men from Kazakhstan are 19. That's 'old enough to know better,' but young enough to lack the common sense some of us eventually acquire.  I've never attended college in a foreign country, but can imagine that if had, and a buddy of mine asked me to throw a backpack and laptop away I might agree. Maybe not after I saw what was inside the backpack: but I'm nowhere near as nice and trusting a chap as some.  I won't rant about how America should drive all 'foreigners' out and not let anyone in. That, in my considered opinion, would be silly, wrong, and downright self-destructive. I'll grant that I'm a bit biased. All my ancestors were 'foreigners' here not too long ago.  Russia and Secrets Maybe Russian security officials had a good reason for not telling their American counterparts about a potential terrorist.  Maybe they were simply being the sort of bureaucratic nitwits that add fuel, knowingly or not, to weird conspiracy theories.  Or maybe the FBI is on the verge of uncovering a conspiracy of space aliens and immortal brush salesmen, disguised as Russian officials. No, I don't think so.  " No evidence Boston bomber radicalized before first FBI interview, sources say " Catherine Herridge, FoxNews.com (April 30, 2013)  " Investigators have found no evidence -- so far -- that Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was radicalized before the FBI interviewed him in spring 2011, two sources tell Fox News.  " The FBI investigation ran from March through June 2011 after the bureau was contacted by the Russian Security Services, which said Tsarnaev and his mother were followers of radical Islam.  " The two sources, one within the intelligence community and the other a congressional source, both of whom would not discuss the investigation on the record, emphasized that the U.S. went back to the Russian authorities three times seeking more detail on the elder Tsarnaev brother, but it was only within the last week that Russia's wiretap evidence was presented to U.S. authorities.  " When Tsarnaev from his six months in Russia, in July 2012, the following month he established his own YouTube channel with links to known Islamist groups, including the Caucasus Emirate. According to the two sources, no evidence has been found that Tsarnaev 'created his own media, including video recordings,' which is seen by the intelligence community as an indicator or marker of radicalization.... " What this news item seems to indicate is that American law enforcement is acting the way they usually do: and so, sadly, are their Russian counterparts.

Reading opinions contrary to what I believed has been very useful at times: sometimes verifying my previous assumptions, sometimes encouraging me to change them. Even resources which, in my opinion, are simply inaccurate are sometimes useful: these can give valuable insights into why some people or groups believe what they do.  In short, It is my opinion that some of the resources in this blogroll are neither accurate, nor unbiased. I do, however, believe that they are useful in understanding the War on Terror, the many versions of Islam, terrorism, and related topics.

Despite what's in my Blogger profile's "Interests" section, I'm only interested in three things: * What exists in the universe * What exists beyond * What might exist My background in history; a checkered work history, and guardedly hopeful attitude toward human goofiness, is off the fiftieth percentile: whether above, below, or to the side, I'm not sure.  It's a different perspective: and one which I believe sets this blog apart from most blogs dealing with this conflict.

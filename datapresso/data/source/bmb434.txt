Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been arraigned in his hospital bed and the charges against him have been sealed, court officials have told Reuters News Service.  U.S. officials brought charges against Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzohkhar Tsarnaev while he lay in his hospital bed on Monday, a federal court official said.  &#8220;There has been a sealed complaint filed,&#8221; said Gary Wente, circuit executive for the U.S. Courts for the First Circuit. He said a magistrate judge was present when Tsarnaev was charged at his bed in Boston&#8217;s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.  The White House said Monday Tsarnaev will not be tried as an enemy combatant.   About these ads   Share this:  Twitter  Facebook   Like this: Like Loading...

Posted on April 16, 2013 by The Watchdog 					 					 						      I was suspicious hearing about the bombing at the finish line at the Boston Marathon from a breaking news flash. A red flag has gone up in my head. Before I explain why, I want to get you up to speed on a few things. First we have to ask is, who stands to gain from the dead and the maimed. We have to see who has been demonizing what group as terrorist.  Do not forget who President Obama’s mentor is. Does anyone know who Bill Ayers is? Well before Obama ever served in public office as a state senator. I am talking before he was a community organizer or agitator in Chicago. Barrack Obama was living with Bill Ayers. Bill Ayers was part of the Weatherman underground responsible for terrorist attacks nationwide in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Barrack Obama was well trained by Bill Ayers and the Weather underground to carry out attacks in an attempt to destabilize the nation.  The United State Government has been behind false flag attacks. Operation Gladio, Operation North woods and Operation Ajax all designed to destabilize the nation to over throw the government through bombings and blaming it on the leader.  President Obama is no different. He is behind Operation Fast and Furious shipping guns to Mexican cartels cause the border town to be unstable with violence to blame it on Americans gun owners and the right to keep and bear arms. That has failed and is now a full blown scandal that can bring down the Obama administration.  We cannot forget the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya where military personal were ordered to stand down instead of coming to the aid to the US facility under attack. President Obama does have blood on his hands with false flag attacks. President Obama does have a formidable opposition of Americans arming themselves to the Teeth. Obama and the Political establishment are desperate to neutralize and demonize their opposition at all cost. He is desperate to find a way to discredit his real opposition  or he falls.  From the shootings of US Representative Gabriel Giffords, the movie theater in Aurora Colorado, Sandy Hook in Connecticut. They have tried to demonize the gun owners and patriots as the reason for the violence. The effort to demonize the Patriots, Veterans, gun owners, and the Christians has the lowest crime rates being upstanding people. The other side is gearing up and hyping them as the threat through network news and TV programming trying to portray these non violent groups as the enemy. That is not working well.  The reason why these groups are portrayed as the enemy of the state because they are good people standing with the truth threatens the corrupt establishment. These people who love liberty have the resources money can not buy that can discredit the President and take him down. These groups are having an effect influencing the Military and law enforcement at all level to question the upper leadership and their orders given. The opposition has been effective throwing a monkey wrench in the tyrannical machine.   internet advertising    Now the red flags I see. Since this bombing at the Boston marathon has happened. I know they are looking for some way to blame it on Obama&#8217;s political enemies. What I see is at the finish line looks like an inside job. First there is so many cameras and media presence at the finish line. Second the Bomb squad had the bomb sniffing dogs saying &#8220;this is a drill please be calm&#8221; Third Boston and the state of Massachusetts is Police State central occupied by the most authoritarian people in office. This shows Obama has many collaborators inside the City and State government to help carry out an operation. There was a Police Presence around the finish line, how could they have missed it? Fourth, why were there very little people around the explosion? There was not a crowd of people around the finish line. Anyone would figure there would be so much more people near the finish line seeing the runners finish the race. Its smells like an inside job. This bombing most likely could not happen unless there is help from the inside in an area that is secured.  Who stands to gain from this incident? It is the US government who stands to grab more power as an excuse. They want a further police state with check points and the further elimination of our rights in the name of keeping us safe. They need an enemy to justify tyranny in the name of keep us safe.  When you look at the underwear bomber that boarded a plane without a passport guided around security with a government operative was used as the excuse to put full body scanners and groping at the airports. That was a government operation start to finish.  When we look at the various FBI stings where they recruited a disgruntled person low IQ. They gave the cash and fake explosives to carry out a terrorist attack. They FBI control the operation start to finish posing as the saviors to justify their existence.  The American people no longer trust the US government. The people no longer buy the official story of the JFK assassination with the Warren report or the official story September 11 with the 9-11 commission report. The Official story what happened at the Branch Davidian church and the Oklahoma City Bombing has been discredited.  The US government wants to escalate a crisis as an excuse for mass arrest and gun confiscation to suspend the Constitution and bring in a Dictatorship. They need an enemy to go after.  They will stage bombings and blame it on their political enemies.  They play dirty and do not play fair.  We have to keep exposing the government using false flag events to advance their own gain for power at the expense of the people. This bombing was not done in a vacuum. A lot of people are watching and asking questions. We must be the people who will be the watchmen on the wall, if we do not the terrorist in government win. We have to shake of the fear and stand our ground      internet advertising   											 					 						This entry was posted in Uncategorized .

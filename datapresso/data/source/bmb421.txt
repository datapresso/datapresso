Tsarnaeva, 23, sister of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, allegedly impeded an investigation into the use of counterfeit money in 2010. She had been sought on an arrest warrant for more than two years and is currently living in New Jersey. She left the courthouse and was whisked past a throng of media into a waiting car. Her lawyer, George Gormley, said, &ldquo;No comment.&rdquo; Gormley said in court that his client, who was going back to New Jersey, had no objections to a provision that she check in with the Massachusetts probation office once a week. He said she was unlikely to flee, citing the fact that she has a one-year-old child and is pregnant with another child. &ldquo;She is here voluntarily to get herself in good standing with the court,&rdquo; he said. Prosecutors said that someone passed counterfeit money at the South Bay Mall in Boston in August 2010 and Tsarnaeva picked up the person who passed the money. When questioned about it, she acknowledged she was there but was uncooperative about who was involved, prosecutors said. That led to a charge that she had misled and impeded an investigation. She was arraigned in South Boston District Court in January 2011 and has been sought on a default warrant since February 2011. A pretrial hearing was set for Dec. 4, but the judge ruled that she didn&rsquo;t have to appear in person for that hearing. Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly planted the bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line that killed three and wounded more than 260 others. They also are accused of murdering an MIT police officer. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed when he was run over by his own brother and shot during a confrontation with police in Watertown several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, escaped a police dragnet after the shootout but was found later the same day hiding in a boat in a Watertown back yard. He faces federal charges that could bring him the death penalty. The Record of Bergen County, N.J., reported in late May that the brothers&rsquo; other sister, Bella Tsarnaeva, had pleaded not guilty to marijuana charges after marijuana was found at her Fairview home in December 2012. The paper also said that only a few days after the bombing federal agents went to Ailina Tsarnaeva&rsquo;s West New York home. After interviewing her, the agents left with computers, cellphones and plastic bags full of other items, the Record reported. - See more at: http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/10/16/tsarnaevs-sister-ailina-released-after-court-appearance-counterfeiting-case/rQpkOIE7L72wmfipghvqNK/story.html#sthash.6eYJApSD.dpuf  																							 							  Click Here To Write A Comment 								 																  	 							 							      Tagged as:           Trending ,         Tamerlan Tsarnaev ,         Ailina Tsarnaev ,         Dzhokhar Tsarnae ,         Boston Marathon bombs            							  														        	 		   												 	 	 Write Your Comment 																							 		 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

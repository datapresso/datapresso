Thank you.&quot;							  							 Screen shot, Comedy Central							 							 						 					 									  						 							 																																									 						 A s Americans continue to grieve for the victims of Monday's bombings at the Boston Marathon, many have turned to late-night programs for normalcy and comfort &mdash; and on Tuesday night, both The Daily Show and The Colbert Report began with their hosts offering distinctive and moving tributes to the city of Boston before providing some much-needed levity. (Both shows aired previously scheduled re-runs on Monday night.) Take a look at the homages from hosts Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert:  1. Jon Stewart   "Once again, having to start under horrific events here in this country. I really hate the fact that I can cross-reference my thoughts to so many other events that have occurred over the years &mdash; so I'm not going to. I'm just going to say this to Boston: Thank you. Thank you for once again, in the face of gross inhumanity, inspiring and solidifying my belief in humanity and the people of this country. So thank you for everything you've done. It's a quite a little city you've got going on up there. And New Yorkers and Boston obviously have kind of a little bit of a competition. Often, the two cities accusing each other of various levels of suckitude. But it is in situations like this that we realize it is clearly a sibling rivalry , and that we are your brothers and sisters in this type of event. As a city that knows the feeling of confusion, anger, and grief, and chaos that comes with these events, I can tell you from personal experience: You've got a hell of a city going on, and you've done an incredible job in the face of all this. Thank you."  2. Stephen Colbert   "Tonight &mdash; look, before we begin, I just want to take a moment to talk about the attack in Boston yesterday. Obviously, our thoughts and our prayers are with everybody there. And as the president said, we don't know who did this, but they will be found, and they will be brought to justice. But whoever did this obviously did not know shit about the people of Boston. Because nothing these terrorists do is going to shake them. For Pete's sake, Boston was founded by the pilgrims &mdash; a people so tough they had to buckle their goddamn hats on . It is the cradle of the American revolution. A city that withstood an 86-year losing streak. A city that made it through the Big Dig, a construction project that backed up traffic for 16 years &mdash; I mean, there are commuters just getting home now . Even their bands are tough. It's the hometown of Aerosmith, who are, in their fifth decade, still going strong. Even Steven Tyler looks fantastic, for a 73-year-old woman.  But here is what these cowards really don't get. They attacked the Boston Marathon. An event celebrating people who run 26 miles on their day off until their nipples are raw for fun . And they have been holding it in Boston since 1897. And do you know how tough you have to be to run in a whalebone corset? And when those bombs went off, there were runners who, after finishing a marathon, kept running for another two miles to the hospital to donate blood.  So here's what I know. These maniacs may have tried to make life bad for the people of Boston, but all they can ever do is show just how good those people are." 						 					 				 				 				  						 	 	 	 		 	  					  					   Print 						 					 				 								 					 					 					 						 							 Scott Meslow 						 						 							 Follow @scottmeslow 						 						 							Scott Meslow is the entertainment editor for TheWeek.com .

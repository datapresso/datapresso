The FBI searched the home that Tamerlan shared with his wife and young daughter.  A source briefed on the investigation said investigators found explosives residue in the small apartment. It has turned up in at least three places, the source said: the kitchen table, the kitchen sink and the bathtub, according to CNN.  The suspect's younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has told authorities that they built the bombs there.  On Sunday, Tamerlan's body remained at a funeral home, where his uncle said he was trying to deal with the logistics of readying the body for burial.  "I'm here to prepare his body - to wash it, shroud it, to prepare his body," Ruslan Tsarni was quoted as saying.  The funeral home owner, Peter Stefan, said he still has to find a cemetery willing to accept the body for burial.  Three cemeteries that Stefan contacted said they feared reprisals, but the funeral home owner said you can't pick and choose when it comes to a burial.

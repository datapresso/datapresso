Tsarnaev, 19, is the remaining suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings &mdash; the subject of a massive manhunt Friday morning in Watertown, Massachusetts, multiple sources reported Friday morning. [ UPDATE AT 11PM: Boston Bombing Suspect Alive And In Custody . ] His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, has been identified as the first suspect and died overnight following a firefight with police. NBC News&#8217; Pete Williams said earlier Friday morning that the two suspects likely had &#8220;foreign military training,&#8221; and had been in the country for about a year. Later he said they were brothers, and added , &#8220;They were legal permanent residents. They were in this country legally, at least a year. They appear to be from Turkey, possibly Chechens from Turkey. That seems to be the nationality here.&#8221; As more information became available, multiple source reported that Dzhokhar was born in Kyrgyzstan and Tamerlan was born in Russia. Just before 7 a.m. Friday morning, the Associated Press confirmed Williams&#8217; reporting and naming Tsarnaev. Born July 22, 1993, according to Williams, Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, has a Massachusetts driver&#8217;s license, and has been in the country for around a decade. CBS reported that he became a naturalized U.S. citizen on Sept. 11, 2012. He is a registered student at UMass Dartmouth, according to the school, where he lived in a dorm. The school was evacuated at 10 a.m. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, although NBC initially reported he was 20, was 26. He became a lawful permanent resident, according to NBC, in 2007. He maintained a YouTube page that focused on Sunni Islam and included a playlist named &#8220;terrorist.&#8221; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev&#8217;s online profile is more secular, though his &#8220;World view&#8221; on Vkontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, is listed as &#8220;Islam&#8221; and his &#8220;Personal priority&#8221; is &#8220;career and money.&#8221; Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following a firefight with police , suffering from what doctors at the hospital where he was pronounced dead said were &#8220;blast and potentially gunshot wounds &#8230; probably a blast injury [and] possibly shrapnel&#8221; throughout his trunk. 				  		 3.

The newscaster's are claiming it to be terrorist's work, the agenda of the Conservative Tea Party, the Conservative Party in general, and many other 'theories' they have riled up in an attempt to put a name to what exactly happened. That is merely human nature, to rationalize and reason events however traumatizing they may be. Honestly, I don't care who did it. I don't. It can be the KKK, Conservative Party, North Koreans, Muslims, angry Americans. I. Don't. Care. I don't care who you are, or what you've done or what you believe was right. You killed innocent people and injured hundreds, if not with physical wounds, then emotional. There were not just Americans in that crowd, but Arabians, Europeans, Chinese, Australians, Germans, South Americans- At least one family from every continent was there cheering on their loved ones in the chance of a lifetime. They gathered to America in rejoice, of freedom, of opportunity, of national pride. You took that away. You took away the smiles and laughter of children. You took away the feeling of security, safety, that I believe I can assume everyone treasures and holds dear. You took away the loving gleam in a fathers eye as he beamed, seconds from crossing the finish line, ready to reunite with his family. You took away everything for some. So I, an American citizen, ask- no beg you to go home tonight, hug your wife, daughters, sons, mother, close. Then I want you to lay in bed and dream, dream for the last time in your life because honey, prepare for the hell storm that will follow your actions. I'm not one for violence, and I'll be the first to grab a gun the second someone threatens MY security, MY happiness, MY freedom. I hope that you enjoyed your little show, because I will not let you hurt anymore families, tear anymore bonds, or threaten anymore lives with your sick, undeserving wants. *** This is a picture depicting a teenage boy after he heard of the bombing, his mother was attending the marathon and he can't get hold of her on the phone. All he's left with are repetitive newscasts.                 Load All Images                                         ~ TiedyeKat       Apr 20, 2013                    DX Poor guy!!

I mean that literally, we'll dine, fuck and dash. The Earth is hollow but we still drill through. Space is a concept evidently named. I'm a warrior and you be the princess, you're already rescued, promised to curses. is a line is a line is a line is a line and I'm in enigmas, sure by shore leaves. sunken ships launch from the beach front and take their ghosts, a secret suicide. If ants drew us and we marched past, would it be any different, would it be any different? in a line to end all lines, and seductive co-workers fling their shit at me. once primal, always primal, just anthropomorphic. I'm just a collection of piss stains, wrung out and forgotten stinky and melancholic. addicted to that pin-prick well, settling for justice with a bucket, we dip our heads into water and crack the rot over bemusement.

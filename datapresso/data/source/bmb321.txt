The first suspect, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed April 18th following a shootout with police. His younger brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, escaped after the shootout, reportedly running over his fallen brother in the process.   The city of Boston was shut down as police and other officials urged residents to stay inside their houses with the doors locked. Local schools and businesses were also closed, as officers went door to door looking for Dzhokar.  When the extensive search failed to uncover the suspect, residents were told it was okay to go ahead and leave their houses. Shortly after this announcement, a man saw blood on his boat that was parked outside and alerted officials. Responders found the wounded suspect in the boat. When the officers&#8217; attempts to get Dzhokar to come out of the craft of his own accord failed, shots were fired on both sides, and the suspect was taken into custody.  As of April 20th, Tsarnaev was listed in serious condition at a Boston hospital. His state left him unable to be questioned by officers immediately, but plans are in place to interrogate the suspect, and officials are hopeful they will get much-needed answers.  Chechen leader blames U.S. for Boston bombing 59  The Russian-installed leader of Chechnya criticized U.S. police on Friday for killing an ethnic Chechen suspected of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing and blamed the violence on his upbringing in the United States.  “The root of evil should be looked for in the United States,” Ramzan Kadyrov said in comments posted online after the police shot dead Tamerlan Tsarnaev and hunted for his brother Dzhokhar, his suspected accomplice.  “They (the brothers) grew up and studied in the United States and their attitudes and beliefs were formed there,” Kadyrov said. “Any attempt to make a connection between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs is in vain.”  on The Web:  http://www.chron.com/news/article/Final-shootout-then-Boston-bombing-suspect-caught-4449696.php  											 											 										  														 				 	 					 Tags: featured  								 	 			 			 	 		 			 	    	    	     	      Jason Marin 	     Jason is a native of Calgary but now spends his days on the East Coast in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland. Jason has been working part-time for eCanadNow since 2010.Jason mostly covers sci/tech stories as well as entertainment news. Prior to his work writing and editing for eCanadaNow, he worked in sales and marketing.You can email Jason at {Jason at ecanadanow.com] 	     	       				 			 		     			 		 	 	 		 					 			 				 RSS Get updates 				 Google Plus Join our circle 				 Twitter Follow us 				 Facebook Become our fan 							 			 		 		  Ad 			  		 Top Stories From eCanadaNow 					 						 						 Elderly Couple Dies Holding Hands In Crash (PHOTO) 					 									 						 						 Singapore model found dead in ditch, real estate broker arrested 					 									 						 						 Yeti a bear hybrid?: New Proof That The Abominable Snowman Exists 					 									 						 						 Johann Sebastian Bach&#039;s IQ was 165, Who Had An IQ Of 225?

Debate Club                                Should the Boston Bombing Suspect be Tried as an Enemy Combatant?    	The day-long manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, allegedly the second Boston Marathon bomber, came to an end Friday night when the suspect was found gravely injured in a boat in Watertown, Mass. Tsarnaev, who is recovering from his injuries, was officially charged on Monday with using a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property. Tsarnaev&#39;s charges carry a maximum penalty of death.  	With the charge, the government confirmed that it will be trying Tsarnaev in civilian court, not treating him as an enemy combatant subject to a military form of justice. &quot;We will prosecute this terrorist through our civilian system of justice. Under U.S. law, United States citizens cannot be tried in military commissions,&quot; White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said.  	However, many Republicans in Congress believe that Tsarnaev should be held and tried as an enemy combatant. &quot;It is clear the events we have seen over the past few days in Boston were an attempt to kill American citizens and terrorize a major American city,&quot; said a release from Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). &quot;The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim and kill innocent Americans.&quot;  	Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., also called for Tsarnaev to be held as an enemy combatant for intelligence purposes. &quot;I&#39;m not worried about a conviction. I want the intelligence,&quot; he said. Tsarnaev was not immediately read his Miranda rights upon his capture, as officials invoked the so-called &quot;public safety exemption,&quot; which allows limited questioning of suspects if officials believe there is an imminent threat to the public.  	But other members of Congress, including Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., aligned themselves with the administration in calling for Tsarnaev to be tried in civilian court. &quot;I don&#39;t think we have to cross the line and say he should be an enemy combatant,&quot; Schumer said during an appearance on CNN. Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security, added, &quot;I think it&#39;s an important statement especially after what this city went through to say, &#39;Yup, now you&#39;re just a normal criminal and we&#39;re just going to put you through the process.&#39;&quot;  	So should the alleged Boston bomber be tried as an enemy combatant?

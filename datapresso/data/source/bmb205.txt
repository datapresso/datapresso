The Tsarneavs were on welfare in Boston, Dzhokar also got college money and now we see this sister allegedly involved with counterfeiters.  One man&#8217;s family-how lovely!  Via WCVB:  BOSTON â€”The sister of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appeared in court Wednesday in connection with a counterfeit bill case.  Ailna Tsarnaeva appeared in South Boston District Court to remove a default she incurred by failing to appear on a 2011 court date in a case charging her with misleading an investigator assigned to a counterfeit bill investigation, officials said.  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is awaiting federal charges in connection with the April 15 bombing that claimed the lives of three people and injured more than 260 others. Her other brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a shootout with police.  Tsarnaeva is accused of driving a car for a suspect who passed a counterfeit bill at an Applebee&#8217;s restaurant in Dorchester in 2010.  A defense attorney argued that his client is pregnant and has no money for bail. She was released on $1,500 bail and is scheduled to appear in court in December.  At the time of the bombings, Tsarnaeva was living in West New York, N.J., with her husband and baby. When questioned about her brothers, Tsarnaeva told federal agents she had not been in contact with them for years.  Speaking after the incident, she said she was sorry for the families that lost loved ones &#8220;the same way I lost my loved one.&#8221;  &#8220;He was a great person,&#8221; the woman said of her dead brother. &#8220;I thought I knew him. I never would have expected that from him. He is a kind and loving man. The cops took his life away just the same way he took others&#8217; lives away, if that&#8217;s even true. At the end of the day, no one knows the truth.&#8221;     				 				 Nickarama | October 17, 2013 11:24 am 				   				 			 			 		 				 		 			 				 			  		  			  		  			  		  			 Recent Comments Powered by Disqus

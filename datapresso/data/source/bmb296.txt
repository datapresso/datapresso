Police squads and armoured personnel carriers raced to the district where the suspect was believed to be hiding in a boat in the back garden of a house on Friday night local time (Saturday morning AEST).         Police helicopters buzzed overhead and bomb squad vans and ambulances were in position around the house at 63 Franklin Street in Watertown.    The Boston Globe quoted a source as saying police had 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev "pinned down." CNN said police believed they had the suspect surrounded.     Advertisement      Gunfire erupted in the district only minutes after police told a press conference they believed that Tsarnaev had escaped a mass dragnet thrown over Watertown.    Chechen brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are the main suspects in Monday's Boston marathon bombing, in which three people were killed and about 180 injured.    Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a shootout with police in the early hours of Friday after an earlier gunbattle in which a police officer was shot dead.    Meanwhile, The Associated Press reports the FBI interviewed older suspect 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in 2011 at request of foreign government but nothing was found.     &#169; 2013  AFP                                               Tweet                submit to reddit   Email article       Print                                Advertisement                         Most popular                    1                  Six Australians killed in Laos plane crash              Contains:                      2                  McCann appeal gets 2400 contacts              Contains:                      3                  Congress pulls US back from brink              Contains:                      4                  Finance News Update, what you need to know              Contains:                      5                  Finance News Update, what you need to know              Contains:                          Selections Video More video                Tears of a champion      AFL great Simon Black says it has been a 'privilege and an honour" as he announces his AFL retirement Friday, and is offered "any role he wants" with the club.

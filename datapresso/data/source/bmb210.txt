Sean Murphy/Massachusetts State Police Dzhokhar Tsarnaev emerging from a land-docked boat the night of his arrest. The man who discovered suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding in his Watertown, Mass. boat described to The Boston Globe how the events of that evening unfolded.  Retired technician David Henneberry said he saw Tsarnaev "curled in a fetal position, wearing a hoodie and dark shoes" when he went to check on his boat after noticing that some padding was out of place. The boat was being stored in his backyard.  From The Globe's story:  Henneberry said the truth is he would never have approached his shrink-wrapped Seabird if he had an inkling the alleged terrorist was inside.  "If I had seen blood out there, I wouldn&rsquo;t have investigated it," he said in one of the few interviews he has given in recent months. "I&rsquo;m not crazy."  In August, photos were released showing Tsarnaev emerging from the boat the night that police captured him and ended the manhunt for him and his older brother, Tamerlan, who died in a shootout with police.  Dzhokhar is now facing charges relating to the Boston Marathon bombing, which police suspect him of carrying out with Tamerlan. The April attacks killed three people and injured more than 260 others.  Read the full story at The Boston Globe &gt;    					 	         		 			 		 		 	 		 	 	 			 			 			 		 		 		 	 	 		 Email 	 	 		 More			 				 					 																	 					 												 Share on Tumblr 					 					 																		 																	 					 												 											 				 			 		 	  				 		 		 			 				 x 				 To embed this post, copy the code below and paste into your website or blog. 				 					 600px wide (preview) 					 					 &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/embed?id=525ef3feeab8ea1078928bf9&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=430&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 				 				 					 400px wide (preview) 					 					 &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/embed?id=525ef3feeab8ea1078928bf9&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=430&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 				 				 					 300px wide (preview) 					    					 &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/embed?id=525ef3feeab8ea1078928bf9&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=430&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 				   			 		 	 			 			 				 									 Alerts 							 			 				 Newsletter 			 							 					 URL 					 						 						 							 						 					 				 					 	 			   Recommended For You                                                                                    		 					      More:                  Boston Marathon Bombings           Boston Globe           Dzhokhar Tsarnaev                       Get Alerts for these topics &#187;          			                                   Pamela Engel                                                                     Ohio University Police Chief Criticizes Crowd For Filming Apparent Sexual Assault Instead Of Stopping It                     			 		 Advertisement: 		 		 		 		 	  	 			 		 Join The Discussion 		 		 			 			 			 		  		 	 		 		 													 							 											 		 	 				 					 OR 											 Login With Facebook 																  Login With Twitter 							   		      Login With Google 		   		 	 		  			 			  			 							 								 	 			 	 				 														 								 									 Submit the comment for Insider Status								 							 																	 			  			 		 	 	      Comments     	  		 			 				 					 						Insiders						 0 					 				 				 					 						All Comments						 3 					 				                   Apply To Be An "Insider" &#187;            			 		 	          Loading                      Watertown Resident Describes Finding Boston Bombing Suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev In His Boat   Watertown Resident Describes Finding Boston Bombing Suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev In His Boat     The man who discovered suspected Boston...

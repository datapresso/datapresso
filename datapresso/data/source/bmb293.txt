Final shootout, then Boston bombing suspect captured - Latest News - Jamaica Observer Mobile          Full Site  Thursday, October 17, 2013  	       Home | News | Sport | Entertainment | Business | Cartoon | Other Sections 	     	    Latest News  Final shootout, then Boston bombing suspect captured  Saturday, April 20, 2013    WATERTOWN, Massachusetts (AP) -- For just a few minutes, it seemed as if the dragnet that had shut down a metropolitan area of millions while legions of police went house to house looking for the suspected Boston Marathon bomber had failed. Weary officials lifted a daylong order that had kept residents in their homes, saying it was fruitless to keep an entire city locked down. Then one man emerged from his home and noticed blood on the pleasure boat parked in his backyard. He lifted the tarp and found the wounded 19-year-old college student known the world over as Suspect No. 2. Soon after that, the 24-hour drama that paralysed a city and transfixed a nation was over. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's capture touched off raucous celebrations in and around Boston, with chants of "USA, USA" as residents flooded the streets in relief and jubilation after four tense days since twin explosions ripped through the marathon's crowd at the finish line, killing three people and wounding more than 180. The 19-year-old - whose older brother and alleged accomplice was killed earlier Friday morning in a wild shootout in suburban Boston - was in serious condition Saturday at a hospital protected by armed guards, and he was unable to be questioned to determine his motives. US officials said a special interrogation team for high-value suspects would question him without reading him his Miranda rights, invoking a rare public safety exception triggered by the need to protect police and the public from immediate danger. President Barack Obama said there are many unanswered questions about the Boston bombings, including whether the two men had help from others. He urged people not to rush judgment about their motivations. Dzhokhar and his brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, were identified by authorities and relatives as ethnic Chechens from southern Russia who had been in the US for about a decade and were believed to be living in Cambridge, just outside Boston. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died early in the day of gunshot wounds and a possible blast injury. He was also run over by his younger brother in a car as he lay wounded, according to investigators. During a long night of violence Thursday and into Friday, the brothers killed an MIT police officer, severely wounded another lawman during a gun battle and hurled explosives at police in a desperate getaway attempt, authorities said. Late Friday, less than an hour after authorities lifted the lockdown, they tracked down the younger man holed up in the boat, weakened by a gunshot wound after fleeing on foot from the overnight shootout with police that left 200 spent rounds behind. The resident who spotted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in his boat in his Watertown yard called police, who tried to persuade the suspect to get out of the boat, said Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis. "He was not communicative," Davis said. Instead, he said, there was an exchange of gunfire - the final volley of one of the biggest manhunts in American history. 	             SHARE THIS:       More news   							 Eight outstanding Jamaicans awarded Musgrave medals 									 WICB denies reports Ottis Gibson is quitting 									 Employers could face sanctions for HIV-related discrimination under new bill 									 Jamaica Get All Right earns maximum points 									 New Cable and Wireless head takes office January 2014 									 Would-be robber stopped in his tracks 									 Holness camp accuses Shaw of plagiarising Five-Point development plan 									 Four-member Jamaican team set for XVIII Pan American Badminton Champs 									 Condolence book for 'Foggy' Mullings opens in Miami 									 Forex: J$105.16 to one US dollar 									 6 face charges after boat capsizes off Miami 									 Update: TEF gives police $45m to buy vehicles, $40m for Marine patrol in west 									 Ellington shoots down rumours of political bias 									 Fraser-Pryce signs new deal with Grace Kennedy 									 45 people detained in Clarendon Police operation 									 Two killers serving life mistakenly released in Florida 									 Three Caricom countries linked to modern day slavery 									 Alia Atkinson mines gold 									 Toyota recalls more than 800,000 US vehicles for air bag defects 									 PJ Patterson 'greatly deprived' by George Lee passing 									 Blocked drains leave Corletts Avenue under smelly water 									 Outdoor air pollution a leading cause of cancer, says WHO 									 Motorists no longer ignoring Gorge early flood warning -- Police 									 George Lee honoured in Lakeside, Florida 									 US Government open again, Obama bemoans damage 					    		 More...

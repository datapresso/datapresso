The move comes after some Senate Republicans wanted the suspect to be tied as an enemy combatant. Congressman Howard P. &#8220;Buck&#8221; McKeon, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee has cautioned that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev&#8217;s status as enemy combatant is yet to be ascertained. &#8220;&#8230; it seems premature to declare that we will not treat Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant since we do not know enough about his affiliations,&#8221; he said. However, Press Secretary Jay Carney on 22nd April had said that the brothers did not exhibit a terrorist connection. &#8220;FBI followed up on the information that it received (from Russians) about Tamerlan Tsarnaev (in 2011), the older brother. They investigated it thoroughly and did not find terrorist activity, domestic or foreign.&#8221; As per FBI, Russia had sought information on Tamerlan based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country’s region to join unspecified underground groups.

Clearly American citizens must be tried in civilian courts, but the same citizen, having viciously attacked his countrymen, must be exploited for his intelligence value before any trial begins.&#8221; He was referring to Jay Carney&#8217;s remark &#8220;The effective use of the criminal justice system has resulted in the interrogation, conviction and detention of both U.S. citizens and noncitizens for acts of terrorism committed inside the United States and around the world.&#8221; Meanwhile, FBI announced that Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction (IED) against persons and property at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, resulting in the death of three people and injuries to more than 200 people.

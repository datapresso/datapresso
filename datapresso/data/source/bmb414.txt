Later in the week there's an interview with the Today Show. A few days after that, a trip to California, where the organization that helped her get prosthetic legs is celebrating its 20th anniversary.  House calls from a pilates instructor. Driving lessons. An appointment with an architect looking to modify the home so Corcoran can get around more easily.  "There hasn't been a normal day since April 15," she said. "People say, 'What's a normal day like?' There just isn't one. My family just hasn't settled into it."  On April 15, Corcoran and her daughter Sydney were on Boylston Street, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded.  She lost both her legs in the blast. Her daughter's femoral artery was severed, requiring three initial surgeries, followed by more later on.  Six months later, both Corcoran women are out of the hospital and still healing, navigating a world suddenly transformed.  Sydney, 18, graduated Lowell High School in the spring, after winning the title of prom queen and receiving a full scholarship to Merrimack College from M/A-COM Technology Solutions.  Fitted with state-of-the-art prosthetic legs, Celeste, 47, is walking again, though she says she's still unsteady. She's looking into getting a service dog to help her keep her balance, in part to help her return to work as a hair stylist at a Boston salon.  "I'm definitely not confident to just kind of take a walk outside by myself, or go anywhere by myself for that matter, but I can see it coming," she said. "Like I know that I will be able to."  The ground-floor room where she sits as she speaks, in the Pawtucketville home she shares with her husband Kevin, her 20-year-old son Tyler, Sydney, two cats and two dogs, was the family's dining room earlier this year.  Now, across from the desk sits a daybed, where Celeste sometimes goes back to sleep after Kevin carries her downstairs when he leaves for work around 5:30 a.m. In various spots across the room, a pillow, a teddy bear and other gifts broadcast the affirmation, "Corcoran Strong."  Married for 24 years, Corcoran and her husband have lived here for 23. They're now planning to move from the house into a one-story home they're building in Dracut.   "I guess if I could say one thing, there's been nothing normal," Corcoran said, fighting back tears. "That's probably one of the hardest things for somebody, and it's not just me. Anybody that has a traumatic event like that, you know? You never expect it, and in a blink of an eye, your entire world just changes forever, so it's really, really, really hard to adjust and to create a new normal."  For Corcoran, the differences span a range: physical therapy teaching her how to use all her body's muscles when walking, a new vocabulary, with terms like "stent" and "angiogram," to discuss her daughter's medical care, a new set of concerns when picking out an outfit.  Skirts and shorts, she said, are easier to put on -- and make it easier for others to see her prosthetics. She doesn't want to draw attention to the artificial limbs, but if strangers can see them, they'll understand why she's unsteady on her feet.  "It literally just feels like you're standing on stilts," Corcoran said about the legs. "Nothing about it feels natural or normal. I thought it'd be like putting on a boot and having it be attached to you somehow."  Corcoran is preparing to take another automobile road test, proving she can drive safely with her prosthetics. She had her first local driving lesson last week, after taking a car out once in Florida this summer, under the guidance of her Orlando-based prosthetist.  Getting behind the wheel will get her closer to independence and closer to returning to work, she said.  Before April, Corcoran worked three long days a week at Emerge Salon on Newbury Street. She's been cutting hair since she was 17 and said she misses the artistry of it and the personal connections with her clients.  She's in the process of easing back in, with regular trips to the salon for her own hair-color appointments every two to three weeks.  "The first few times when I went there, I just cried," Corcoran said. "I just felt like it was so sad, and I couldn't see myself back there again. I just felt so helpless, just in the wheelchair. I don't know. It was just so, so hard at first."  On a recent trip, Corcoran's son Tyler took her into the city, with plans for one of her coworkers to do both their hair.  "But we got there a little early," she said. "So I was like, 'Ty, you know what? Why don't I just do it? I can cut your hair. You can be the first person in my chair.' So I cut his hair in my chair, and it felt neat to be in my space, doing my thing."  Follow Katie Lannan on Twitter and Tout @katielannan.

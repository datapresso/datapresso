religious motive seen 	 						 							 BOSTON BOMBING: Suspect charged; religious motive seen 							 																	 24/04/2013 07:18:00 								 																											 David Crary and Denise Lavoie, Boston 																											 							 								 		Font size:		 		 	 							        																		 										 										 Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 									 																 								 The two brothers suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon appear to have been motivated by a radical brand of Islam but do not seem connected to any Muslim terrorist groups, U.S. officials said after interrogating and charging Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with crimes that could bring the death penalty. Tsarnaev, 19, was charged the day before yesterday in his hospital room, where he was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the throat and other injuries suffered during his attempted getaway. His older brother, Tamerlan, 26, died Friday after a fierce gunbattle with police. Dzhokhar communicated with his interrogators in writing, precluding the type of back-and-forth exchanges often crucial to establishing key facts and meaning, according to officials who cautioned that they were still trying to verify what they were told and are also looking at the suspect's telephone and online communications. The Massachusetts university student was charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. He was accused of joining with his brother in setting off the shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs that killed three people and wounded more than 200 a week ago. The brothers, ethnic Chechens from Russia who had been living in the U.S. for about a decade, practiced Islam. Two U.S. officials said preliminary evidence from the younger man's interrogation suggests the brothers were motivated by religious extremism but were apparently not involved with Islamic terrorist organizations. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. In the criminal complaint outlining the allegations, investigators said Tsarnaev and his brother each placed a knapsack containing a bomb in the crowd near the finish line of the world's most prestigious marathon. The FBI said surveillance-camera footage showed Dzhokhar manipulating his mobile phone and lifting it to his ear just instants before the two blasts. He then quickly walked away, leaving a knapsack on the ground; about 10 seconds later, a bomb blew up at the spot where he had been standing, the FBI said. The FBI did not say whether he was using his cellphone to detonate one or both of the bombs or whether he was talking to someone. The criminal complaint shed no light on the motive for the attack. The Obama administration said it had no choice but to prosecute Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the federal court system. Some politicians had suggested he be tried as an enemy combatant in front of a military tribunal, where defendants are denied some of the usual constitutional protections. But Tsarnaev is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and under U.S. law, American citizens cannot be tried by military tribunals, White House spokesman Jay Carney said. State prosecutors have said they expect to charge Tsarnaev separately in the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who was shot in his cruiser Thursday night on the campus in Cambridge. After Tsarnaev is indicted in the bombing, he will have an arraignment in federal court, when he will be asked to enter a plea. Under federal law, as a defendant charged with a crime that carries a potential death penalty, he is entitled to at least one lawyer who is knowledgeable about the law in capital cases. Federal Public Defender Miriam Conrad, whose office has been asked to represent Tsarnaev, filed a motion the day before yesterday asking that two death penalty lawyers be appointed to represent Tsarnaev, "given the magnitude of this case." A probable cause hearing &mdash; at which prosecutors will spell out the basics of their case &mdash; was set for May 30. According to a clerk's notes of the day before eysterday's proceedings in the hospital, U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler indicated she was satisfied that Tsarnaev was "alert and able to respond to the charges." As of yesterday, 51 people remained hospitalized, three of them in critical condition. At least 14 people lost all or part of a limb; three of them lost more than one.

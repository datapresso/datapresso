Falsely Identified &quot;Boston Bombing&quot; Suspect Found Dead               Submitted by Tyler Durden on 04/25/2013 10:45 -0400             The amateur detective sleuths on 4Chan, Reddit and other social sites were so eager to demonstrate their investigative prowess in the information vacuum days following the Boston Bombing, they managed to identify virtually everyone who appeared even slightly tanned and/or had a backpack as a potential suspect. Sadly, the game, as well-meaning as it may have been, just turned lethal for one of the people who were falsely identified, as NBC just confirmed that Sunil Tripathi, 22, a former student at Brown University has been found dead in the Providence River.    From NBC's twitter feed:  CONFIRMED: Brown University student falsely identified as Boston bombing suspect found dead in Providence River  — NBC News (@NBCNews) April 25, 2013  Previously from the Boston Globe :  Police in Providence pulled a man’s body from the Providence River on Tuesday, and authorities said it is “very possible” that it is Sunil Tripathi, 22, a former Brown University student who has been missing since mid-March.   Providence police Lieutenant Joseph Donnelly said Tuesday night that “it’s very, very possible” that the body could be Tripathi’s, but also said authorities will not know for sure until the medical examiner’s office in Providence identifies the body Wednesday morning. Donnelly said Tripathi’s family has not been notified of the body’s recovery.   Donnelly said the body was found in the river behind the Wyndham Garden Providence Hotel at around 6 p.m. The coach of Brown’s rowing team, which practices in that area, saw the body floating in the water and called police, Donnelly said.   Tripathi was last seen in his apartment on Angell Street in Providence around 11 a.m. on March 16.   And more :  Reddit forum apologized to Tripathi's family for naming him as the suspect accused of setting off a series of explosions near the marathon's finish line. "I'd like to extend the deepest apologies to the family of Sunil Tripathi for any part we may have had in relaying what has turned out to be faulty information," the moderator wrote in a statement. "We cannot begin to know what you're going through and for that we are truly sorry.   A woman who went to high school with Tripathi wrongfully named him as one of the men wanted by the FBI. "Several users, twitter users, and other sources had heard him identified as the suspect and believed it to be confirmed," the statement continued. " We were mistaken ."   Reddit's general manager, Erik Martin, also apologized to the family.   The accusation added Tripathi to a list of others mistaken for the suspects, or targeted, based on their skin color. Last week, a Bangladeshi man from the Bronx was beaten out of retaliation for the marathon attack, which he had nothing to do with.   Perhaps it is time to reevaluate the crowdsourced approach to "solving" crimes? Perhaps it is also time to remember the whole "innocent until proven guilty" saying, as meaningless as it may be in our day and age.     &raquo;  58076 reads  Printer-friendly version  Send to friend       Similar Articles You Might Enjoy:    RANsquawk EU Market Re-Cap - 19th April 2013  What Exactly Did Obama Say To Wall Street's CEOs Last Thursday?

Thu, 04/25/2013 - 11:42 |      Jekyll_n_Hyde_Island             Deductive logic and inference. These are things you lack, cave troll. See below for your cerebral ass whooping.  - Man was FORMER student of Brown. [Classic yay or crystal drop out scenario]  - Man disappears March 16th [see above] --&gt; Probably running the streets hustling/pushing etc...  - Man found in river April 25th  - Man hasn't been floating in river for probably more than 3 days.  - Man slightly resembles due to facial structure and skin tone the younger of the two brothers.  - Man is falsely associated with bombings [which have incited irrational feelings of anger and ethnocentricity.]  - Associating with people on drugs and chemically unstable, man's fellow hustlers/pushers are violent and reckless.  - Man's friends kill him from bad information provided by salem witch-hunters.   Ergo, it is not unreasonable to presume that prejudice, a broken society and bigotry contributed to this death.  So what the fuck is your problem RangerRiley? Go eat your own troll snot on a bleached blog you ignorant fuck.             Thu, 04/25/2013 - 11:47 |      RangerRiley             I love that you spent all that time replying to me.

Well, it's unreasonable to dismiss one groups prejudices through asserting your own prejudice as reasonable. Prejudice is always reasonable to the person holding it and unreasonable to the guy on the receiving end.

Thu, 04/25/2013 - 11:16 |      maximin thrax             Yes, let's demonstrate that it's wrong to rush to judgement by rushing to judgement.  If we weren't so darned Islamophobic as a nation, this guy might not have dissappeared a month before we started looking to scapegoat guys who look like him. Or something.  Now I got it! It behoves people who have knowlegde of pending terrorist attacks or who are actually part of the plotting of such attacks to take full advantage of that knowledge by making one's self scarce before said attacks bring the threat of Americans singling you out for punishment, not for what you actually did but for their assumption of your guilt based on how you look. Which is, of course, the greater evil, or something.  I'll have to work on it some more. Seriously, condolences to the family on this tragic outcome. I hope it was some kind of bizzarre accident that killed this guy and not one of our many home-grown terrorists, AKA gangstas in da hood.            Thu, 04/25/2013 - 11:34 |      smacker              The dates you quote are known facts mentioned in the ZH article. Do they help in determining anything?

Perhaps it is also time to remember the whole "innocent until proven guilty" saying, as meaningless as it may be in our day and age."  ------------------------------------------  So, how do drone attacks by the government fit into that fine moral standard you have there? Have the people executed in those attacks been put on trial, have they been found guilty, was death an appropriate punishment?              Thu, 04/25/2013 - 10:57 |      Tyler Durden             All very appropriate questions.

I see too much apathy, and I say it's gonna be the end of us.  The whole "must be first, correct or otherwise" attitude from the Internet era is very damaging to the principle of identifying and reporting facts and truth. Sad days.

Thu, 04/25/2013 - 11:10 |      Sudden Debt             it different....  the drone killed those people. It wasn't a real person who did it.  And the pilots are in America and the drones where not in the same timezone.  It's like cheating on you wife when she is in another timezone... than it's not cheating.  same thing.  you clearly don't understand.             Thu, 04/25/2013 - 11:30 |      mess nonster             I agree 100%. It's like a live video sex chat on-line with a hooker who lives 2000 miles away from you. Why it isn't even sex! Cheating, what cheating? Besides, getting blow-jobs isn't cheating, not even real-live blow jobs, where a real chick is doing the action on your real penis. Only actual penetration is cheatinig, and then it's only cheating if the penetration is done with loving intent- if it's just sex with hookers or one night stands it isn't cheating, no sirree, nope!

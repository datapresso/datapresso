We recently discovered a spam campaign that takes advantage of the media buzz and social outrage about the event. The spammed mail sports the subject '2 explosions at Boston Marathon' sports a single hyperlink in its body.  Should the recipient click the link supplied in the spammed email, it will redirect into a page featuring embedded videos of the event. During the redirection, it will connect to a malicious URL to automatically download malicious files and then execute them.  The downloaded malware hides path directories on any USB drives attached to the affected system and replaces them with an .LNK file. This file then executes the downloaded malware whenever the user tries to open a particular folder or path.  Users are once again reminded to always be vigilant and to anticipate threats like these whenever news events break out.  The spammed mails and the malware payloads are already detected and blocked by Trend Micro. Further analysis of the first spam campaign mentioned in this blog post has indicated that while it uses exploits, it does not specifically use the Blackhole Exploit Kit.       	    TMASE Engine:  7.0  TMASE Pattern:  9804      Analysis By: Jude Israel Bordallo                                   	       	 		 			 About Trend Micro 			 Sign In 				 					 Home Users My Account 					 Security Services Portal 				 			 			 Shop 				 					 Shop for Home 					 New Products 					 Renewals 					 Shop for Business 					 Find a Reseller 					 Contact Sales 				 			 			 Support 				 					 Home &amp; Home Office 					 Small &amp; Medium Business 					 Enterprise 					 Threat Information 				 			 			 Australia, New Zealand [+] 				 					 North America 					 Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) 					 US 					 France 					 Canada 					 Germany, Austria, Switzerland 					 Asia Pacific (APAC) 					 Italy 					 Taiwan 					 Russia, CIS Countries 					 Japan 					 Spain 					 China 					 UK, Ireland 					 Hong Kong 					 Europe, Middle East, Africa, other 					 India 					 Latin America 					 Korea 					 Brazil 					 Malaysia 					 Mexico 					 Singapore 					 Latin America, other 					 Thailand 					  					 Vietnam 					  					 Asia Pacific, other 					  				 			 		 		 			 				 				 Search: 				 				 				 			 		 	 	 		 	                 		 Home &amp; Home Office 			 				 Home &amp; Home Office Overview 				 Products 				 Download Center 				 Trial Downloads 				 Support 				 Buy Online 			 		 		 Small Business 			 				 5-100 computers 				 Small Business Overview 				 Products 				 Download Center 				 Trial Downloads 				 Support 				 Find a Reseller 			 		 		 Medium Business 			 				 100-1000 computers 				 Medium Business Overview 				 Products 				 Solutions 				 Download Center 				 Trial Downloads 				 Support 				 Find a Reseller 			 		 		 Enterprise 			 				 1000+ computers 				 Enterprise Overview 				 Products 				 Download Center 				 Trial Downloads 				 Support 				 Find a Reseller 			 		 		 Service Providers 			 				 Service Providers 				 Security Solutions 				 Infrastructure Solutions 				 Endpoint Solutions 				 Customer Stories 			 		 		 Partners 			 				 Channel Solutions Partners 				 Technology Solution Partners 				 Find a Reseller 				 Affinity Program 			 		 	                    	            Copyright (c) 1989-2011 Trend Micro Incorporated.

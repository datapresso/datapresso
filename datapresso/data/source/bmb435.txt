Campbell was standing near the finish line, cheering on runners with her friend Karen Rand, when the first explosion occurred. Authorities initially reported Campbell had survived, but later realized their mistake. Rand was seriously injured and lost her left leg due to her injuries.  Members of Maine's harness racing industry, including the folks at Scarborough Downs, raised roughly $3,000 to benefit the One Fund Boston, a charity formed in the aftermath to aid those injured and killed in the attack.

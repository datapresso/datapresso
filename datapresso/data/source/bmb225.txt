The man who found the Boston Marathon bombing suspect hiding in his boat in his backyard says he's no hero and wants the attention he's drawn to "fade away."   David Henneberry tells The Boston Globe (http://b.globe.com/16amTa1 ) he wants to set the record straight.   Media have reported the 66-year-old retiree went to investigate after seeing blood on his boat in his Watertown backyard.   But he says the truth is he never would have approached the boat had he seen blood. Instead, he noticed some padding used to protect the hull of the 24-foot vessel had fallen to the ground, so he went to fix it.   Only when he lifted the wrap covering the boat did he notice blood and saw Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (joh-HAHR' tsahr-NEYE'-ehv). Henneberry then ran inside and called 911.

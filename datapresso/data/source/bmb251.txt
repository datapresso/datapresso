And as with the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden , there&#8217;s a public fascination with the details and procedures of what went down.  The latest is the video footage taken by a Massachusetts State Police helicopter of the careful way in which police approached the boat. Obviously, they were cautious, no doubt because they had engaged in a pretty intense firefight with the suspect.  What you see in the video below, which was released today, is thermal imagery showing Tsarnaev&#8217;s warm body plainly visible beneath the boat cover. In the minutes leading up to the capture you could plainly hear, on police scanner traffic , someone saying whether or not he was moving, and see his position in the front or the middle or rear of the boat as he moved around a little. Later, you see a police vehicle moving in and using a robotic arm of some kind to tear away the cover.    And if you haven&#8217;t seen this yet, it bears mentioning: It&#8217;s some amateur video, taken from a neighboring home, of the gunfight that had occurred outside the boat just as Tsarnaev was discovered. (Be advised: There&#8217;s some NSFW language as it goes down.)    Finally, here are five still photos, released earlier by the Massachusetts State Police, taken from the video footage above.

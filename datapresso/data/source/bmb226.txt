Massachusetts State Police tactical photographer Sgt. Sean Murphy was temporarily suspended and then placed on restricted duty for a time after giving the photos to Boston Magazine, which he said he did to counter the &#8220;fluffed and buffed&#8221; image of Tsarnaev on the cover of Rolling Stone.  Boston Magazine on Tuesday published more of Murphy&#8217;s photographs from the days that gripped the city and the nation in April:  Photo credit: Sean Murphy/Boston Magazine  Photo credit: Sean Murphy/Boston Magazine  Photo credit: Sean Murphy/Boston Magazine  Photo credit: Sean Murphy/Boston Magazine  Photo credit: Sean Murphy/Boston Magazine  Photo credit: Sean Murphy/Boston Magazine  See all the photos at Boston Magazine .  &#8211;  Other must read stories: CVS won&#8217;t carry new &#8216;Rolling Stone&#8217; with Boston Bomber on cover NY Times: Outrage over Rolling Stone cover &#8216;heat-wave induced&#8217; Rolling Stone Tsarnaev cover sells big Former FCC official: Rolling Stone boycott &#8216;reminiscent of Nazi book-burning&#8217; Rolling Stone&#8217;s Boston Bomber cover was a commercial success, for better or worse  		 				 			 Share this article 		 		 Did you know you can listen to Glenn Beck, Pat &amp; Stu, Jay Severin, Doc Thompson, Buck Sexton and more on TheBlaze Radio while you read the news?  Click here to listen   				      Back to TheBlaze &raquo; 				   	 Sign In To Post Comments!

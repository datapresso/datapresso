Ailina Tsarnaeva (tsahr-NEYE'-ehv-uh) was in South Boston court Wednesday to ask a judge to remove a warrant issued after she failed to appear on a charge of misleading police. Prosecutors say the 23-year-old Tsarnaeva picked up a person who passed counterfeit money at the South Bay Mall in Boston in 2010 but was uncooperative when questioned about it. Tsarnaeva's lawyer said she is now living in New Jersey and has agreed to check in with the Massachusetts probation office every week. Her brother is charged in the April 15 bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260.

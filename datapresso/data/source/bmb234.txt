Steve King (R-Iowa). &quot;Those two other cases, the individuals had their cases closed. So, he was one or two person [sic] away.&quot;  When King asked Mueller if it was reasonable to say that the Russian letter &quot;refocused&quot; the FBI on Tsarnaev, Mueller replied, &quot;Absolutely.&quot;  Mueller did not elaborate on the nature of the prior investigations where Tsarnaev&#39;s name had arisen. However, an FBI official told POLITICO they were not related to terrorism. The official, who asked not to be named, also said the agent who conducted an &quot;assessment&quot; of Tsarnaev in response to the Russian warning in 2011 found the previous references and was aware of them.  Former House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King (R-N.Y.) said he believes the prior mentions of Tsarnaev in FBI files should have resulted in greater scrutiny of the Russian-born U.S. resident who allegedly went on to carry out the April 15, 2013 bombing that killed three and an ensuing crime spree that left a police officer dead.  ( PHOTOS: Boston Marathon bombings suspects )  Tamerlan was eventually killed in a shootout with police a few miles away from the bombing scene. His brother, Dzhokhar, survived the shootout. He has been charged with the bombings and is in a federal prison hospital near Boston.  &quot;What are the chances of the Russians reporting on someone who&#39;s pretty obscure and the FBI checks him out and finds out his name has come up twice before?&quot; asked Peter King. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it have warranted keeping the investigation open longer or at least going to the Boston police and warning them?&quot;  At Thursday&#39;s hearing, Mueller defended that inquiry as thorough, even though it resulted in no further action.  &quot;I do believe that when we got the lead on Tamerlan from the Russians, that the agent did an excellent job in investigating, utilizing the tools that are available to him in that kind of investigation,&quot; the FBI chief said. &quot;He did all the records checks. He went out to the interview persons at the college where Tamerlan was there for a period of time, ultimately interviewed the parents, interviewed Tamerlan himself, sent the information back to Russia. And on three separate occasions we asked the Russians for additional information that might give us indications or evidence that he was a terrorist.&quot;  Other U.S. officials have said the Russians did not respond to those requests for more information.  Mueller suggested that there simply wasn&#39;t enough of a legal basis to do anything else at that juncture. &quot;At that point in time, I do not know that there was much else that could be done within the statutes, within the Constitution, to further investigate him,&quot; the FBI director said.  Peter King said local police could have visited Tsarnaev&#39;s mosque, for example, something he said FBI guidelines would not have permitted. &quot;They never went to the mosque, never went to the imam....I just find it of some concern there were two references to [Tsarnaev] before and they still didn&#39;t think it merited keeping the investigation open,&quot; the New York Republican told POLITICO Friday.  Steve King, who asked Mueller about the FBI&#39;s full history of knowledge of Tsarnaev, said it&#39;s important to establish how much of the early information on Tsarnaev came from Russia and how much was produced by the U.S. government.  &quot;I thought it was important to ask: &#39;Who first flagged you?&hellip;How did he first come to our attention?&quot; Steve King told POLITICO Saturday. &quot;The Russians seemed to know more about Tamerlan than we did, including that he had traveled to Utah to compete in the Golden Gloves.&quot;  The Iowa Republican was among half a dozen lawmakers who traveled to Russia earlier this month to try to piece together what happened between the Russian intelligence services and the U.S. in connection with the Boston bombing suspects.  Steve King said his most urgent concern is that Chechens in the U.S. may be winning asylum without anyone in the U.S. government checking with Russia about whether the individuals have terrorist ties. &quot;My concern is how many terrorists are coming into the United States and are receiving asylum?...What&#39;s the total number of others who might have come in under that same window?&quot; the congressman asked.   			 				 					Read more about: 												 Terrorism , 							 Russia , 							 FBI , 							 Peter King , 							 Steve King , 							 Robert Mueller , 							 House Judiciary Committee , 							 Boston Marathon , 							 Chechnya , 							 Boston Bombing 				 			 					 				 			 																				 					 					 					 				 								 							 						 				 			 		 										 			 				  		   		  		  		  					 		 														 									 Please see the Comments FAQ if you have any additional questions or email your thoughts to commentsfeedback@politico.com 									 																											 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. 									 comments powered by Disqus 								 								 	 		 					 								  					 							 													 								 Josh Gerstein 															 							 							 	 								  									 									 	 										 	 Search Josh Gerstein 										 	 										 										 											 Search 										 										 																				 										 										 								  								 								 																		 Josh Gerstein Email: jgerstein@politico.com Twitter: joshgerstein 								 							 												 													 															 									 Most Popular Posts 								 								 				     								 													     	 		      	 1 		        Supreme Court issues new protest ban 		        06/13/2013 6:52 PM 		       																												     	 		      	 2 		        FBI knew earlier of Boston bombing suspect 		        06/15/2013 10:21 AM 		       																												     	 		      	 3 		        Official: 13 briefings for Hill on call-tracking legal provision 		        06/08/2013 12:35 PM 		       																												     	 		      	 4 		        Merkley passed up surveillance briefing 		        06/12/2013 11:21 PM 		       																												     	 		      	 5 		        ACLU files lawsuit over NSA call tracking 		        06/11/2013 4:27 PM 		       																												 						     														 												 									 	 						 Categories 					 					 						 														 																	 Aipac 																	 Bush Administration 																	 Campaign Finance 																	 Classified Information 																	 Drones 																	 Drugs 																	 Election Law 																	 Espionage 																	 Ethics 																	 FACA 																	 First Amendment 																	 FISA 																	 FOIA 																	 Immigration 															 							 																	 Inspectors General 																	 Intelligence 																	 Interrogations 																	 Leaks 																	 Miscellaneous 																	 Obama Administration 																	 Patriot Act 																	 Privacy 																	 Supreme Court 																	 Terrorism 																	 Terrorism Financing 																	 Transparency 																	 Warrantless Wiretapping 															 						 					 					 						 														 																	 Campaign Finance 																	 Classified Information 																	 Drones 																	 Drugs 																	 Election Law 																	 Ethics 																	 FACA 																	 First Amendment 																	 FOIA 																	 Immigration 															 							 																	 Inspectors General 																	 Intelligence 																	 Leaks 																	 Miscellaneous 																	 Obama Administration 																	 Privacy 																	 Supreme Court 																	 Terrorism 																	 Transparency 																	 Warrantless Wiretapping 															 							 Show all 						 					 										 											 									   	 			    	 Popular on POLITICO 			     			     			    	 			       			        Stories/Blogs 			        Videos 			        Photo Galleries 			       			       			       			         			        	 Trending Now 			          Last 24 Hours 			          Last 7 Days 			         			               			         			 			 Updated: 6/15/13 5:42 PM EDT 		 												 				 								 							   1 							   Sarah Palin: D.C. a 'hot mess' 					 		 															 							   2 							   Experts: NSA lawsuits could break new legal ground 					 		 															 							   3 							   Evangelicals to GOP: Don't betray us on abortion 					 		 															 							   4 							   Obamacare?

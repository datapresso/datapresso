Ailina Tsarnaeva was in South Boston court Wednesday to ask a judge to remove a warrant issued after she failed to appear on a charge of misleading police.  Prosecutors say the 22-year-old woman picked up a person who passed counterfeit money at the South Bay Mall in Boston in 2010 but was uncooperative when questioned about it.    Stoned-faced: Ailina Tsarnaeva, sister of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, appeared in South Boston District Court in connection to a counterfeiting case            Young mother: Tsarnaeva's lawyer argued that she should be released without bail because she is destitute and has to take care of a young child, with a second one on the way  Tsarnaeva's lawyer said she is now living in New Jersey and has agreed to check in with the Massachusetts probation office every week.  In return, Judge Michael Bolden waived her next scheduled court appearance for a pre-trial conference.  Dressed in a double-breasted grey raincoat and a leopard-print scarf on her head, Ailina sought to shield her face from the glare of news cameras as she was hustled by her lawyer into the back of a waiting SUV and whisked away.  Her brother Dzhokhar has been charged in the April 15 bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260. The siblings&#8217; older brother, Tamerlan, was killed just days after the attack in a gun battle with police.     Seeking privacy: Ailina attempted to shield her face from the news cameras outside the courtroom before jumping into a waiting SUV   Assistant Suffolk District Attorney William Champlin IV asked the judge to order Tsranaeva held on $1,500 cash bail, pointing out that she failed to appear for a court hearing in February 2011 and now lives out of state.  However, defense attorney George Gormley argued that his client is insolvent and has 1-year-old child, with another baby on the way.  'The bail of $1,500 might as well be $15,000,' he said in court Wednesday, according to the Boston Herald.  The counterfeit case involving the 22-year-old Ailina Tsranaev stems from an April 16, 2010, incident in which fake cash was used to pay for a meal at Applebee&#8217;s Restaurant in Dorchester.

When police approached her for help in finding them, the 22-year-old withheld information about her friends, telling officers that 'she did not want to be a snitch.'  Just weeks after the Boston Marathon bombing, federal agents executed a search warrant at Ailina&#8217;s home in West New York, New Jersey, where she lived at the time with her husband and baby, seizing computers and cell phones.           Troubled family: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, was captured and charged in connection to the deadly April 15 marathon bombing; Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, was killed in a police gunfight   When questioned about her brothers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, Tsarnaeva told officials that she had not been in contact with them for years, the station WCVB reported.  &#8216;He was a great person,&#8217; Ailina said of Tamerlan. &#8216;I thought I knew him. I never would have expected that from him.  &#8216;He is a kind and loving man. The cops took his life away just the same way he took others' lives away, if that's even true. At the end of the day, no one knows the truth.&#8217;     Read more:   Bombing suspect's sister charged in counterfeit bill case  Tsarnaev¿s sister released without bail | Boston Herald      Share or comment on this article                         15 shares                 MOST WATCHED NEWS VIDEOS   Previous  1  2  3  Next        Graphic: News report shows horrific effects of new drug...

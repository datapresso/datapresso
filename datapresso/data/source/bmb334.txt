We’re going to be protecting them around the clock just to make sure that nothing happens to them.”  The mayor went to visit Alina after her brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was captured late Friday night, according to CBS New York. “Her feeling is she feels sad about the whole situation. She feels bad about what happened, she says she’s not involved in anything,” Roque said “It was so depressing, so sad. They were sobbing. I mean, they were broken-hearted.” Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older brother aged 26, was killed in a shootout with police early Friday morning, reported CBS New York.  Mayor Roque’s had a message for anyone trying to seek revenge with the Tsarneav family, “Don’t you dare. And if you were to come in and harass them or in any way molest them, we will arrest [you],” reported CBS New York.

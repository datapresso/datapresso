She was also a spectator at the Boston Marathon back in April; she stood just fifteen feet from where the first bomb went off.  Yanni looked down and saw a bone sticking out of her leg. Shrapnel had tore through her fibula and ripped apart the surrounding muscles. Yanni underwent three surgeries and was on crutches for a month. She still has a large scar on her left shin that reminds her of that fateful day in April that killed three and injured more than 200 others.  Yanni says that she wasn&#39;t going to let terrorists destroy her dream.  &#39;I don&#39;t care if I have to walk, crawl or piggyback,&#39; she told the Boston Herald . &#39;I&#39;m not letting these fools take my first marathon away from me.&#39;  She ran in Chicago to honor her father&#39;s memory and to raise money to help fight cancer. He died in September.  Yanni finished the race in five hours and forty-four minutes, which beats her goal of six hours.  I shouldn&#39;t be running right now. But I just finished a marathon, so if you set your mind to it, it&#39;s totally possible," Yanni told FOXSports .              Follow @FOX29philly           Local News More&gt;&gt;    9-Year-Old Invents App  9-Year-Old Invents App  Updated: Thursday, October 17 2013 11:24 PM EDT 2013-10-18 03:24:35 GMT  SACRAMENTO, CALIFONIA- This past week you could find Nicolas Come at the Tenth Annual Sarta Clean Air Showcase in California, showing the launch of his new app "Nicolas&#39;s Garden".

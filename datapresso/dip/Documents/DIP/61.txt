ANZALDUAS, Texas — U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Field Operations (OFO) officers at the Anzalduas International Bridge arrested a woman from Edinburg, Texas and a woman from Mission, Tx with cocaine valued at over $2 million in two separate incidents.

“Our officers made two outstanding seizures of  hard narcotics at the Anzalduas Bridge by utilizing all available resources,” said Efrain Solis Jr., Port Director, Hidalgo/Pharr/Anzalduas. “It all starts with quality referrals and our officers’ excellent commitment and persistence to discover the contraband thus keeping it out of our communities.”

On Thursday, September 6, 2012 in the early morning hours a black 2002 Dodge Stratus driven by a 22-year-old female United States citizen from Edinburg arrived at the Anzalduas-Reynosa International Bridge.  The lone female presented her U.S. birth certificate and a CBP officer referred her and the vehicle to secondary for further inspection.  In secondary officers discovered 16 packages of alleged cocaine weighing approximately 17.58 kilograms (38.75 pounds) which were hidden within the vehicle. 

On Friday, September 7, 2012 also in the early morning a gold 2004 Chrysler Sebring arrived at the Anzalduas International Bridge.  The driver, a 20-year-old female United States citizen from Mission presented her U.S. passport card to the CBP officer and was referred to secondary for a more thorough inspection. In secondary officers discovered 14 packages weighing approximately 15.22 kilograms (33.55 pounds) of alleged cocaine which were hidden within the vehicle. CBP seized the narcotics in both incidents which have a combined estimated street value of $2,314,000 and both vehicles as well.

The two adult female travelers were released to the custody of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) for further investigation.

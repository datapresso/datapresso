TSA creating sense of ‘paranoia’

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is attempting to create a sense of “paranoia” and fear in the U.S. by placing new scanners at train stations, bus stations, subways and places of mass transit, says Linh Dinh, a political analyst and writer in Philadelphia.
 
“The real reason [for deploying scanners] is to cause paranoia and to harass American citizens into being obedient,” Dinh said in a phone interview on Saturday.
 
More documents uncovered under the Freedom of Information Act have revealed that in the year prior to rolling out radiation body scanners in airports, the TSA was drawing up long term plans to deploy scanners at “ferry terminals, railway, and mass transit stations” as well as unspecified “other locations”.
 
The documents, dating from 2008 were released to engineer Jon Corbett who made headlines last year by infamously posted a video of himself demonstrating how the body scanners can easily be bypassed.
 
The feds have also purchased hundreds of x-ray scanners mounted in vans that are being used to randomly scan vehicles, passengers and homes in complete violation of the 4th amendment and with wanton disregard for any health consequences.

Nogales, Arizona - A Tucson woman was arrested Wednesday morning for attempting to smuggle an estimated $281,000 worth of narcotics into the U.S..

Customs and Border Protection officers referred Adriana Cantu Lopez, 39, for inspection of her Chevrolet truck when she attempted to enter the U.S. through the Dennis DeConcini Port. Officers discovered nearly 31 pounds of cocaine concealed in a compartment within the firewall.

Lopez was arrested and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations. The drugs and vehicle were seized.

Individuals arrested may be charged by complaint, the method by which a person is charged with criminal activity, which raises no inference of guilt. An individual is presumed innocent unless and until competent evidence is presented to a jury that establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

CBP's Office of Field Operations is the primary organization within Homeland Security tasked with an anti-terrorism mission at our nation’s ports.

San Luis, Arizona - Two pedestrians were arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in separate incidents during Labor Day weekend for attempting to smuggle methamphetamine into the United States.

On August 31, 25-year-old Mario Alberto Salgado Trejo was arrested after officers found 1.2 pounds of methamphetamine, valued at more than $18,000, taped to his thighs.

On September 1, a 17-year-old male was apprehended after officers, assisted by a narcotics detection canine, found close to two pounds of meth, worth $23,870, taped to the man’s thighs.

In each incident, the drugs were processed for seizure and the two men were turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcements’ Homeland Security Investigations.

Individuals arrested may be charged by complaint, the method by which a person is charged with criminal activity, which raises no inference of guilt. An individual is presumed innocent unless and until competent evidence is presented to a jury that establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Office of Field Operations is the primary organization within Customs and Border Protection tasked with an anti-terrorism mission at our nation’s ports. CBP officers screen all people, vehicles and goods entering the United States while facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel. Their mission also includes carrying out border-related duties, including narcotics interdiction, enforcing immigration and trade laws, and protecting the nation's food supply and agriculture industry from pests and diseases.

Animal abuse cases on Long Island
A Shirley man was arrested Sunday night, charged with animal cruelty, after authorities learned he was keeping nearly two-dozen pit bulls in "deplorable conditions" inside and outside of his home, the Suffolk SPCA said.
"The conditions these dogs were forced to endure were horrible," Suffolk County Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Chief Roy Gross said. In all, 20 dogs were seized, he said.
Edward Erdman, 38, of Rowlinson Drive, was charged with animal cruelty for failure to provide proper sustenance, Gross said, adding that an SPCA investigation remains under way.
Suffolk County police said a 911 caller reported pit bulls barking -- and fighting each other -- in the backyard of the home shortly before 3 p.m.
Gross said the dogs were living in their own excrement with no food or water present. He said some of the dogs "looked emaciated."
They were brought to the Brookhaven animal shelter.

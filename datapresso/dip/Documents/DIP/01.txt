TRIPOLI, Lebanon â€” Lebanese army intelligence services on Sunday arrested a group accused of detaining Syrian opposition figures in northern Lebanon and handing them over to Damascus, a security official said.
"Members of a network operating between (the port city of) Tripoli and Akkar (bordering Syria) and accused of planning and carrying out the kidnapping of Syrian opposition figures and delivering them to the regime" were arrested, he told AFP.
The official, who declined to be named, said "at least one Syrian kidnapped by the network has been released in the Akkar region," and later added that three Lebanese suspects were detained.
Anti-Damascus figures in Lebanon have often accused the leadership in neighbouring Syria of ordering such actions against its opponents since the March 2011 outbreak of the anti-regime uprising there.

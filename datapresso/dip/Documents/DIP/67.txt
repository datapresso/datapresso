— A United Express plane made an emergency landing at Johnstown’s airport Sunday after the pilot reported smelling smoke in the cockpit.

The De Havilland 8 commuter plane en route from Washington’s Dulles International Airport to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport came into the Richland Township airport without incident, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said.

All 37 passengers were evacuated, township fire Chief Todd Shaffer said.

The turboprop aircraft was parked overnight at the John Murtha Johns­town-Cambria County Airport. United maintenance crews were expected to be at the airport today to inspect the plane, MTT Aviation Services General Manager William Hunt said.

When the pilot reported smoke in the cockpit, air traffic controllers diverted the flight to Johnstown. Emergency crews from the airport and Richland Township responded and met the plane on the airfield.

“The pilot smelled smoke,” Shaffer said. “He never really had smoke in the cockpit.”

Fire crews examined the aircraft and found nothing burning, he said.

United made arrangements to get the passengers on their way to Cleveland, Hunt said.September 10, 2012

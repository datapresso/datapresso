Cell phone jamming flap 

SAN FRANCISCO -- A decision by San Francisco Bay Area transit officials to cut off cell phone service at some of its stations to thwart a planned protest drew an angry response Saturday from one transit board member who said she was shocked that officials acted as "this type of censor."

Bay Area Rapid Transit officials have said they shut down power Thursday evening to cellular towers for stations stretching from downtown to San Francisco's airport after learning protesters planned to use mobile devices to coordinate its demonstration.

"I'm just shocked that they didn't think about the implications of this," said Lynette Sweet, who serves on BART board.

BART Deputy Police Chief Benson Fairow on Friday told KTVU-TV that the agency decided to turn off underground cell service because it received reports that a rowdy group that had protested in July had similar plans.

Rapper linked to prank 

LOS ANGELES -- A rapper could face criminal charges after a tweet from his account incited a telephone flash mob that overwhelmed the emergency phone system at one of busiest stations of the Los Angeles County sheriff's department, the agency said Saturday.

The sheriff's department alleges that The Game tweeted the Compton station's phone number Friday and told his 580,000 followers to call the number if they wanted an internship.

The Game's real name is Charles Louboutin, who grew up in Compton.

Bomb-hoax indictment 

MIAMI -- A California man suspected of causing a bomb hoax at a downtown Miami building that houses the Israeli and German consulates has been indicted by a federal grand jury.

Federal prosecutors said Friday that William Rolland, 52, of Auburn, Calif., has been charged with one count of conveying a false bomb threat.

Investigators said that on July 25, Mr. Rolland walked into a lobby of an office building on North Biscayne Boulevard and began talking loudly on a cell phone while videotaping the lobby with a camera. That led to a confrontation with a security guard, triggering the threat, according to an FBI affidavit.

Diamond set for auction 

CINCINNATI -- A large yellow diamond -- known as the "Golden Eye" -- seized in a federal drug and money-laundering investigation in northeast Ohio is going on the auction block with the minimum starting bid set at $900,000.

The 43.51-carat diamond belonged to Alliance businessman Paul Monea, who was convicted of money laundering and conspiracy.

Prosecutors said he tried to sell to an undercover FBI agent the diamond and an estate in Trumbull County, north of Youngstown, once owned by boxer Mike Tyson, all for $19.5 million and a boat.

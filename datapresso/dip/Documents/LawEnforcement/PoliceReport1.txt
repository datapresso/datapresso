On Monday November 14, 2005 at 07:37 AM I was dispatched to Fuel Mart on a drive off theft of gas. Upon arrival I spoke to the complainant, (Clerk) Rochelle Walls and she stated the Suspect pumped 11.48 gallons of premium gas from pump # 1. Rochelle walked to the door to watch him and that's when he laid the pump on the ground and took off north bound on Phil St. She asked her other employee if it was ok to follow him and she stated yes.  She followed him in her vehicle and caught up to him on Lemoyne at Heuston Rd. She was able to write down the license plate of DDR-1955 and stated it was a Silver Mazda 4-door with tinted windows. Premium gas is $3.049 a gallons totaling $35.01 and they did wish to file charges.  Rochelle stated the suspect was a white male in his 20's, approximately 507, thin build with brown hair and had facial hair. Sgt. Repeta met us at the Fuel Mart and pulled up the owner of the vehicles BMV photo and Rochelle stated that was the suspect.  I then went on station and typed up charges for petty theft NCO 642-02 M-1 release on summons through Northwood Mayor Court.  The suspect is Attila Des Huns of 1212 Filter Rd. Leixlip, Ohio 43619, and the plate came back on a 1997 Mazda 4-door to the same.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

         Directors  who are  employees of the Company do not receive  additional
compensation   for  their  services  as  directors  of  the  Company.   However,
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors receive an annual cash retainer of
$5,000 and $1,250 for  attendance  at each  meeting of the Board of Directors or
any committee thereof.

         In addition,  nonemployee  directors  participate in the Company's 1995
Director  Option Plan (the "Director  Plan").  The Director Plan was approved by
the Board in October 1995 and was ratified by  stockholders in November 1995, at
which time a total of 75,000  shares of Common Stock were  reserved for issuance
thereunder. As of March 5, 1999, there were 56,000 options outstanding under the
Director Plan.  The Director Plan became  effective on the date of the Company's
initial public  offering on November 15, 1995, and is currently  administered by
the Board of Directors.  Under the Director Plan, each  nonemployee  director is
automatically  granted a  non-qualified  option to purchase 10,000 shares on the
date upon which such person first becomes a director (the "Initial Option") with
an exercise  price equal to the fair market value of the Company's  Common Stock
as of the date of grant. Thereafter,  each nonemployee director is automatically
granted an option to purchase 2,000 shares of Common Stock on December 1 of each
year,  except in the year the Director Plan was adopted  ("Subsequent  Option"),
provided  he or she has served as a director  for at least six months as of such
date.

         Options granted under the Director Plan have a term of ten years unless
terminated  sooner upon  termination of the  optionee's  status as a director or
otherwise  pursuant to the Director Plan.  Such options are  transferable by the
optionee only in certain  limited  circumstances  and each option is exercisable
during  the  lifetime  of the  director  only by such  director  or a  permitted
transferee.  Initial  Options  granted under the Director Plan vest as to 20% of
the  shares  on the  first  anniversary  date of grant  and as to the  remaining
shares, ratably each month over the ensuing four years. Subsequent Options begin
to vest on the fourth  anniversary  of the date of grant and vest  ratably  each
month over the next 12 month  period.  The  Director  Plan is  designed  to work
automatically, without administration;  however, to the extent administration is
necessary,  the Director  Plan has been  structured  so that options  granted to
nonemployee  directors who administer the Company's other employee benefit plans
shall qualify as  transactions  exempt from Section 16(b) of the  Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Exchange  Act"),  pursuant to Rule 16b-3
promulgated thereunder.

REQUIRED VOTE

         The five nominees  receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of
the shares  present or  represented  and  entitled to be voted for them shall be
elected  as  directors,  whether  or not such  affirmative  votes  constitute  a
majority of the shares voted.  Votes  withheld from any director are counted for
purposes of determining  the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction
of business, but they have no legal effect under Delaware law.

           MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE NOMINEES LISTED ABOVE.

                                 PROPOSAL NO. 2

           RATIFICATION OF AND APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S
                                 1992 STOCK PLAN

         The  Company's  Board of Directors  and  stockholders  have  previously
adopted and approved the Company's 1992 Stock Plan. A total of 2,288,000  shares
of Common Stock are  presently  reserved for issuance  under the Stock Plan.  In
February 1999,  the Board of Directors  approved an amendment to the Stock Plan,
subject to stockholder  approval,  to increase the shares  reserved for issuance
thereunder by 600,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares issuable under
the Stock Plan to 2,888,000. In addition, the Board approved an amendment to add
an automatic  replenishment  feature to the Stock Plan which would  increase the
number of shares  issuable under the Stock Plan on December 31 of 1999, 2000 and
2001 the lesser of (i) 500,000,  (ii) 3% of the outstanding  Common Stock on the
date  of  increase  or  (iii) a  lesser  amount  determined  by the  Board  (the
"Evergreen  Provision").  As of March 5, 1999,  47,500 shares were available for
future issuance under the Stock Plan. The Company also has a Nonstatutory  Stock
Plan which provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options to non-executive
officer  employees.  As of March 5, 1999, 8,000 shares were available for future
issuance under the Nonstatutory Stock Plan.

At the Annual  Meeting,  the  Stockholders  are being  requested to consider and
approve the  proposed  amendments  to the Stock Plan to  increase  the number of
shares of Common  Stock  reserved  for issuance  thereunder  by 600,000  shares,
bringing the total number of shares  issuable  under the Stock Plan to 2,888,000
and to approve the addition of the  Evergreen  Provision to the Stock Plan.  The
Board  believes  that the  amendments  will enable the  Company to continue  its
policy of widespread employee stock ownership as a means to motivate high levels
of  performance  and to recognize  key employee  accomplishments.  At the Annual
Meeting,  the Stockholders will also be asked to ratify and approve the material
terms  of  the  1992  Stock  Plan,  including,  without  limitation,  the  share
limitations  described  below with  respect to Section  162 (m) of the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

SUMMARY OF THE ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. 1992 STOCK PLAN

         GENERAL.  The  purpose  of the Plan is to  attract  and retain the best
available  personnel  for  positions  of  substantial  responsibility  with  the
Company, to provide additional incentive to the employees and consultants of the
Company and to promote the success of the  Company.  Options and stock  purchase
rights  may be granted  under the Plan.  Options  granted  under the Plan may be
either  "incentive  stock  options",  as defined in Section 422 of the  Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or nonstatutory stock options.

         ADMINISTRATION.  The Plan may generally be  administered  by the Board 
or a Committee  appointed by the Board (as  applicable, the "Administrator").  
The Administrator may make any determinations deemed necessary or advisable for 
the Plan.

         ELIGIBILITY.  Nonstatutory  stock options and stock purchase rights may
be granted  under the Plan to employees and  consultants  of the Company and any
parent or subsidiary of the Company. Incentive stock options may be granted only
to employees.  The Administrator,  in its discretion,  selects the employees and
consultants to whom options and stock purchase  rights may be granted,  the time
or times at which such options and stock purchase  rights shall be granted,  and
the exercise price and number of shares subject to each such grant.

         LIMITATIONS.   Section   162(m)  of  the  Code  places  limits  on  the
deductibility  for federal income tax purposes of  compensation  paid to certain
executive officers of the Company. In order to preserve the Company's ability to
deduct the compensation income associated with options and stock purchase rights


                                      -5-

granted to such persons,  the Plan provides that no employee may be granted,  in
any fiscal year of the Company,  options and stock  purchase  rights to purchase
more than 150,000 shares of Common Stock.  Notwithstanding this limit,  however,
in connection with such individual's  initial employment with the Company, he or
she may be  granted  options  or stock  purchase  rights  to  purchase  up to an
additional 150,000 shares of Common Stock.

         TERMS AND  CONDITIONS  OF OPTIONS.  Each option is evidenced by a stock
option  agreement  between the Company and the  optionee,  and is subject to the
following terms and conditions:

         (a) EXERCISE PRICE. The Administrator  determines the exercise price of
options at the time the options are granted.  The exercise price of an incentive
stock  option may not be less than 100% of the fair  market  value of the Common
Stock on the date such option is granted; provided,  however, the exercise price
of an incentive  stock option granted to a 10%  shareholder may not be less than
110% of the fair  market  value of the Common  Stock on the date such  option is
granted.  The fair market value of the Common Stock is generally determined with
reference  to the closing sale price for the Common Stock (or the closing bid if
no sales were reported) on the date the option is granted.

         (b)  EXERCISE  OF  OPTION;  FORM OF  CONSIDERATION.  The  Administrator
determines  when  options  become  exercisable,   and  may  in  its  discretion,
accelerate  the  vesting of any  outstanding  option.  The means of payment  for
shares issued upon exercise of an option is specified in each option  agreement.
The Plan  permits  payment to be made by cash,  check,  promissory  note,  other
shares  of  Common  Stock of the  Company  (with  some  restrictions),  cashless
exercises,  a reduction in the amount of any Company  liability to the optionee,
any other form of consideration  permitted by applicable law, or any combination
thereof.

         (c) TERM OF OPTION.  The term of an  incentive  stock  option may be no
more than ten (10) years from the date of grant; provided that in the case of an
incentive stock option granted to a 10% shareholder,  the term of the option may
be no more  than  five (5)  years  from  the date of  grant.  No  option  may be
exercised after the expiration of its term.

         (d)  TERMINATION  OF  EMPLOYMENT.   If  an  optionee's   employment  or
consulting   relationship   terminates  for  any  reason   (including  death  or
disability),  then all options held by the optionee under the Plan expire on the
earlier  of (i) the date set  forth  in his or her  notice  of grant or (ii) the
expiration  date of such option.  The Plan and the option  agreement may provide
for a longer period of time for the option to be exercised  after the optionee's
death or  disability  than for other  terminations.  To the extent the option is
exercisable  at the time of such  termination,  the optionee (or the  optionee's
estate or the person who acquires the right to exercise the option by bequest or
inheritance)  may  exercise  all or part of his or her option at any time before
termination.

         (e)  NONTRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS:  Unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator, options granted under the Plan are not transferable other than by
will or the laws of descent and  distribution,  and may be exercised  during the
optionee's lifetime only by the optionee.

         (f) OTHER  PROVISIONS:  The stock option  agreement  may contain  other
terms,  provisions  and  conditions  not  inconsistent  with  the Plan as may be
determined by the Administrator.

         STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.  In the case of SPRs,  unless the  Administrator
determines  otherwise,  the Restricted Stock Purchase  Agreement shall grant the
Company a  repurchase  option  exercisable  upon the  voluntary  or  involuntary
termination  of the  purchaser's  employment  with the  Company  for any  reason
(including  death or  disability).  The  purchase  price for Shares  repurchased
pursuant to the Restricted Stock Purchase  Agreement shall be the original price
paid by the purchaser and may be paid by 


                                      -6-

<PAGE>


cancellation of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase
option shall lapse at a rate determined by the Administrator.

         ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION. In the event that the stock
of the Company changes by reason of any stock split,  reverse stock split, stock
dividend,  combination,  reclassification or other similar change in the capital
structure  of  the  Company  effected  without  the  receipt  of  consideration,
appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number and class of shares of stock
subject  to the Plan,  the  number  and class of shares of stock  subject to any
option or stock  purchase  right  outstanding  under the Plan,  and the exercise
price of any such outstanding option or stock purchase right.

         In the event of a liquidation or dissolution,  any unexercised  options
or stock purchase  rights will  terminate.  The  Administrator  may, in its sole
discretion,  provide that each optionee  shall have the right to exercise all of
the optionee's options and stock purchase rights,  including those not otherwise
exercisable.

         In connection with any merger, consolidation,  acquisition of assets or
like occurrence involving the Company, each outstanding option or stock purchase
right  shall be  assumed or an  equivalent  option or right  substituted  by the
successor  corporation.  If the  successor  corporation  refuses  to assume  the
options and stock  purchase  rights or to  substitute  substantially  equivalent
options and stock purchase rights,  the Administrator  shall have the discretion
to allow the optionee to exercise the option or stock  purchase  right as to all
the optioned stock, including shares not otherwise  exercisable.  In such event,
the  Administrator  shall notify the optionee that the option or stock  purchase
right is fully  exercisable  for fifteen  (15) days from the date of such notice
and that the option or stock purchase right  terminates  upon expiration of such
period.

         AMENDMENT  AND  TERMINATION  OF THE PLAN.  The Board may amend,  alter,
suspend or  terminate  the Plan,  or any part  thereof,  at any time and for any
reason. However, the Company shall obtain shareholder approval for any amendment
to the Plan to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with applicable law.
No such  action by the Board or  shareholders  may alter or impair any option or
stock  purchase  right  previously  granted  under the Plan  without the written
consent of the optionee.  Unless terminated earlier, the Plan shall terminate in
August 2002.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

         INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS.  An optionee who is granted an incentive stock
option does not  recognize  taxable  income at the time the option is granted or
upon its exercise,  although the exercise is an adjustment  item for alternative
minimum tax  purposes and may subject the  optionee to the  alternative  minimum
tax.  Upon a  disposition  of the shares  more than two years after grant of the
option and one year after exercise of the option, any gain or loss is treated as
long-term  capital gain or loss.  Net capital  gains on shares held more than 12
months may be taxed at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Capital losses are allowed
in full against  capital gains and up to $3,000  against other income.  If these
holding periods are not satisfied,  the optionee  recognizes  ordinary income at
the time of disposition  equal to the difference  between the exercise price and
the lower of (i) the fair  market  value of the shares at the date of the option
exercise or (ii) the sale price of the shares.  Any gain or loss  recognized  on
such a premature  disposition  of the shares in excess of the amount  treated as
ordinary  income is treated as  long-term  or  short-term  capital gain or loss,
depending on the holding period. A different rule for measuring  ordinary income
upon such a premature  disposition may apply if the optionee is also an officer,
director, or 10% shareholder of the Company. Unless limited by Section 162(m) of
the Code,  the  Company is  entitled  to a  deduction  in the same amount as the
ordinary income recognized by the optionee.

         NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS.  An optionee does not recognize any taxable
income  at the time he or she is  granted  a  nonstatutory  stock  option.  Upon
exercise,  the optionee  recognizes  taxable  income  


                                      -7-


<PAGE>


generally  measured  by the excess of the then fair  market  value of the shares
over the exercise  price.  Any taxable income  recognized in connection  with an
option  exercise by an employee of the Company is subject to tax  withholding by
the  Company.  Unless  limited by  Section  162(m) of the Code,  the  Company is
entitled to a deduction in the same amount as the ordinary income  recognized by
the optionee.  Upon a disposition of such shares by the optionee, any difference
between  the sale price and the  optionee's  exercise  price,  to the extent not
recognized  as taxable  income as provided  above,  is treated as  long-term  or
short-term  capital gain or loss,  depending on the holding period.  Net capital
gains on shares held more than 12 months may be taxed at a maximum  federal rate
of 20%.  Capital  losses are  allowed in full  against  capital  gains and up to
$3,000 against other income.

         STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS. Stock purchase rights will generally be taxed in
the same manner as  nonstatutory  stock options.  However,  restricted  stock is
generally  purchased upon the exercise of a stock purchase right. At the time of
purchase,  restricted  stock is subject to a  "substantial  risk of  forfeiture"
within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code, because the Company may repurchase
the stock when the  purchaser  ceases to provide  services to the Company.  As a
result of this substantial risk of forfeiture,  the purchaser will not recognize
ordinary income at the time of purchase.  Instead,  the purchaser will recognize
ordinary  income  on  the  dates  when  the  stock  is no  longer  subject  to a
substantial  risk of forfeiture  (i.e.,  when the Company's  right of repurchase
lapses).  The purchaser's  ordinary income is measured as the difference between
the purchase  price and the fair market value of the stock on the date the stock
is no longer subject to right of repurchase.

         The  purchaser  may  accelerate  to the  date  of  purchase  his or her
recognition  of ordinary  income,  if any,  and begin his or her  capital  gains
holding period by timely filing,  (i.e, within thirty days of the purchase),  an
election  pursuant to Section  83(b) of the Code.  In such event,  the  ordinary
income  recognized,  if any, is measured as the difference  between the purchase
price and the fair market  value of the stock on the date of  purchase,  and the
capital  gain  holding  period  commences  on such  date.  The  ordinary  income
recognized by a purchaser who is an employee will be subject to tax  withholding
by the Company.  Different  rules may apply if the purchaser is also an officer,
director, or 10% shareholder of the Company.

         THE  FOREGOING  IS ONLY A  SUMMARY  OF THE  EFFECT  OF  FEDERAL  INCOME
TAXATION UPON OPTIONEES,  HOLDERS OF STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS, AND THE COMPANY WITH
RESPECT TO THE GRANT AND EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER THE
PLAN.  IT DOES  NOT  PURPORT  TO BE  COMPLETE,  AND  DOES  NOT  DISCUSS  THE TAX
CONSEQUENCES  OF THE EMPLOYEE'S OR  CONSULTANT'S  DEATH OR THE PROVISIONS OF THE
INCOME  TAX LAWS OF ANY  MUNICIPALITY,  STATE OR  FOREIGN  COUNTRY  IN WHICH THE
EMPLOYEE OR CONSULTANT MAY RESIDE.

(1)   The number and percentage of shares beneficially owned is determined under
      rules  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC"),   and  the
      information is not necessarily  indicative of beneficial ownership for any
      other purpose. Under such rules,  beneficial ownership includes any shares
      as to which the  individual  has sole or shared voting power or investment
      power and also any shares  which the  individual  has the right to acquire
      within  sixty  days of March 5, 1999  through  the  exercise  of any stock
      option or other right. Unless otherwise  indicated in the footnotes,  each
      person has sole voting and  investment  power (or shares such powers) with
      respect to the shares shown as beneficially owned.
(2)   This  information  was  obtained  from filings made with the SEC pursuant 
      to Sections 13(d) or 13(g) of the Exchange Act.

                COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

         Section  16(a) of the  Exchange  Act  ("Section  16(a)")  requires  the
Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a
registered  class  of the  Company's  equity  securities,  to  file  reports  of
ownership  on Form 3 and  changes  in  ownership  on  Form 4 or Form 5 with  the
Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") and the National  Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Such officers,  directors and ten-percent  stockholders
are also  required by SEC rules to furnish  the Company  with copies of all such
forms that they file.

         Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms  received by the
Company,  or written  representations  from certain  reporting  persons that all
Forms 5 required for such persons were filed,  the Company  believes that during

amount  outstanding  in 1997 was  $200,000.  In February  1998 the Board forgave
$50,000 of the debt based upon Mr. Caswell's meeting certain  performance goals,
and the total amount  currently  outstanding is $150,000.  The loan is due April

earlier, and accrues interest at a rate of 8%.

(1)   All options in this table are  incentive  stock  options and were  granted
      under the 1992 Stock  Option Plan and have  exercise  prices  equal to the
      fair market value on the date of grant.  All such  options  have  ten-year
      terms and vest over a five-year period at the rate of one-fifth at the end
      of one year from the date of grant and 1/60th each month thereafter.
(2)   The Company granted options to purchase 758,000 shares of Common Stock to
      employees in fiscal 1998.
(3)   Options may terminate  before their  expiration  upon the  termination  of
      optionee's status as an employee or consultant, the optionee's death or an
      acquisition of the Company.
(4)   Potential realizable value assumes that the stock price increases from the
      exercise price from the date of grant until the end of the option term (10
      years) at the  annual  rate  specified  (5% and 10%).  Annual  compounding
      results in total appreciation of approximately  62.9% (at 5% per year) and
      159.4% (at 10% per year).  The assumed  annual rates of  appreciation  are
      specified  in SEC rules and do not  represent  the  Company's  estimate or
      projection of future stock price growth.  The Company does not necessarily
      agree that this method can properly determine the value of an option.

         REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

         The Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee")
consists of directors Monte F. Zweben and Frank H. Robinson,  neither of whom is
an employee or officer of the Company. The Committee sets policy and administers
the Company's cash and equity  incentive  programs for the purpose of attracting
and retaining highly skilled  executives who will promote the Company's business
goals and build long-term  stockholder  value. The Committee is also responsible
for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding all
forms of compensation to be provided to the executive  officers and directors of
the Company,  including stock  compensation  and loans,  and all bonus and stock
compensation to all employees.

         To the extent  appropriate,  the Company  intends to take the necessary
steps to  conform  its  compensation  practices  to comply  with the $1  million
compensation  deduction cap under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.

COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND POLICIES

         The  policy of the  Committee  is to attract  and retain key  personnel
through the payment of  competitive  base  salaries and to encourage  and reward
performance through bonuses and stock ownership.  The Committee's objectives are
to:

o        ensure that the executive team has clear goals and accountability with 
         respect to corporate performance;

o        establish  pay   opportunities   that  are  competitive   based  on
         prevailing practices for the industry, the stage of growth, and the
         labor markets in which the Company operates;

o        independently assess operating results on a regular basis in light of 
         expected Company performance; and

o        align pay incentives with the long-term interests of the Company's 
         stockholders.

ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION

         Compensation  for officers  and key  employees  includes  both cash and
equity elements.

         Cash compensation  consists of base salary,  which is determined on the
basis of the level of responsibility,  expertise and experience of the employee,
and  competitive  conditions  in the industry.  The Committee  believes that the
salaries of its officers  fall within the software  industry  norm. In addition,
cash bonuses may be awarded to officers  and other key  employees;  however,  no
executive officer received a cash bonus in 1998. Compensation of sales personnel
also includes sales commissions tied to quarterly targets.

         Ownership of the  Company's  Common Stock is a key element of executive
compensation.  Officers  and other  employees  of the  Company  are  eligible to
participate  in the 1992 Stock Plan (the  "Option  Plan") and the 1995  Employee
Stock  Purchase  Plan (the  "Purchase  Plan"),  which were adopted  prior to the
Company's  initial public offering in November 1995. The Option Plan permits the
Board of Directors or the  Committee to grant stock options to employees on such
terms as the Board or the  Committee may  determine.  The Committee has the sole
authority  to grant stock  options to  executive  officers of the Company and is
currently administering stock option grants to all employees. In determining the
size of a stock  option  grant to a new  officer  or  other  key  employee,  the
Committee takes


                                      -14-
<PAGE>



into account equity participation by comparable employees within the Company,
external  competitive  circumstances  and other relevant  factors. Additional  
options may be granted to current  employees  to reward  exceptional performance
or to provide additional  unvested equity  incentives. The Purchase Plan permits
employees to acquire Common Stock of the Company  through  payroll deductions 
and promotes broad-based equity participation throughout the Company. The  
Committee  believes  that  such  stock  plans  align the  interests  of the
employees with the long-term interests of the stockholders.

         The Company also maintains a 401(k) Plan to provide retirement benefits
through  tax  deferred  salary  deductions  for all its  employees.  The Company
matches  up to  50%  of an  employee's  contribution,  not to  exceed  $500  per
employee.

1998 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         Executive   compensation  for  1998  included  base  salary,  cash  and
equity-based incentive compensation and, in the case of sales executives,  sales
commissions.  Cash incentive  compensation is designed to motivate executives to
attain corporate, business unit and individual goals. The Company's policy is to
have a significant portion of an executive's total compensation at risk based on
the Company's  overall  performance.  Since 1996,  the Company has  maintained a
profit  sharing  plan  for  its  employees,   and  certain  executive   officers
participated in this program in 1998. Executive officers,  like other employees,
were eligible for option grants under the Option Plan.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

         Compensation for the Chief Executive Officer is determined by a process
similar to that  discussed  above for executive  officers.  The Chief  Executive
Officer's  target  base pay level has been  analyzed  using data for  comparable
software  companies.  Ms.  DiMarco  receives no other material  compensation  or
benefits not provided to all executive officers.

         The Committee has considered the potential  impact of Section 162(m) of
the  Internal   Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended,   which  limits  the  tax
deductibility of cash compensation paid to individual  executive  officers to $1
million per officer. The cash compensation to be paid to the Company's executive
officers  in fiscal  1996 is not  expected  to exceed the $1  million  limit per
individual officer.

              Directors, Officers who are not Directors, and Employees who are
              neither Directors nor Officers.  

         (ii) Administration  With Respect to Directors and Officers Subject to 
              Section 16(b).  With respect to Option or Stock Purchase Right 
              grants made to  Employees  who are also  Officers or Directors  
              subject to Section  16(b) of the Exchange  Act, the Plan shall be 
              administered  by (A) the Board, if the Board may administer the 
              Plan in a manner complying with the rules under  Rule 16b-3  
              relating  to the  disinterested  administration  of  employee
              benefit plans under 

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

              which Section 16(b) exempt  discretionary  grants and awards of 
              equity securities are to be made, or (B) a committee  designated 
              by the Board to administer the Plan,  which committee shall be 
              constituted to comply with the rules under Rule 16b-3 relating to 
              the disinterested  administration of employee benefit plans under 
              which Section 16(b) exempt  discretionary  grants and awards of 
              equity  securities  are to be made.  Once  appointed,  such  
              Committee  shall continue to serve in its  designated  capacity 
              until  otherwise  directed by the Board.  From time to time the 
              Board may increase the size of the  Committee  and appoint  
              additional  members,   remove  members  (with  or  without  cause)
              and substitute new members,  fill vacancies (however caused), and 
              remove all members of the Committee and thereafter  directly 
              administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted  by  the  rules  
              under  Rule  16b-3  relating  to  the   disinterested 
              administration  of  employee  benefit  plans under which  Section
              16(b)  exempt discretionary  grants  and  awards of equity  
              securities  are to be made.  

        (iii) Administration  With Respect to Other  Persons.  With respect to 
              Option or Stock Purchase Right grants made to Employees or 
              Consultants who are neither Directors nor Officers of the Company,
              the Plan shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a committee
              designated by the Board, which committee shall be constituted to
              satisfy  Applicable  Laws.  Once  appointed,  such Committee shall
              serve in its designated  capacity  until  otherwise  directed  by 
              the  Board.  The  Board may increase  the size of the  Committee  
              and  appoint  additional  members,  remove members  (with or 
              without  cause) and  substitute  new members,  fill  vacancies 
              (however  caused),  and  remove  all  members of the  Committee  
              and  thereafter directly  administer the Plan, all to the extent  
              permitted by Applicable  Laws. 

     (b) Powers of the  Administrator.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, 
         and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties 
         delegated by the Board to  such  Committee,   the  Administrator  shall
         have  the  authority,  in  its discretion:  

          (i) to  determine  the Fair Market  Value of the Common  Stock,  in
              accordance  with Section 2(l) of the Plan;  
 
         (ii) to select the Consultants  and Employees to whom Options and Stock
              Purchase  Rights may be granted  hereunder; 

        (iii) to determine whether and to what extent Options and Stock Purchase
              Rights or any combination thereof, are granted hereunder;  

         (iv) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by
              each Option and Stock  Purchase Right granted  hereunder;  

          (v) to approve  forms of agreement  for use under the Plan;
     
         (vi) to determine the terms and conditions,  not inconsistent  with the
              terms of the Plan, of any award granted hereunder. Such terms and 
              conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price,  
              the time or times when Options or Stock Purchase Rights may be 
              exercised  (which may be based on performance  criteria), any 
              vesting  acceleration  or  waiver  of  forfeiture  restrictions,  
              and  any restriction  or limitation  regarding any Option or Stock
              Purchase Right or the

                                      -4-
<PAGE>


              shares of Common Stock relating  thereto,  
              based in each case on such factors as the Administrator,  in its 
              sole discretion, shall determine; 

        (vii) to reduce the exercise  price of any Option or Stock  Purchase  
              Right to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market 
              Value of the Common Stock covered by such Option or Stock Purchase
              Right shall have declined since the date the Option or Stock 
              Purchase  Right was granted;  

       (viii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards granted
              pursuant  to the Plan;  

         (ix) to  prescribe,  amend and rescind  rules and regulations  relating
              to the  Plan,  including  rules  and regulations relating to 
              sub-plans  established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred
              tax  treatment  under  foreign tax laws;  

          (x) to modify or amend each Option or Stock Purchase Right (subject to
              Section 14(b) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority 
              to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options 
              longer than is otherwise  provided for in the Plan; 

         (xi) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any 
              instrument required to effect the  grant of an  Option  or Stock  
              Purchase  Right  previously  granted  by the Administrator;  

        (xii) to  determine  the terms and  restrictions  applicable  to Options
              and Stock Purchase Rights and any Restricted  Stock;  and 

       (xiii) to make all other  determinations  deemed necessary or advisable 
              for  administering  the Plan. 

     (c) Effect of Administrator's Decision. All decisions,  determinations and
         interpretations of the Administrator shall be final and binding on all 
         Optionees and any other holders of any Options or Stock Purchase 
         Rights.  

5.  Eligibility.

     (a)  Nonstatutory  Stock  Options  and Stock  Purchase  Rights may be 
          granted to Employees  and  Consultants.  Incentive  Stock Options  may
          be granted  only to Employees.  An Employee or  Consultant  who has 
          been  granted an Option or Stock Purchase Right may, if he or she is 
          otherwise  eligible,  be granted  additional Options or Stock Purchase
          Rights.  

     (b) Each Option shall be  designated in the written option  agreement as 
         either an Incentive  Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. 
         However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the
         aggregate  Fair  Market  Value of the Shares  with  respect  to  which 
         Options designated as Incentive  Stock Options are exercisable for the 
         first time by any Optionee  

                                      -5-


<PAGE>


         during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company or any Parent
         or  Subsidiary)  exceeds  $100,000,  such  excess  Options  shall be  
         treated as Nonstatutory  Stock Options.  

     (c) For purposes of Section 5(b),  Incentive Stock Options shall be taken
         into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair  
         Market  Value of the  Shares  shall be  determined  as of the time the
         Option with  respect to such  Shares is  granted.  

     (d) The Plan shall not confer upon any  Optionee any right with  respect to
         continuation  of  employment  or consulting relationship with the 
         Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with his or her right or the
         Company's  right to terminate  his or her  employment or consulting 
         relationship at any time,  with or without cause.  
 
     (e) The following limitations  shall  apply to grants of  Options  and  
         Stock  Purchase  Rights to Employees:  

          (i) No Employee shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the Company,
              Options and Stock Purchase Rights to purchase more than 150,000 
              Shares.  

         (ii) In connection  with his or her  initial  employment,  an  Employee
              may be  granted Options and Stock Purchase Rights to purchase up 
              to an additional 150,000 Shares which shall not count against the 
              limit set forth in subsection (i) above. 

        (iii) The foregoing  limitations shall be adjusted  proportionately in 
              connection with any change in the Company's  capitalization  as
              described in Section 12. 

         (iv) If an Option or Stock  Purchase  Right is  cancelled in the same
              fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted  (other than in
              connection  with a  transaction described in Section 12), the 
              cancelled  Option or Stock  Purchase Right will be counted against
              the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this
              purpose,  if the exercise price of an Option or Stock Purchase 
              Right is reduced, the  transaction  will be  treated  as a  
              cancellation  of the  Option or Stock Purchase Right and the grant
              of a new Option or Stock Purchase Right. 

6. Term of Plan. The Plan shall become  effective upon the earlier to occur
of its adoption by the Board of Directors or its approval by the stockholders of
the Company as described in Section 18 of the Plan. It shall  continue in effect
for a term of ten (10) years unless  sooner  terminated  under Section 14 of the
Plan. 

7. Term of Option. The term of each Option shall be the term stated in the
Option  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that the term shall be no more than ten
(10) years from the date of grant thereof.  However, in the case of an Incentive
Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns
stock  representing  more  than ten  percent  (10%) of the  voting  power of all
classes of stock of the  Company or any Parent or  Subsidiary,  the term of such
Option  shall be five (5) years from the date of grant  thereof or such  shorter
term as may be provided in the Option  Agreement.

8. Option  Exercise  Price and  Consideration.  

     (a) The per Share  exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to 
         the exercise of an Option shall be such price as is  determined by the 
         Administrator,  but shall be subject to the following:  

          (i) In the case of an  Incentive  Stock  Option  

               (1)  granted  to an Employee  who, at the time of the grant of 
                    such  Incentive  Stock  Option,  owns stock  representing 
                    more  than ten  percent  (10%) of the  voting  power of all
                    classes  of stock of the  Company  or any  Parent or  
                    Subsidiary,  the per Share exercise  price shall be no less 
                    than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of 
                    grant.  

               (2)  granted to any other  Employee,  the per Share  exercise
                    price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market  Value 
                    per Share on the date of  grant.  

         (ii) In the  case of a  Nonstatutory  Stock  Option,  the per  Share
              exercise  price  shall  be  determined  by  the   Administrator.  
     (b)  Form  of Consideration.   The  Administrator  shall  determine  the  
          acceptable  form  of consideration for exercising an Option, including
          the method of payment. In the case of an  Incentive  Stock  Option,  
          the  Administrator  shall  determine  the acceptable form of 
          consideration at the time of grant.  Such  consideration  may consist 
          entirely of: 
 
          (i) cash; 
     
         (ii) check;  

        (iii)  promissory  note; 

         (iv) other Shares which (A)in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise
              of an option, have been owned by the  Optionee  for more than six 
              months on the date of  surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value
              on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise  price of
              the Shares as to which said Option  shall be  exercised;  

          (v) delivery  of a  properly  executed  exercise notice together  with
              such  other documentation as the Administrator and the broker, if 
              applicable,  shall require to effect an exercise  of the Option 
              and  delivery to the Company of the sale or loan proceeds required
              to pay the exercise price; 

         (vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the 
              Optionee,  including any liability  attributable to the Optionee's
              participation in any Company-sponsored  deferred compensation
              program  or  arrangement;  
 
        (vii) any  combination  of the  foregoing  methods of payment;  or 


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

       (viii)  such other  consideration  and  method of  payment  for the
               issuance of Shares to the extent  permitted by  Applicable  Laws.

9. Exercise of Option. 

     (a) Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder.  Any Option granted
         hereunder  shall be  exercisable  at such  times and under  such 
         conditions  as determined by the Administrator,  including performance 
         criteria with respect to the Company and/or the Optionee,  and as shall
         be permissible under the terms of the Plan.

      An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

      An Option shall be deemed to be exercised  when written  notice of such
exercise  has been  given to the  Company  in  accordance  with the terms of the
Option by the person  entitled to exercise  the Option and full  payment for the
Shares with  respect to which the Option is exercised  has been  received by the
Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the  Administrator,  consist of any
consideration  and method of payment  allowable  under Section 8(b) of the Plan.
Until the issuance (as  evidenced by the  appropriate  entry on the books of the
Company or of a duly  authorized  transfer  agent of the  Company)  of the stock
certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any
other rights as a  stockholder  shall exist with respect to the Optioned  Stock,
notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to
be issued)  such stock  certificate  promptly  upon  exercise of the Option.  No
adjustment  will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date
is prior to the date the stock  certificate  is issued,  except as  provided  in
Section 12 of the Plan.

      Exercise of an Option in any manner  shall  result in a decrease in the
number of Shares which  thereafter  may be  available,  both for purposes of the
Plan and for sale  under  the  Option,  by the  number of Shares as to which the
Option is exercised.  

     (b) Termination of Employment or Consulting  Relationship. Upon termination
         of  an  Optionee's   Continuous Status  as  an  Employee or Consultant,
         other than upon the Optionee's death or Disability, the Optionee may
         exercise his or her Option,  but only within such period of time as is 
         specified in the Notice of Grant, and only to the extent that the 
         Optionee was entitled to exercise  it at the  date  of  termination  
         (but  in no  event  later  than  the expiration  of the term of such 
         Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant).  In the absence of a 
         specified time in the Notice of Grant,  the Option shall remain
         exercisable for three (3) months  following the Optionee's termination.
         In the case of an Incentive  Stock Option,  such period of time for 
         exercise  shall not exceed  three  (3)  months  from the  date of  
         termination.  If,  on the date of termination,  the  Optionee is not 
         entitled to exercise  the  Optionee's  entire Option,  the Shares  
         covered by the  unexercisable  portion of the Option  shall revert to 
         the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or
         her Option  within the time  specified  by the  Administrator,  the 
         Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall 
         revert to the Plan.

      Notwithstanding  the  above,  in the event of an  Optionee's  change in
status from  Consultant to Employee or Employee to  Consultant,  the  Optionee's
Continuous Status as an Employee or 


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Consultant shall not automatically terminate solely  as a result  of such change
in  status.  However,  in such  event,  an Incentive  Stock  Option  held by the
Optionee  shall cease to be treated as an Incentive  Stock Option and shall be 
treated for tax purposes as a  Nonstatutory Stock  Option  three  months and one
day  following  such change of status.  

     (c) Disability of Optionee.  In the event that an Optionee's Continuous 
         Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates as a result of the
         Optionee's Disability,  the Optionee may  exercise  his or her Option 
         at any time within twelve (12)months from the date of such termination,
         but only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it at
         the date of such  termination  (but in no event later than the  
         expiration  of the term of such  Option as set forth in the  Notice of
         Grant). If, at the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to
         exercise his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the
         unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after
         termination,  the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within
         the time  specified  herein,  the Option shall terminate,  and the 
         Shares  covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan. 

     (d) Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of an Optionee,  the 
         Option may be exercised at any time within twelve (12) months following
         the date of death (but in no event later than the expiration of the
         term of such Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant),  by the 
         Optionee's  estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise 
         the Option by bequest or  inheritance,  but only to the extent that the
         Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of death.  If,
         at the time of death,  the  Optionee  was not  entitled to  exercise  
         his or her entire  Option,  the Shares covered by the  unexercisable  
         portion of the Option shall immediately  revert to the Plan. If, after 
         death, the Optionee's estate or a person who acquired the right to 
         exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance does not exercise the 
         Option within the time specified herein,  the Option shall terminate,  
         and the Shares  covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan. 

     (e) Buyout  Provisions.  The  Administrator  may at any time  offer to buy 
         out for a payment in cash or Shares, an Option previously granted,
         based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish
         and communicate to the Optionee at the time that  such  offer  is made.
     
     (f) Rule  16b-3.  Options  granted  to individuals subject to Section 16 of
         the Exchange Act ("Insiders")  must comply with the applicable  
         provisions of Rule 16b-3 and shall contain such  additional conditions 
         or  restrictions  as may be required  thereunder  to qualify for the
         maximum  exemption  from  Section 16 of the  Exchange  Act with  espect
         to Plan transactions.  

10.  Non-Transferability  of Options.  The Option may not be sold, pledged,
assigned, hypothecated,  transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by
will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised,  during the
lifetime of the Optionee,  only by the Optionee.  

11. Stock Purchase Rights. 

     (a) Rights to  Purchase.  Stock  Purchase  Rights  may be issued  either  
         alone,  in addition to, or in tandem with other awards  granted  under
         the Plan and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the 
         Administrator determines that it will offer  Stock  Purchase  Rights  
         under the Plan,  it shall  advise the offeree in writing of the  terms,
         conditions  and  restrictions  related  to  the  offer, 


                                      -9-

<PAGE>

         including  the number of Shares that such person  shall be entitled to 
         purchase, the price to be paid and the time  within  which such  person
         must  accept such offer,  which shall in no event exceed ninety (90) 
         days from the date upon which the Administrator  made the determination
         to grant the Stock Purchase Right. The offer shall be accepted by 
         execution of a purchase  agreement  (the  "Restricted Stock Purchase  
         Agreement") in the form determined by the Administrator.  Shares
         purchased  pursuant to the grant of a Stock  Purchase Right shall be 
         referred to herein as "Restricted  Stock". 

     (b) Repurchase  Option. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise,  the
         Restricted Stock Purchase  Agreement shall grant the Company a 
         repurchase  option exercisable  upon the  voluntary  or  involuntary 
         termination  of the purchaser's  employment  with the  Company  for any
         reason (including death or  Disability). The purchase  price for Shares
         repurchased pursuant to the Restricted Stock Purchase  Agreement shall 
         be the original price paid by the purchaser and may be paid by
         cancellation of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the Company.  The 
         repurchase option shall lapse at such rate as the Administrator may 
         determine. 

     (c) Other Provisions. The Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall contain
         such  other  terms,  provisions  and  conditions  not inconsistent with
         the Plan as may be determined by the Administrator in its sole
         discretion.  In addition, the provisions of Restricted Stock purchase 
         agreements need  not  be  the  same  with respect  to  each  purchaser.

     (d)  Rights  as a Stockholder.  Once the Stock Purchase Right is exercised,
          the purchaser  shall have the rights equivalent to those of a 
          stockholder, and shall be a stockholder when his or her  purchase  is 
          entered  upon the  records of the duly  authorized transfer  agent of 
          the  Company.  No  adjustment  will be made for a dividend or other  
          right for which the record date is prior to the date the Stock 
          Purchase Right is  exercised,  except as  provided  in Section  12 of 
          the Plan.  

     (e) Rule 16b-3.  Stock  Purchase  Rights  granted to  Insiders,  and Shares
         purchased by Insiders  in  connection  with Stock  Purchase  Rights, 
         shall be subject to any restrictions  applicable  thereto in compliance
         with Rule 16b-3. An Insider may only purchase Shares  pursuant to the 
         grant of a Stock Purchase  Right,  and may only sell  Shares  purchased
         pursuant to the grant of a Stock  Purchase  Right, during such time or 
         times as are permitted by Rule 16b-3.  

12.  Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution or Merger. 

     (a) Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the 
         stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common  Stock  
         covered by each  outstanding  Option or Stock  Purchase Right,  and the
         number of shares of Common Stock which have been  authorized for
         issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options or Stock Purchase 
         Rights have yet been granted or which have been  returned to the Plan 
         upon  cancellation or expiration of an Option or Stock Purchase  Right,
         as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each such 
         outstanding Option or Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately  
         adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of
         Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock  
         dividend,  combination or  reclassification  of the Common Stock,  or 
         any other  increase  or  decrease  in the  number of issued  shares of 
         Common  Stock effected  without receipt of consideration  by the
         Company;  provided,  however, that conversion of any convertible 
         securities of the Company shall not 



                                      -10-
<PAGE>


         be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration". 
         Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination
         in that  respect  shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as
         expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of 
         stock of any class, or securities  convertible  into shares of stock of
         any class,  shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be 
         made with  respect  to, the  number or price of shares of Common  Stock
         subject to an Option or Stock Purchase Right. 

     (b) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed  dissolution  
         or  liquidation  of the Company,  to the extent that an Option or Stock
         Purchase Right has not been previously exercised, it will terminate 
         immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. The 
         Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, 
         declare that any Option or Stock  Purchase Right shall  terminate as of
         a date fixed by the Board and give each  Optionee  the right to  
         exercise  his or her  Option or Stock  Purchase  Right as to all or any
         part of the  Optioned  Stock,  including Shares as to which the Option 
         or Stock  Purchase  Right would not  otherwise  be exercisable.  

     (c) Merger or Asset Sale.  In the event of a merger of the Company with or 
         into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the 
         assets of the  Company,  each  outstanding  Option and Stock  Purchase 
         Right shall be assumed  or  an  equivalent   option  or  right  
         substituted  by  the  successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary 
         of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor   
         corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or Stock 
         Purchase  Right,  Administrator  shall have the  discretion  to allow 
         the Optionee  to  exercise  the  Option  or  Stock  Purchase  Right as 
         to all of the Optioned  Stock,  including  Shares  as to  which  it 
         would  not  otherwise  be exercisable.  If an Option or Stock  Purchase
         Right is  exercisable  in lieu of assumption  or  substitution  in the 
         event of a merger or sale of  assets,  the Administrator  shall notify 
         the Optionee that the Option or Stock Purchase Right shall be fully  
         exercisable  for a period of fifteen  (15) days from the date of such 
         notice,  and the Option or Stock  Purchase  Right shall  terminate upon
         the expiration  of such period.  For the purposes of this  paragraph, 
         the Option or Stock  Purchase  Right shall be considered  assumed if, 
         following the merger or sale of assets,  the option or right  confers  
         the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned  Stock 
         subject to the Option or Stock  Purchase Right immediately prior to the
         merger or sale of assets,  the  consideration  (whether stock,  cash, 
         or other securities or property) received in the merger or sale of 
         assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the  effective
         date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of 
         consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a 
         majority of the outstanding Shares); provided,  however, that if such 
         consideration received in the merger or sale of assets was not solely 
         common stock of the successor  corporation  or its Parent, the 
         Administrator  may, with the consent of the successor  corporation,  
         provide for the  consideration  to be received  upon the exercise of 
         the Option or Stock Purchase Right,  for each Share of Optioned Stock 
         subject to the Option or Stock Purchase  Right,  to be solely common 
         stock of the successor  corporation or its Parent  equal in fair market
         value to the per share  consideration  received by holders of Common 
         Stock in the merger or sale of assets.  

13. Date of Grant. The date of grant of an Option or Stock Purchase Right shall,
for all purposes, be the date on which the Administrator makes the determination
granting such Option or


                                      -11-

<PAGE>


Stock  Purchase   Right,  or  such  other  date  as  is determined  by  the 
Administrator.  Notice of the  determination  shall be given to each Employee or
Consultant  to whom an Option or Stock  Purchase  Right is so granted  within a 
reasonable time after the date of such grant.  

14. Amendment and Termination of the Plan. 

     (a) Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend, alter, 
         suspend or  discontinue  the Plan, but no amendment,  alteration,  
         suspension or discontinuation  shall be made which would  impair  the 
         rights of any  Optionee under any grant theretofore made without his or
         her consent. In addition, to the extent  necessary  and  desirable to 
         comply with Section 422 of the Code (or any other  applicable  law or  
         regulation),  the Company  shall  obtain  stockholder approval  of any
         Plan  amendment  in  such a  manner and to such a  degree  as required.

     (b) Effect  of  Amendment  or  Termination.  Any such  amendment  or
         termination  of the Plan  shall not  affect  Options  already  granted 
         and such Options  shall  remain  in full  force  and  effect as if this
         Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed 
         otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator, which agreement 
         must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and properly on behalf of
         the Company.  

15. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares  shall not be issued  pursuant to
the  exercise  of an Option  unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance
and  delivery of such Shares  pursuant thereto  shall comply with all relevant  
provisions of law,  including,  without limitation,  the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder,
and the  requirements  of any  stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be 
listed,  and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company
with respect to such compliance.

    As a condition  to the  exercise of an Option,  the Company may require the 
person  exercising  such Option to represent  and warrant at the time of any
such  exercise  that the  Shares are being  purchased  only for  investment  and
without  any  present  intention  to sell or  distribute  such Shares if, in the
opinion of counsel for the Company,  such a representation is required by any of
the  aforementioned  relevant  provisions of law. 

16. Reservation of Shares. The Company,  during  the term of this  Plan,  will
at all  times  reserve  and keep available  such  number  of  Shares  as  shall 
be  sufficient  to  satisfy  the requirements of the Plan.

    The inability of the Company to obtain  authority  from any  regulatory body
having jurisdiction,  which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be 
necessary  to the lawful  issuance  and sale of any Shares  hereunder,  shall
relieve the Company of any  liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell
such Shares as to which such requisite  authority  shall not have been obtained.

17. Agreements.  Options and Stock Purchase Rights shall be evidenced by written
agreements  in such form as the  Administrator  shall approve from time to time.
Such agreements


                                      -12-

may contain such other terms and conditions, including rights of repurchase and 
rights of first  refusal,  as the  Administrator  may in its sole discretion 
deem appropriate.  

18. Stockholder Approval.  Continuance of the Plan shall be subject to approval 
by the  stockholders  of the Company  within twelve (12)  months before or after
the date the Plan is  adopted.  Such  stockholder approval shall be obtained in 
the degree and manner  required  under  applicable state and federal law.

         Termination Period.

         This Option may be exercised for _____  [days/months] after termination
of the Optionee's  employment or consulting  relationship with the Company. Upon
the death or Disability  of the Optionee,  this Option may be exercised for such
longer period as provided in the Plan. In the event of the Optionee's  change in
status from  Employee to  Consultant  or  Consultant  to  Employee,  this Option
Agreement  shall  remain in effect.  In no event shall this Option be  exercised
later than the Term/Expiration Date as provided above.

II.      AGREEMENT

     1. Grant of Option.  The Plan Administrator of the Company hereby grants to
the Optionee  named in the Notice of Grant  attached as Part I of this Agreement
(the  "Optionee") an option (the "Option") to purchase the number of Shares,  as
set forth in the Notice of Grant,  at the exercise  price per share set forth in
the Notice of Grant (the "Exercise Price"),  subject to the terms and conditions
of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 14(b)
of the Plan, in the event of a conflict  between the terms and conditions of the
Plan and the  terms  and  conditions  of this  Option  Agreement,  the terms and
conditions of the Plan shall prevail.

     If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive  Stock Option ("ISO"),
this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive  Stock  Option under  Section
422 of the Code.  However,  if this Option is intended to be an Incentive  Stock
Option,  to the extent that it exceeds the $100,000 rule of Code Section  422(d)
it shall be treated as a  Nonstatutory  Stock  Option  ("NSO").  

     2. Exercise of Option.  

          (a) Right to Exercise.  This Option is  exercisable during its term in
 accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice of Grant and the 
applicable  provisions of the Plan and this Option  Agreement.  In the event of 
Optionee's  death,  Disability or other  termination  of Optionee's employment  
or  consulting  relationship,  the  exercisability  of the Option is governed by
the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. 

          (b) Method of  Exercise. This Option is exercisable by delivery  of an
exercise  notice,  in the form  attached as Exhibit A (the  "Exercise  Notice"),
which shall state the election to exercise  the Option,  the number of Shares in
respect of which the Option is being  exercised (the  "Exercised  Shares"),  and
such other  representations  and  agreements  as may be  required by the Company
pursuant to the provisions of the Plan.  The Exercise  Notice shall be signed by
the  Optionee  and shall be  delivered  in person  or by  certified  mail to the
Secretary of the Company. The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of
the aggregate  Exercise Price as to all Exercised  Shares.  This Option shall be
deemed to be  exercised  upon  receipt by the  Company  of such  fully  executed
Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price.

     No Shares shall be issued  pursuant to the  exercise of this Option  unless
such issuance and exercise complies with all relevant  provisions of law and the
requirements  of any stock  exchange or quotation  service upon which the Shares
are then listed. Assuming such compliance, for income tax 

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

purposes the Exercised Shares shall be considered transferred to the Optionee on
the date the Option is exercised with respect to such Exercised Shares. 

     3. Method of Payment.  Payment of the aggregate  Exercise Price shall be by
any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionee:

          (a) cash;  

          (b) check;  

          (c)  delivery  of a  properly  executed  exercise  notice together 
with such other  documentation as the  Administrator and the broker, if
applicable,  shall  require to effect an exercise of the Option and  delivery to
the Company of the sale or loan proceeds  required to pay the exercise price; or

          (d)  surrender  of other Shares  which (i) in the case of Shares 
acquired  upon exercise  of an option,  have been owned by the  Optionee  for 
more than six (6)months on the date of  surrender,  and (ii) have a Fair Market 
Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate  Exercise Price of the 
Exercised  Shares. 

     4. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any
manner  otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may
be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by the Optionee.  The terms of
the  Plan  and this  Option  Agreement  shall  be  binding  upon the  executors,
administrators,  heirs,  successors  and  assigns  of the  Optionee.  

     5. Term of Option.  This Option may be  exercised  only within the term set
out in the  Notice  of  Grant,  and may be  exercised  during  such term only in
accordance  with  the  Plan  and the  terms  of this  Option  Agreement.  

     6.  Tax  Consequences.  Some of the  federal  and  state  tax  consequences
relating to this  Option,  as of the date of this  Option,  are set forth below.
THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY  INCOMPLETE,  AND THE TAX LAWS AND  REGULATIONS  ARE
SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE  EXERCISING
THIS  OPTION  OR  DISPOSING  OF THE  SHARES.  

          (a)  Exercising  the  Option.  

               (i) Nonstatutory Stock Option. The Optionee may incur regular 
federal income tax and state income tax liability  upon exercise of a NSO. The 
Optionee will be treated as having  received  compensation  income (taxable at 
ordinary income tax rates)equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value 
of the Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over their aggregate  Exercise
Price. If the Optionee is an Employee or a former Employee, the Company will be 
required to withhold from his or her  compensation  or collect from Optionee and
pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount in cash equal to a percentage
of this compensation  income at the time of  


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

exercise,  and may  refuse to honor the  exercise  and refuse to deliver  Shares
if such  withholding  amounts are not  delivered  at the time of exercise.  

              (ii) Incentive Stock Option.  If this Option qualifies as an ISO, 
the Optionee will have no regular  federal  income tax or state income tax
liability upon its exercise,  although the excess, if any, of the Fair Market
Value of the Exercised  Shares on the date of exercise over their  aggregate  
Exercise Price will be treated as an adjustment to alternative  minimum  taxable
income for federal tax purposes and may subject the Optionee to alternative  
minimum tax in the year of  exercise.  In the event  that the  Optionee  
undergoes  a change of status from Employee to Consultant,  any Incentive  Stock
Option of the Optionee that remains unexercised shall cease to qualify as an
Incentive Stock Option and will  be  treated  for  tax  purposes  as a  
Nonstatutory  Stock  Option  on the ninety-first  (91st) day following  such 
change of status.  

          (b)  Disposition  of Shares.  

               (i) NSO. If the  Optionee holds NSO Shares for at least one year,
any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term 
capital gain for federal income tax purposes. 

              (ii) ISO. If the Optionee holds ISO Shares for at least one year 
after  exercise  and two years after the grant date, any gain realized on 
disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term  capital gain for federal
income tax  purposes.  If the Optionee  disposes of ISO Shares within one year  
after  exercise  or two years  after the grant  date,  any gain realized on such
disposition will be treated as compensation  income (taxable at ordinary income 
rates) to the extent of the excess, if any, of the lesser of (A) the difference 
between the Fair Market Value of the Shares acquired on the date of exercise and
the aggregate  Exercise Price, or (B) the difference between the sale  price of 
such  Shares  and the  aggregate  Exercise  Price.  

          (c) Notice of Disqualifying  Disposition  of ISO Shares.  If the  
Optionee  sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Shares acquired pursuant to 
an ISO on or before the later of (i) two years after the grant date, or (ii) one
year after the exercise date, the  Optionee  shall   immediately   notify  the  
Company  in  writing  of  such disposition.  The  Optionee  agrees  that he or 
she may be subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation 
income recognized from such early disposition of ISO Shares by payment in cash 
or out of the current earnings paid to the Optionee.

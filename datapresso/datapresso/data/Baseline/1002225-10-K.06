PART 1

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

     OVERVIEW

         We are a leading provider of Enterprise Investment Management solutions
that automate and integrate mission-critical functions of investment management
organizations through software products, data integration and professional
services. Our solutions enable organizations of all sizes to run their business
more effectively, enhance client service and performance, and improve
productivity and communication throughout the entire organization.

         Advent offers software products, data and data integration services and
professional services to the investment community. Advent Office(R), our suite
of integrated software products, addresses the demand to automate the entire
range of investment management functions, including portfolio management, client
relationship management, trade order management, data warehousing, partnership
accounting, reconciliation management, and web-based portfolio, performance and
analytic reporting. Advent Office(R) includes Axys(R), Advent Partner(R),
Moxy(R), Qube(R), REX(TM) and WealthLine(R). Other financial management software
products we offer are GIFTS(R), FIMS(TM) FoundationPower(TM), AdvisorMart(R),
AdvisorMart Institutional(TM), Financial Office(TM) and Web Office(TM). In
addition, Advent provides data and data integration services such as Advent
Custodial Data(TM), Advent TrustedNetwork(R), Advent Corporate Actions(TM).

         We were founded in 1983, incorporated in 1983 in California and
reincorporated in Delaware in November 1995. Our principal executive offices are
located at 301 Brannan Street, San Francisco, California 94107, and our
telephone number is (415) 543-7696. Our internet home page is located at
WWW.ADVENT.COM; however, the information in, or that can be accessed through,
our home page is not part of this report. Our annual reports on Form 10-K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to
such reports are available, free of charge, on or through our internet home page
as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material
with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.


INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND OUR CLIENTS

          Our clients include a range of organizations that manage or advise on
assets. They include firms such as asset


                                       3
<PAGE>
managers, investment advisors, brokerage firms, hedge funds, family offices,
banks and trusts. Our clients also include corporations, public funds,
foundations, universities and non-profit organizations that manage investment
portfolios and perform similar portfolio management functions. In 2002, 2001 and
2000, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues, and our
international revenue accounted for less than 8% of our total revenues.

         Over the past decade, the investment management industry has
experienced significant growth, which has led to increased demand for software
products that automate, simplify and integrate functions within investment
management organizations. As a result, investment managers are faced with
increasingly complicated portfolio accounting and management requirements as
well as extensive and evolving industry standards and government regulations.

         These trends have increased the volume and complexity of information
and data flows within investment management organizations and between
organizations and third parties, such as brokerage firms, clients, custodians,
banks, pricing services and other data providers. Consequently, in order to
operate efficiently, investment management organizations must automate and
integrate their mission-critical and labor-intensive functions, including (i)
investment decision support and client relationship management, (ii) order
management and trading and (iii) portfolio accounting, performance measurement,
report generation and compliance. Investment management organizations
historically have relied on internally developed systems, timesharing services
or simple spreadsheet-based systems to manage information flows. Due to inherent
limitations in each of these types of systems, investment management
organizations are demanding highly functional, easy-to-use, scalable, flexible
and cost-effective software applications that automate and integrate their
mission-critical business functions.

ADVENT SOLUTIONS

         Advent is evolving from a product-focused company to a solution-focused
company. Advent solutions are comprised of various combinations of software
products, data integration tools and professional services all aimed at solving
our clients' critical business issues.

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

         We offer an integrated suite of software products for automating and
integrating data and work flows across the investment management organization,
as well as the information flows between the investment management organization
and external parties. Our products are intended to increase operational
efficiency, improve the accuracy of client information and enable better
decision-making. Each software product focuses on specific mission-critical
functions of the investment management organization and is tailored to meet the
needs of the particular client, as determined by size, assets under management
and complexity of the investment environment.

         AXYS(R), our core application, introduced in 1993, is a highly
functional portfolio accounting and management system targeted towards
investment management organizations of all sizes. Axys provides investment
professionals with broad portfolio accounting functionality, timely decision
support, sophisticated performance measurement and flexible reporting.
Specifically, clients can record, account for and report on a variety of
investment instruments, including equities, fixed income, mutual funds and cash.
Axys users gain access on demand to portfolio holdings, asset allocation,
realized and unrealized gains and losses, actual and projected income and other
valuable data. Portfolio performance can be measured for individual portfolios
or related groups, and for any specified time period. Investment professionals
can choose from over 200 pre-defined reports with flexible "as of date"
reporting, which can be customized as to formats and fonts. In addition, clients
can easily generate fully customized reports with the assistance of Report
Writer Pro. Clients can also produce presentation-quality graphics via an
integrated link with Microsoft Excel's charting capability. Lastly, Axys offers
integrated multi-currency capabilities which, among other things, allows reports
to be restated in any currency, tracks reclaimable foreign withholding tax and
can identify components of return attributable to market prices versus currency
rate fluctuations.

         Axys also provides integration with a variety of investment tools and
data. These tools include (i) Moxy, our trade order management solution, (ii)
pricing, corporate actions, analytics and fundamental data via interfaces to
data vendors, (iii) automatic data entry and reconciliation of trades with
interfaces to the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC), brokerage firms
and custodians, (iv) integrating through the internet via our custodial data
service and software, (vi) internet reporting via Advent Browser Reporting for
Enterprise Users, our internet reporting service and (vii) data extracts in XML

sites.

         ADVENT PARTNER(R), introduced in December 1996, is a partnership
allocation system that integrates with both Axys and Geneva. This product is
specifically designed for hedge funds, fund administrators, prime brokers and
accounting firms that face the complex and time-consuming task of consistently
and accurately accounting for and reporting on partnerships and hedge funds. The
Windows-based system tracks partner-specific information and handles the
complexities of allocating realized and unrealized gains and losses for tax

integrated solution. Moxy supports fixed income, mutual funds and equity trading
and offers multi-currency capabilities. Moxy enables investment managers to
accurately adjust portfolio holdings, rebalance portfolios against models,
interactively assess "what-if" scenarios and automatically create orders to be
executed. For traders, Moxy tracks cash and positions during the trading day,
enables the accurate preparation of block trades and internal electronic trade
tickets, facilitates compliance with investment restrictions and trading
requirements and minimizes trading errors. Moxy also allows traders and others
to view the status of orders via customizable screens and maintain an electronic
audit trail of the trade process. Moxy automates the allocation process of
partial and complete executions and allows the user to send allocation results
using OASYS, an electronic allocation system, to communicate allocations to
brokers electronically. Moxy also provides internet-ready electronic order
routing based on the industry standard FIX messaging protocol so that Moxy users
can route trades electronically to any FIX-compliant broker or crossing network
that supports the internet or other TCP/IP connections. Moxy users can choose to
route equity orders via SunGard Direct(TM) which links them to participating
brokers and execution venues. Trades are executed, processed, settled and
accounted for without manual intervention. Moxy electronically posts allocated
trades into Axys on demand, eliminating time-consuming and error-prone manual
entry.

         QUBE(R), introduced in 1995, is designed to help securities
professionals develop and improve client relationships by automating scheduling,
tracking client communications and managing client data. Qube integrates with
portfolio information on Axys and enables investment professionals to
interactively screen client investment profiles and notes of conversations to
identify appropriate candidates for various investment opportunities. Qube
captures extensive investment profile information, has online query capability,
mail-merge capabilities and facilitates information sharing across professionals
in an office.

         REX(TM), introduced in 1997, is the Advent Office solution for
reconciliation management. REX is integrated with Axys and is designed for firms
that want to electronically reconcile their Axys information against their

communicate and track changes required by their custodian.

         MYADVENT(R), introduced in May 2000, provides a browser-based portal to
Advent Office allowing investment professionals to quickly view summary
information in order to know exactly where they stand at any point in the day.

Alliance Partner applications.

         ADVENT OUTSOURCE(SM), introduced in September 2000, is a service that

have the resources required to maintain technology operations in-house or are
looking specifically to outsource all of their data management.

         GIFTS(R), the windows-based application released in 1994, is a tracking
and grants management system that allows the user to retrieve and classify grant
proposals, generate personalized letters, manage contacts and reviews, schedule

philanthropic and grant-making communities, including foundations, corporations,
and government organizations, to manage their grant-making activities. The
Internet Grant Application Module (IGAM) allows grant seekers to submit online
grant applications and facilitates more efficient tracking and processing of
applications by the grant-maker. GIFTS Connections, an internet suite of modules
including MyGIFTS, ReviewerConnnect, and GranteeConnect, enables Web browser

wide, hosted, account consolidation and portfolio management platform for
independent broker-dealers, their financial advisors and the advisor's clients.

         management and performance reporting to financial planners and
         investment advisors. The system interfaces with most of the major
         custodians. Financial planners and advisors download their custodial
         information and then create a graphical report for their investors.
         Information can be viewed by client, account or at the transaction
         level.

              TRADER(TM), released in September 2000, is the trade system that
         allows users to generate trades and rebalance client portfolios to
         their model allocations.

              CONTACT(TM), released in May 2001, is a contact management system
         that allows advisors to track and manage client and prospect data.
         Users can also manage client documents such as financial plans and
         reports and track very specific client information such as income, tax
         bracket and other items that are important to their overall plan.

         WEB OFFICE(TM), released in May 2002, is a web-based system for
financial planners, investment advisors and smaller broker/dealers. With Web
Office, the firm hosts and manages their database in-house, but can also allow
external users dynamic access to their data. Administrative users at the firm
will download and reconcile account information for all clients, accounts and
transactions associated with their firm. All other users will then access the
system via the web and will be provided with dynamic account, performance and
transaction information.

DATA AND DATA INTEGRATION SERVICES

         ADVENT CUSTODIAL DATASM (ACD), introduced in 1997, provides data from a
firm's custodians in a single, secure account at Advent. Advent Custodial Data

allows a firm to further process the data against their own records.

         ADVENT TRUSTEDNETWORK(R), introduced in 2000, is an automated account
consolidation solution that enables investment professionals to generate
cross-institutional, consolidated reports for their clients. With Advent

Service provides 100% account coverage by combining Advent TrustedNetwork(R)
with Advent's high quality data management and account consolidation services.
Using Advent Wealth Service, and leveraging their existing portfolio reporting
and reconciliation solutions, clients can report on in-house managed accounts
and externally managed accounts, view complete asset allocation information, and
provide holistic advice to their clients.

         Advent's subscription-based and transaction-based services allow
clients to (1) download pricing, corporate actions and other data from third
party vendors such as Interactive Data Corporation and (2) interface with DTC,
certain brokerage firms and custodians for trading activity. Many of our clients
use our proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing

                                       7

and other data from Interactive Data. Interactive Data pays us a commission
based on Interactive Data's revenues from providing such data to our clients.

         Our Hub Data subsidiary consolidates securities information and data
from various third party providers such as Merrill Lynch, Interactive Data, J.J.
Kenny, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Xcitek, CCH Incorporated,
Telekurs and others, and provides data feeds and services to a range of
financial institutions via electronic interfaces to many portfolio software
systems.

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

         Professional services consist of consulting including implementation
management, integration management, custom report writing, and training. Many of
our clients purchase consulting services from us to support their
implementations, assist in the conversion of the clients' historical data and
provide ongoing training and education. Consulting services may be required for
as little as two days for small systems or for up to many weeks for large
implementations. We believe that consulting services facilitate a client's early
success with our products, strengthen the relationship with the client and
generate valuable feedback for us.

         IMPLEMENTATION MANAGEMENT provides a single point-of-contact who will
work closely with our client's project team to plan the implementation, to
optimize the use of our products, to coordinate Advent resources, to advocate on
their behalf, and to minimize schedule delays and project risks. Additionally,
implementation managers provide documentation for the implementation from
planning through production.

         INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT provides services to clients with multifaceted
needs. Integration Managers' work with clients to integrate Advent products with
their existing systems and workflows. The services include: development of
custom interfaces from back-office systems to our Axys and Moxy products,
configuration and management of large volumes of data, and strategies for
deployment of our products for distributed sites.

         CUSTOM REPORT WRITING SERVICES enable clients to tailor end-user
reports to their own specifications. We also provide training sessions to our
clients at various sites across the country.

         Additionally, we host semi-annual conferences in the United States, as
well as Australian and European conferences, that provide product information
and user workshops for our clients.

MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICES

         Due to the mission-critical nature of our products, many clients
purchase annual maintenance contracts, which entitle them to technical support
and product upgrades as they become available. We continually upgrade and
enhance our products to respond to changing market needs, evolving regulatory
requirements and new technologies.

ALLIANCE PROGRAM

         Our Alliance Program was launched in May 1998 and is designed to
benefit both our clients and our partners. The program provides a formal process
through which partners can develop, promote, and sell their products, services,
and solutions in conjunction with our suite of applications. Our Alliance
Program was created to further extend our breadth of product and service
offerings.

SALES AND MARKETING

         We license and sell our products and services primarily through a
direct sales organization comprised of field sales and telesales
representatives. Our field sales force is organized by geographic region and is
primarily responsible for selling our suite of products to medium and large
investment management organizations. We have sales offices in San Francisco,
California; New York, New York; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado;
Sydney and Melbourne, Australia; Oslo, Norway; Stockholm, Sweden; Copenhagen,
Denmark; and Athens, Greece. Our telesales organization is primarily focused on
selling our products to existing Axys clients and small and medium- sized
investment management


                                       8
<PAGE>

organizations. Our sales force is supported and enhanced by extensive, ongoing
product and sales training.

         Our marketing department is responsible for assessing market
opportunities, influencing product planning and management, providing guidance
to corporate development, and offering support to the sales organization. This
is all founded upon a rigorous process of market validation, through which we
survey, interview and synthesize information from prospects, existing clients,
product development, sales and our client services department to define the
scope, features and functionality of new products and product upgrades. In
addition, our product managers are responsible for all phases of a product life
cycle from product development through product introduction and beyond. Our
marketing department is also responsible for corporate marketing, including
generating client leads, targeted direct mail campaigns, seminars, advertising,
trade shows and conferences and public relations efforts and also provides the
sales force with appropriate written and electronic materials to use during the
sales process.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

         In recent years, we have substantially increased our product
development expenditures in order to accelerate the rate of new product
introductions, incorporate new technologies and sustain the quality of our
products. In 2002, 2001, and 2000, our product development expenditures were
approximately $39.6 million, $27.4 million, and $21.6 million respectively. Our
product development activities include the identification and validation of
product specifications as well as engineering, quality assurance and
documentation.

         Our new products and product upgrades require varying degrees of
development time, depending upon the complexity of the accounting requirements
and securities regulations which they are intended to address, as well as the
number and type of features incorporated. To date, we have primarily relied upon
the internal development of our products. We have in the past acquired, and may
again in the future acquire, additional technologies or products from third
parties. We intend to continue to support industry standard operating
environments, client/server architectures and network protocols.

COMPETITION

         The market for investment management software is divided by the
relative size of the organizations that manage and advise on investment
portfolios. The market is intensely competitive and highly fragmented, subject
to rapid change and extremely sensitive to new product introductions and
marketing efforts by industry participants. Our competitors include providers of
software and related services as well as providers of timeshare services.
Competitors vary in size, scope of services offered and platforms supported. In
addition, we compete indirectly with existing and potential clients, many of
whom develop their own software for their particular needs and therefore may be
reluctant to license software products offered by independent vendors such as
Advent. Our biggest competition comes from proprietary systems. Beyond that, we
compete against some of the following vendors: Financial Models Company, Inc.,
CheckFree Corporation, Schwab Performance Technologies, StatementOne, Inc.,
Eagle, a subsidiary of Mellon Financial Corporation, Thomson Financial,
Macgregor Financial Technologies, Charles River Development, Reuters Group PLC,
Bloomberg Tradebrook, LLC, Siebel Systems, Inc. and Sungard Data Systems, Inc.
We believe that the most predominant competitive differentiators are product
performance and functionality, ease of use, scalability, ability to integrate
external data sources, product and company reputation, client service and price.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

         Our success is dependent in part on our ability to protect our
proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright and trademark
laws, trade secrets, software security measures, confidentiality agreements and
license agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights and our
software. We have registered trademarks for many of our products and services
and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as
appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
employees and with our resellers and customers. Despite these efforts, it may be
possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products
or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information.
We do not have any patents, and existing copyright laws afford only limited
protection. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not develop
substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or that
equivalent products will not be marketed in competition with our products,
thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. Furthermore,
confidentiality agreements between us and our employees or any license
agreements with

                                       9
<PAGE>

our clients may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information
in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of it. In addition, the laws
of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as
do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to protect our
proprietary software in the United States or abroad against unauthorized third
party copying or use, which could significantly harm our business.

EMPLOYEES

         As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 981 employees on a full
time basis, including 131 in sales, 236 in professional services, 34 in
marketing, 275 in product development, 149 in client services and support and
156 in finance, administration, operations and general management. We believe
that we maintain competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation and
work environment policies to assist in attracting and retaining qualified
personnel. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued
contributions of our senior management and other key personnel, many of who
would be difficult to replace. The loss of the service of one or more senior
managers, or other employees could have a material adverse effect upon our
business, operating results and financial condition. None of our employees are
represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we
believe our employee relations are good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

         Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco,
California where we lease three separate facilities: approximately 59,000 square
feet under a lease that expires in 2008 with a five-year extension option;
approximately 50,400 square feet under leases that expire through 2006 with
five-year extension options; and 48,100 square feet under a lease that expires
in 2012 with a five year extension option. We lease five separate offices in New
York; approximately 30,100 square feet under a lease that expires in 2010 with a
five-year extension option; approximately 29,000 square feet under a lease that
expires in 2008 with a five-year extension option; approximately 19,000 square
feet under a lease that expires in 2006; approximately 17,300 square feet under
a lease that expires in 2008; and approximately 24,000 square feet under a lease
that expires in 2012. We also lease space (typically individually less than
12,000 square feet) in various geographic locations throughout the United
States; Sydney and Melbourne, Australia; Oslo, Norway; Stockholm, Sweden;
Copenhagen, Denmark; and Athens, Greece primarily for sales and support
personnel. We believe that these facilities are adequate for our near-term needs
and that suitable additional or alternative space will be available as needed.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         From time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the
conduct of our business. We are not party to any lawsuit or proceeding that, in
our opinion, is likely to seriously harm our business.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS

         None.

PART II

With the exception of the information incorporated by reference to the 2002
Annual Report to Stockholders in Part II of this Form 10-K, Advent's 2002 Annual
Report to Stockholders is not deemed to be filed as part of this Form 10-K.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDERS MATTERS

  We have approximately 70 stockholders of record at February 28, 2003. Because
many of our shares of Common Stock are held by brokers and other institutions on
behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of
stockholders represented by these record holders. Other information required by
this Item is incorporated by reference to the sections entitled "Selected
Financial Data - Price Range of Common Stock" and "Corporate Information - Stock
Information" in our 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders. The information required
by this item regarding equity compensation plans is incorporated by reference to
the information set forth in Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the
section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" in our 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders.

RISK FACTORS

         INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW BEFORE
MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. IN ADDITION, THESE RISKS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WE
FACE. ADDITIONAL RISKS WE ARE NOT PRESENTLY AWARE OF OR THAT WE CURRENTLY
BELIEVE ARE IMMATERIAL MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR BUSINESS
COULD BE HARMED BY ANY OF THESE RISKS. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK
COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN
OUR HISTORICAL GROWTH RATES.

         Licenses into multi-user networked environments have increased both in
individual size and number, and the timing and size of individual license
transactions are becoming increasingly important factors in quarterly operating
results. The sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and
unpredictable. We may not be successful in closing large license transactions
such as these on a timely basis or at all. Accordingly, because revenues from
large licenses may increase as a portion of our net revenues, the timing of such
licenses could cause additional variability in our quarterly operating results.
Software product backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents
only a small portion of that quarter's expected revenues. Our expense levels are
based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and therefore
are relatively fixed in the short term. Due to the fixed nature of these
expenses combined with the relatively high gross margin historically achieved on
products and services, an unanticipated decline in net revenues in any
particular quarter is likely to disproportionately adversely affect our
operating results. We have often recognized a substantial portion of each
quarter's license revenues in the last month, weeks or even days of that
quarter. As a result, the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations in revenue or
earnings may not be evident until late in or after the close of a particular
quarter and a disruption late in the quarter may have a disproportionately large
negative impact on our quarterly results. These factors impacted our results in
the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002 and may continue to impact
our results. Additionally, in June 2002, we announced that we would begin to
offer term licenses as an alternative to the perpetual licenses we have
previously sold. Although we believe that this will give us more predictable
revenue over time , it may potentially decrease revenues in the short-term as
some clients make the shift from perpetual to term and as a result we recognize
less revenue at the beginning of the contract.

         Because of the above factors, we believe that period-to-period
comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that
these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.

OUR STOCK PRICE HAS FLUCTUATED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
IN NOVEMBER 1995.

         Like many companies in the technology and emerging growth sector, our
stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations, particularly during times of
high market volatility. If net revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet
the investment community's expectations, our stock price is likely to decline.
In addition, our stock price may be affected by trends in the financial services
sector and by broader market trends unrelated to our performance.

OUR SALES CYCLE IS LONG AND WE HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO FORECAST THE TIMING AND
AMOUNT OF SPECIFIC SALES.

         Because the purchase of our software products often requires
significant, executive-level investment and systems architecture decisions by
prospective customers, we must generally engage in a relatively lengthy sales
effort. These transactions may be delayed during the customer decision process
because we must provide a significant level of education to prospective
customers regarding the use and benefit of our products. As a result, the sales
cycle associated with the purchase of our software products is typically between
two and twelve months depending upon the size of the client, and it can be
considerably longer, and is subject to a number of significant risks over which
we have little or no control, including customers' budgeting constraints and
internal selection procedures, among others. As a result of a lengthy and
unpredictable sales cycle, we have limited ability to forecast the timing and
amount of specific sales. The timing of large individual sales is especially
difficult to forecast. Therefore there can be no assurance that we will be
successful in closing large license


                                       15
<PAGE>

transactions on a timely basis or at all. In addition, customers may postpone
their purchases of our existing products or product enhancements in advance of
the anticipated introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or
our competitors or due to economic conditions. Because our expenses are
generally relatively fixed in the near term, any shortfall from anticipated
revenues could result in a significant variation in our operating results from
quarter to quarter.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON OUR PRODUCT, AXYS.

         In 2002, 2001 and 2000, we derived a majority of our net revenues from
the licensing of Axys, part of our Advent Office suite, and related applications
and services. In addition, many of our other applications, such as Moxy, Qube
and various data interfaces were designed to operate with Axys to provide an
integrated solution. As a result, we believe that a majority of our net
revenues, for the foreseeable future will depend upon continued market
acceptance of Axys, enhancements or upgrades to Axys and related products and
services. As our clients include a range of organizations including asset
managers, investment advisors, brokerage firms, hedge funds, family offices,
banks and trusts and others, the degree of continued market acceptance will also
depend on the number of firms within each of the categories and the degree to
which Axys previously penetrated those firms.

WE DEPEND UPON FINANCIAL MARKETS.

         The target clients for our products include a range of organizations
that manage investment portfolios, including investment advisors, brokerage
firms, banks and hedge funds. In addition, we target corporations, public funds,
universities and non-profit organizations, which also manage investment
portfolios and have many of the same needs. The success of many of our clients
is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets. We believe that
demand for our products could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations,
disruptions, instability or downturns in the financial markets which may cause
clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce
any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software
products. In addition, a slowdown in formation of new investment firms or a
decline in the growth of assets under management would cause a decline in demand
for our products. We believe that the economic downturn in the financial markets
negatively impacted the demand for our products in the second, third and fourth
quarters of fiscal 2002, and that a continuing downturn could have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING OUR ACQUISITIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS
AND WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS OR
DIVESTITURES.

         In 2001, we completed acquisitions of Rex Development Partners, L.P.,
NPO Solutions, Inc., certain assets of ManagerLink.com LLC and our Scandinavian
distributors located in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. In 2002, we completed the
acquisition of Kinexus Corporation, Techfi Corporation, our Greek distributor
Advent Hellas and Advent Outsource Data Management, LLC. Our acquisition of
Kinexus Corporation is our largest acquisition to date, and the number of
acquisitions completed in 2001 and 2002 was unprecedented.

         The complex process of integrating Kinexus and our other acquisitions
has required and will continue to require significant resources, particularly in
light of our relative inexperience in integrating acquisitions. Integrating
these acquisitions has been and will continue to be time consuming, expensive
and disruptive to our business. This integration process has strained our
managerial controls, and has resulted in the diversion of management and
financial resources from our core business objectives. Failure to achieve the
anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or to successfully integrate the
operations of these entities could harm our business, results of operations and
cash flows. We may not realize the benefits we anticipate from these
acquisitions because of the following significant challenges:

         o    expected synergy benefits from these acquisitions, such as lower
              costs or increased revenues, may not be realized or may be
              realized more slowly than anticipated, particularly with regard to
              costs associated with a reduction in headcount and facilities;

         o    potentially incompatible cultural differences between the
              companies;

         o    incorporating these companies' technologies and products into our
              current and future product lines;


                                       16
<PAGE>

         o    geographic dispersion of operations and the complexities of
              international operations;

         o    integrating the technical teams of these companies with our
              engineering organizations;

         o    generating market demand for an expanded product line;

         o    integrating the products of these companies with our business,
              because we do not have distribution, manufacturing, marketing or
              support experience for these products;

         o    the difficulty of leveraging our combined technologies and
              capabilities across all product lines and customer bases; and

         o    our inability to retain previous customers or employees of these
              entities.

         We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and
commit significant management time in integrating the operations, technology,
development programs, products, information systems, customers and personnel of
these acquisitions. These costs have been and will likely continue to be
substantial and include costs for:

         o    integrating and reorganizing operations, including combining
              teams, facilities and processes in various functional areas;

         o    identifying duplicative or redundant resources and facilities,
              developing plans for resource consolidation and implementing
              those plans;

         o    fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in
              completing the integration process;

         o    settling existing liabilities of these companies;

         o    uncovering through our audit process new issues reflected on the
              companies' financial statements;

         o    costs associated with vacating, subleasing and closing facilities;

         o    employee relocation, redeployment or severance costs;

         o    integrating technology and products; and

         o    other transaction costs associated with the acquisition, including
              financial advisor, attorney, accountant and exchange agent fees.

         We may make additional acquisitions of complementary companies,
products or technologies in the future, which would further exacerbate these
issues. In addition, we continually evaluate the performance of all our products
and product lines and may sell or discontinue current products or product lines.
Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any future acquisition or
divestiture could also harm our business, results of operations and cash flows.
Furthermore, we may have to incur debt, write-off investments, infrastructure
costs or other assets, incur severance liabilities, write-off impaired goodwill
or other intangible assets or issue equity securities to pay for any future
acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing
stockholders' ownership. Finally, we may not identify suitable businesses to
acquire or negotiate acceptable terms for acquisitions.

DIFFICULTIES WE MAY ENCOUNTER MANAGING A SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER BUSINESS COULD
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

         Our business has grown in recent years through both internal expansion
and acquisitions, and that growth along with any continued growth may cause a
significant strain on our infrastructure, internal systems and managerial
resources. For example, during 2001 and 2002, we acquired Rex Development
Partners, L.P., NPO Solutions, Inc., certain assets of


                                       17
<PAGE>
ManagerLink.com LLC, our Scandinavian and Greek distributors (located in Norway,
Sweden, Denmark and Greece), Kinexus Corporation, Techfi Corporation and Advent
Outsource Data Management, LLC. Further, our headcount increased from 481
employees at December 31, 1998 to 981 at December 31, 2002. To manage our growth
effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our infrastructure,
including operating and administrative systems and controls, and continue
managing headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner. Our
productivity and the quality of our products may be adversely affected if we do
not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively and coordinate
among our executive, engineering, finance, marketing, sales, operations and
customer support organizations, all of which add to the complexity of our
organization and increase our operating expenses. In addition, our revenues may
not grow at a sufficient rate to absorb the costs associated with a larger
overall headcount. Integrating our recent acquisitions will complicate these
tasks.

WRITING OFF INVESTMENTS COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

         In addition, we have made investments in privately held companies,
which we classify as "other assets" on our balance sheet. The value of these
investments is influenced by many factors, including the operating effectiveness
of these companies, the overall health of these companies' industries, the
strength of the private equity markets and general market conditions. Due to
these and other factors, we have previously determined, and may in the future
determine, that the value of these investments is impaired, which has caused and
would cause us to write down the stated value of these investments such as the
write-off of our investments in Encompys and MyCFO during 2002. Furthermore, we
cannot be sure that future investment, license, fixed asset or other asset
write-downs will not happen, particularly if the current economic downturn
continues. If future write-downs do occur, they could harm our business and
results of operations.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES.

         We believe that the market for large investment management software
systems may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including reductions
in capital expenditures by large customers; poor performance of major financial
markets, and increasing competition. Those factors may, in turn, give rise to a
number of market trends, which we experienced in the second, third and fourth
quarters of fiscal 2002, that may slow revenue growth across the industry,
including longer sales cycles, deferral or delay of information technology
projects and generally reduced expenditures for software and related services,
and increased price competition. If the current economic slowdown continues, the
presence of these factors in the market for large investment management software
systems will likely materially adversely affect our business and results of
operations.

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

         Our operations are exposed to interruption by fire, earthquake, power
loss, telecommunications failure, and other events beyond our control.
Additionally, we are vulnerable to interruption caused by political and
terrorist incidents. For example, our facilities in New York were temporarily
closed due to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Immediately after the
terrorist attacks, our clients who were located in the World Trade Center area
were concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional
software components, while the grounding of transportation impeded our ability
to deliver professional services at client sites. Additionally, during the
temporary closure of the U.S. stock markets, our clients did not use our market
data services. Such interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver
products and services and other critical functions of our business and could
seriously harm us. Further, such attacks could cause instability in the
financial markets upon which we depend.

WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR INTERNET BASED ENABLED SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS ADVENT
TRUSTEDNETWORK AND WEALTHLINE.

         To take advantage of the internet, we are continuing to develop
solutions to bring internet-based products and services to our clients. As we
develop these new products and services, we have entered, and will continue to
enter, into development agreements and other agreements with information
providers, clients or other companies in order to accelerate the delivery of new
products and services, such as our relationship with Microsoft for WealthLine.
We may not be successful in marketing our internet services or in developing
other internet services or maintaining these relationships. Internet-based
products contain certain unique technical challenges, such as scalability and
latency requirements, that we may not be

                                       18
<PAGE>

successful in solving, and if we cannot successfully overcome such challenges
our products may fail. Additionally, we may not be successful in being able to
replace our current technology with new technology. Our failure to do so could
seriously harm our business. In addition, we cannot assure you that there will
not be disruptions in internet services beyond our control or that of our third
party vendors. Any such disruptions could harm our business.

SECURITY RISKS AND CONCERNS MAY DETER THE USE OF THE INTERNET FOR CONDUCTING
BUSINESS.

         A significant barrier to commerce and communications over public
networks is the secure transmission of confidential information. Advances in
computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other
events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security
systems or those of other web sites to protect proprietary information. If any
well-publicized compromises of security were to occur, it could have the effect
of substantially reducing the use of the internet for commerce and
communications. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or
operations. The internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network
from many sources. In the past, computer viruses, software programs that disable
or impair computers, have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the
internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our
customers or other third parties, which could disrupt or make it inaccessible to
customers. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources
to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems
caused by breaches. To the extent that our activities may involve the storage
and transmission of proprietary information, security breaches could expose us
to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our security measures
may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business would be harmed
if our security were breached.

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO OUR NEW BUSINESS AREAS.

         We have expanded in recent periods into a number of new business areas
to foster long-term growth including international operations, strategic
alliances, and Advent TrustedNetwork. These areas are still relatively new to
our product development and sales personnel. New business areas require
significant management time and resources prior to generating significant
revenues and may divert management from our core business. There is no assurance
that we will compete effectively or will generate significant revenues in these
areas. The success of our ability to develop and market new internet based
products and services, such as Advent TrustedNetwork and WealthLine, is
difficult to predict because it represents a new area of business for our entire
industry. While our traditional offerings are marketed to investment managers
and advisors, certain of our new offerings are also targeted for use by our
clients' customers. We may have difficulty creating demand from our clients'
customers as we market to them indirectly through our clients. Revenue growth
may suffer if we cannot create demand among our client's customers. Also, we
have recently entered into new markets through our acquisitions, and we may not
be successful in competing in those areas. Additionally, to help manage our
growth, we will need to continually improve our operational, financial,
management and information systems and controls.

WE EXPECT OUR GROSS AND OPERATING MARGINS MAY FLUCTUATE OVER TIME.

         We expect that our gross and operating margins may fluctuate from
period to period as we continue to introduce new products, change our
professional services organization and associated revenue, continue to hire and
acquire additional personnel and increase other expenses to support our
business. Because these expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, a
fluctuation in revenue could lead to operating results differing from
expectations.

WE MUST CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS.

         The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological
change, changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards. As a
result, our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop
new products or product enhancements that address the future needs of our target
markets and to respond to these changing standards and practices. We may not be
successful in developing, introducing and marketing new products or product
enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis, or at all, and our new
products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of
the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. Delays in the commencement of
commercial shipments of new products or enhancements may result in client
dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues. If we are unable, for
technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products or
enhancements of existing products in a timely

                                       19
<PAGE>

manner in response to changing market conditions or client requirements, or if
new products or new versions of existing products do not achieve market
acceptance, our business would be seriously harmed. In addition, our ability to
develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of
other software vendors, including certain system software vendors, such as
Microsoft Corporation, database vendors and development tool vendors. If the
products of such vendors have design defects or flaws, or if such products are
unexpectedly delayed in their introduction, our business could be seriously
harmed. Our software products are complex and may contain undetected defects or
errors when first introduced or as new versions are released. Although we have
not experienced adverse effects resulting from any software errors, we cannot be
sure that despite testing by us and our clients, defects or errors will not be
found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in
loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

IF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH INTERACTIVE DATA CORPORATION IS TERMINATED, OUR
BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED.

         Many of our clients use our proprietary interface to electronically
retrieve pricing and other data from Interactive Data Corporation. Interactive
Data Corporation pays us a commission based on their revenues from providing
this data to our clients. Our software products have been customized to be
compatible with their system and this software would need to be redesigned if
their services were unavailable for any reason. Termination of our agreement
with Interactive Data Corporation would require at least two years notice by
either us or them, or 90 days in the case of material breach. If our
relationship with Interactive Data Corporation were terminated or their services
were unavailable to our clients for any reason, replacing these services could
be costly and time consuming.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

         The market for investment management software is intensely competitive
and highly fragmented; is subject to rapid change and is extremely sensitive to
new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants. Our
competitors include providers of software and related services as well as
providers of timeshare services, and include some of the following vendors:
Financial Models Company, Inc., CheckFree Corporation Schwab Performance
Technologies, StatementOne, Inc., Eagle, a subsidiary of Mellon Financial
Corporation, Thomson Financial, Macgregor Financial Technologies ,Charles River
Development, Reuters Group PLC, Bloomberg Tradebrook, LLC, Siebel Systems, Inc.
and Sungard Data Systems, Inc. We experience significant competition from
proprietary systems.

         Our competitors vary in size, scope of services offered and platforms
supported. In addition, we compete indirectly with existing and potential
clients, many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and
therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by independent
vendors like Advent. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and
greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do. In
addition, we also face competition from potential new entrants into our market
that may develop innovative technologies or business models. We cannot guarantee
that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future
competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in price reductions,
reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which could
seriously harm our business.

WE FACE CHALLENGES IN EXPANDING OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

         We market and sell our products in the United States and, to a lesser
extent, internationally. In November 1998, we purchased an independent
distributor in Australia, which markets and licenses our products in Australia.
In addition, we entered into a distributor relationship in 1999 with Advent
Europe, an independent distributor of our products in selected European markets.
In November 2001, we acquired the Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish companies of
this independent distributor and in September 2002, we purchased their Greek
subsidiary. In order to further expand our international operations, we will
need to continue to establish additional locations, acquire other businesses or
enter into additional distribution relationships in other parts of the world.
The expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional
international markets will require significant management attention and
financial resources. We cannot be certain that establishing new business in
other countries will produce the desired levels of revenue. We currently have
limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and
marketing and distributing our products internationally. In addition,
international operations are subject to other inherent risks, including:


                                       20
<PAGE>

         o    The impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;

         o    Greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer
              collection periods;

         o    Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

         o    Difficulties in successfully adapting our products to the
              language, regulatory and technology standards of other countries;

         o    Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign
              operations;

         o    Reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some
              countries;

         o    Potentially adverse tax consequences; and

         o    Political and economic instability.

         The revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of our international
subsidiaries are primarily denominated in local currencies. We have not
historically undertaken foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover potential
foreign currency exposure. Future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may
adversely affect revenues from international sales and the U.S. dollar value of
our foreign subsidiaries' revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Our
international revenues from our distributors are generally denominated in local
foreign currencies.

UNDETECTED SOFTWARE ERRORS OR FAILURES FOUND IN NEW PRODUCTS MAY RESULT IN LOSS
OF OR DELAY IN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR
BUSINESS.

         Our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when
first introduced or as new versions are released. Despite testing by us and by
current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products until
after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or a delay in
market acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO
INCREASED COMPETITION THAT COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

         Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology. We
currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets,
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary
rights. We have registered trademarks for many of our products and services and
will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as
appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
employees and with our resellers and customers. We seek to protect our software,
documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws,
which afford only limited protection. Despite these efforts, it may be possible
for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. We do
not have any patents, and existing copyright laws afford only limited
protection. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not develop
substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or that
equivalent products will not be marketed in competition with our products,
thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. We cannot be
sure that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are
patentable, that any patent, if issued, would provide us with any competitive
advantages or would not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of
others will not adversely affect our ability to do business. Litigation may be
necessary to protect our proprietary technology. This litigation may be
time-consuming and expensive. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to
obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws
of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an
extent as do the laws of the United States. We cannot be sure that our means of
protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will
not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design
around any patent that may be issued to us or other intellectual property rights
of ours.


                                       21
<PAGE>

WE MUST RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES AND RECRUIT QUALIFIED TECHNICAL AND SALES
PERSONNEL.

         We believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of
our senior management and key technical personnel, none of whom has an
employment agreement with us. Additionally, our continued success depends, in
part, on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified
technical, sales and other personnel. Because our future success is dependent on
our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are
particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain
qualified engineers with the requisite education, backgrounds and industry
experience. Competition for qualified engineers, particularly in Northern
California and the San Francisco Bay Area, is intense. The loss of the services
of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to
our development efforts or business relationships and could seriously harm our
business. We may also be required to create additional performance and retention
incentives in order to retain our employees, including the granting of
additional stock options to employees at current prices or issuing incentive
cash bonuses. Such incentives may either dilute our existing stockholder base or
result in unforeseen operating expenses, which may cause our stock price to
fall.

INFORMATION WE PROVIDE TO INVESTORS IS ACCURATE ONLY AS OF THE DATE WE
DISSEMINATE IT.

         From time to time, we may publicly disseminate forward- looking
information or guidance in compliance with Regulation FD promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. This information or guidance represents our
outlook only as of the date we disseminate it.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

         We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates. Much of our revenue and capital
spending is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, since the acquisitions of
Advent Australia, Advent Denmark, Advent Norway, Advent Sweden and Advent
Hellas, whose revenues and capital spending are transacted in local country
currencies, we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Results
of operations from Advent Australia, Advent Denmark, Advent Norway, Advent
Sweden and Advent Hellas are not material to our operating results; therefore,
we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially adversely
affect our overall financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

         We believe that the fair value of our investment portfolio or related
income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest
rates due mainly to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio. However,
immediate sharp increases in interest rates could have a material adverse affect
on the fair value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, immediate sharp
declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our
investment portfolio.

U.S. dollars) and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity
for our investment portfolio (in thousands):

         At December 31, 2002, cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable
securities totaled approximately $173.8 million, which is comprised of the
$147.5 million in our investment portfolio, presented above, and $26.3 million
in other cash and cash equivalents.

         We also invested in several privately held companies, most of which can
still be considered in the start-up or development stages and are classified as
"other assets" on our balance sheet. In 2002 we purchased approximately 15% of
the outstanding stock of LatentZero Limited ("LatentZero"), a privately held
company located in England. Our investment in LatentZero totaled approximately
$7 million and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting because
the Chairman of our Board of Directors is a member of LatentZero's Board of
Directors. Our portion of the net income or losses for this investment has not
been significant to date. At December 31, 2002 our net investments in privately
held companies including LatentZero were $11 million. These investments are
inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under
development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. The
value of these investments is influenced by many factors, including the
operating effectiveness of these companies, the overall health of the companies'
industries, the strength of the private equity markets and general market
conditions. We could lose our entire initial investment in these companies.

ITEM 14. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

         Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Annual Report on Form
10-K (the "Evaluation Date"), we evaluated, under the supervision of our chief
executive officer and our chief financial officer, the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required
to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS.

         Our review of our internal controls was made within the context of the
relevant professional auditing standards defining "internal controls,"
"significant deficiencies," and "material weaknesses." "Internal controls" are
processes designed to provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are
properly authorized, our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper
use, and our transactions are properly recorded and reported, all to permit the
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. "Significant deficiencies" are referred to as "reportable
conditions," or control issues that could have a significant adverse effect on
the ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data in the
financial statements. A "material weakness" is a particularly serious reportable
condition where the internal control does not reduce to a relatively low level
the risk that misstatements caused by error or fraud may occur in amounts that
would be material in relation to the financial statements and not be detected
within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their
assigned functions. As part of our internal controls procedures, we also address
other, less significant control matters that we or our auditors identify, and we
determine what revision or improvement to make, if any, in accordance with our
on-going procedures.

         Subsequent to the Evaluation Date, there were no significant changes in
our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect our
internal controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses.

     committee of registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
     equivalent functions):

     a)   all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
          controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
          identified for the registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in
          internal controls; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls; and

6.   The registrant's other certifying officer and I have indicated in this
     annual report whether there were significant changes in internal controls
     or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including any
     corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
     weaknesses.

     1.1 REGISTERED OFFICE

     The registered office of the corporation shall be in the City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware. The name of the registered
agent of the corporation at such location is The Corporation Trust Company.

offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do
business.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

     2.1 PLACE OF MEETINGS

     Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the
State of Delaware designated by the board of directors. The board of directors
may, in its sole discretion, determine that a meeting of stockholders shall not
be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote
communication as authorized by Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall
be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.

     2.2 ANNUAL MEETING

     The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at
a time designated by the board of directors. In the absence of such designation,
the annual meeting of stockholders

<PAGE>

shall be held on the second Friday in June in each year at 10:00 a.m. However,
if such day falls on a legal holiday, then the meeting shall be held at the same
time and place on the next succeeding full business day. At the meeting,
directors shall be elected, and any other proper business may be transacted.

     2.3 SPECIAL MEETING

     A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the
board of directors, or by the chairman of the board, the chief executive
officer, or the president.

     2.4 NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

     All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in
accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor
more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall
specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to
be present in person and vote at such meeting and (i) in the case of a special
meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business
other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case
of the annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time
of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any
proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action). The notice of
any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any
nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present
for election.

     2.5 ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES AND STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS

             (a) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business
shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be
properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (i) specified in
the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction
of the board of directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by
or at the direction of the board of directors, or (iii) otherwise properly
brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given
timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be
timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at
the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred
twenty (120) calendar days before the one year anniversary of the date on which
the corporation first mailed its proxy statement to stockholders in connection
with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders. A stockholder's notice
to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to
bring before the annual meeting: (A) a brief description of the business desired
to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such
business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and address, as they appear on the
corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (C) the class
and number of shares of the corporation that are beneficially owned by the
stockholder, (D) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and
(E) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder
pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities


                                       2
<PAGE>

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in his capacity as a proponent to a
stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include
information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and
form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as
required by the regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no
business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this paragraph (a). The chairman of the annual meeting
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business
was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the
provisions of this paragraph (a), and, if he should so determine, he shall so
declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the
meeting shall not be transacted.

             (b) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this paragraph (b) shall be eligible for election as
directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the
corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of
the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote
in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice
procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). Such nominations, other than those
made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made pursuant to
timely notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with
the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. Such stockholder's notice
shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to
nominate for election or re-election as a director: (A) the name, age, business
address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or
employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation
that are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all
arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any
other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the
nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information
relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of
proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case
pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in
the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if
elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information
required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 2.5. At the
request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for
election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that
information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination
which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a
director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this paragraph (b). The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts
warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in
accordance with the procedures prescribed by these bylaws, and if he should so
determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination
shall be disregarded.

     These provisions shall not prevent the consideration and approval or
disapproval at an annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and
committees of the board of directors, but in connection therewith no new
business shall be acted upon at any such meeting unless stated, filed and
received as herein provided. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the
contrary, no business brought


                                       3
<PAGE>

before a meeting by a stockholder shall be conducted at an annual meeting except
in accordance with procedures set forth in this Section 2.5.

     2.6 MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE

     Written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given either (i)
personally, (ii) by private courier, (iii) by first or third-class United States
mail, (iv) by other written communication, or (v) by other electronic or
wireless means. Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid
and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder
appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the
corporation for the purpose of notice. Notice shall be deemed to have been given
at the time when delivered personally or by courier or deposited in the mail or
sent by other means of written communication or other electronic or wireless
means.

     An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any
stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary or an assistant secretary, or
of any transfer agent or any other agent of the corporation giving the notice,
shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.

     2.7 QUORUM

     The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the
transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the
certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of
the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance
with Section 2.8 of these bylaws.

     When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a
majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by
proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question
is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or
of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a different vote is
required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the
decision of the question.

     If a quorum be initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact
business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a
majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.

     2.8 ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE

     When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless these bylaws
otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time
and place, if any, thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by
which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any
business


                                       4

without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing setting forth the action so
taken shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than
the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present

     For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any

the books of the corporation after the record date.

     If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held.

     A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote
at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting

but the board of directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is
adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original
meeting.

a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the
corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3)
years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy
shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether
by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, telefacsimile or
otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The
revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware.

     2.13 ORGANIZATION

     The chairman of the board, or in the absence of the chairman, the
president, shall call the meeting of the stockholders to order, and shall act as
chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the chairman of the board, the
president, and all of the vice presidents, the stockholders shall appoint a
chairman for such meeting. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall
determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including
such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of
business. The secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all
meetings of the stockholders, but in the absence of the secretary at any meeting

     2.14 LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE

complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The corporation shall not
be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact
information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business
hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (i) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required
to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii)
during ordinary business hours, at the corporation's principal executive office.
In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an
electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that
such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at
the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely
by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the
examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access
such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. The stock ledger
shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine
the stock

     2.15 INSPECTORS OF ELECTION

     Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an
inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If
no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may,
and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an
inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of
inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at
a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies,
then the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares or their proxies
present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors
are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or
fails or refuses to act, then the chairperson of the meeting may, and upon the
request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to
fill that vacancy.

     Such inspectors shall:

             (i)   determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting
power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of
a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;

            (ii)   receive votes, ballots or consents;

           (iii)   hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way
arising in connection with the right to vote;

            (iv)   count and tabulate all votes or consents;

             (v)   determine when the polls shall close;

            (vi)   determine the result; and

           (vii)   do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election
or vote with fairness to all stockholders.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                    DIRECTORS

     3.1 POWERS

     Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and to
any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to
action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares,
the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate
powers shall be


                                       7
<PAGE>

exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.

     3.2 NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

     The board of directors shall consist of six (6) members. The number of
directors may be changed by an amendment to this bylaw, duly adopted by the
board of directors or by the stockholders, or by a duly adopted amendment to the
certificate of incorporation.

     3.3 ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS

     Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be
elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next
annual meeting. Each director, including a director elected or appointed to fill
a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected
and until a successor has been elected and qualified. Directors need not be
stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws. The certificate of incorporation or these bylaws may prescribe other
qualifications for directors.

     3.4 RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES

     Any director may resign effective on giving notice in writing or by
electronic transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, the
secretary or the board of directors, unless the notice specifies a later time
for that resignation to become effective. If the resignation of a director is
effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take
office when the resignation becomes effective.

     Vacancies in the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the
remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of
the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which
a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a
majority of the required quorum). Each director so elected shall hold office
until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been
elected and qualified.

     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws:

             (i)   Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the
stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a
majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a
sole remaining director.

            (ii)   Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or
series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of
the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of
such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the


                                       8
<PAGE>

directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or
by a sole remaining director so elected.

     If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the
corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any
stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder,
or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate
of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with
the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply
to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided
in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

     If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship,
the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board
(as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of
Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at
least ten(10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding
having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be
held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace
the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which
election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.

     3.5 REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

     Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation
or by these bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors may be
removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then
entitled to vote at an election of directors.

corporation.

     Any meeting of the board, regular or special, may be held by conference
telephone or similar communication equipment, so long as all directors
participating in the meeting can hear one another; and all such participating
directors shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

     3.7 FIRST MEETINGS

     The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors shall be held at
such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the
annual meeting. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time
or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in
the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the
stockholders,


                                       9

for the transaction of business, except to adjourn as provided in Section 3.12

     Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director (i)who signs a waiver
of notice, whether before or after the meeting, or (ii)who attends the meeting

to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. All such waivers shall be filed with the corporate records or made
part of the minutes of the meeting. A waiver of notice need not specify the

                INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES
                                AND OTHER AGENTS

     6.1 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

     The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by
the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter
be amended, indemnify any person against expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit,
or proceeding in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made
a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer
of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer"
of the corporation shall mean any person (i) who is or was a director or officer
of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation
as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a
corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another
enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

     The corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in
connection with an action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such director or officer only if the initiation of such action, suit, or
proceeding (or part thereof) by the director or officer was authorized by the
board of Directors of the corporation.

     The corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred
by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification
hereunder in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in this
Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment
of expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in advance of
the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts
advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the director or officer is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.

     The rights conferred on any person by this Article shall not be exclusive
of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these
bylaws, agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise.

     Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article
shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in
respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or
modification.


                                       17
<PAGE>

     6.2 INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS

     The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the
manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now
exists or may hereafter be amended, to indemnify any person (other than
directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in
connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or
proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of
the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of
the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who
is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an
employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the
corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor
corporation.

     6.3 INSURANCE

     The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred
by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,
whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her
against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware.

     6.4 SAVINGS CLAUSE

     If this Article VI or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any
ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation against expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, and whether internal
or external, including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by
or in the right of the corporation, to the full extent permitted by any
applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated, or by
any other applicable law.

     6.5 CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

     The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VI shall, unless otherwise prided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

     6.6 NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS

     The rights conferred on any person by this bylaw shall not be exclusive of
any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.
The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts
with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the
General Corporation Law of Delaware.

     6.7 AMENDMENTS

     Any repeal or modification of this bylaw shall only be prospective and
shall not affect the rights under this bylaw in effect at the time of the
alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any
proceeding against any agent of the corporation.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                               RECORDS AND REPORTS

     7.1 MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS

     The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such
place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its
stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of
shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date,
accounting books and other records of its business and properties.

     Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall,
upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right
during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the
corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and
records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a
purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every
instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to
inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or
such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on
behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the
corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of
business.

     7.2 INSPECTION BY DIRECTORS

     Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock
ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose

     7.3 REPRESENTATION OF SHARES OF OTHER CORPORATIONS

     The chairman of the board, if any, the chief executive officer, the
president, any vice president, the chief financial officer, the secretary or any
assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the
board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote,
represent and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any
and all shares of the stock of any other corporation or corporations standing in
the name of this corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised
either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by
proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.

     7.4 CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF BYLAWS

     The original or a copy of these bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered to

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                 GENERAL MATTERS

     8.1 RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING

     For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of
any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the
stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and
which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action. In that
case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed
are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to
exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any
shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as
otherwise provided by law.

     If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record
date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable
resolution.

     8.2 CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS

     From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution
which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for
payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in
the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized
shall sign or endorse those instruments.


                                       20
<PAGE>

     8.3 FISCAL YEAR

     The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the
board of directors.

     8.4 CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS: HOW EXECUTED

     The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may
authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into
any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the
corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific
instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within
the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any
power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to
pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.

     8.5 STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES

     The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates,
provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by
resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of
its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to
shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of
directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request,
every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate
signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman
of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the
treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary
of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate
form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In
case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer,
transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued
by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer,
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

     Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of
directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the
shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares
for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers,
designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights,
if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of
restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as
to any applicable voting trust agreement; if the shares be assessable, or, if
assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.

     Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a
certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of
succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the
corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel
the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.


                                       21
<PAGE>

     The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly
paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid
therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent
any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in
the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the
consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.
Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall
declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the
basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

     8.6 SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES

     If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or
more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the
preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall
issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that,
except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the
face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent
such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish
without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations,
the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special
rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

     8.7 LOST CERTIFICATES

     Except as provided in this Section 8.7, no new certificates for shares
shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is
surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The board of
directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other
security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement
certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board
may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other
adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that
may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the
replacement certificate.

     8.8 TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS

     The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer
clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank
or trust company -- either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such
times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the
board of directors may designate.

     8.9 CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS

     Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of
construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall
govern the construction of these


                                       22

bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these
bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the
singular, and the term "person" includes both an entity and a natural person.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   AMENDMENTS


     The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or
repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the
corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt,
amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so
conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor
limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.

     Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the
book of bylaws with the original bylaws, in the appropriate place. If any bylaw
is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal
was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in
said book.

SELECTED PORTIONS OF ADVENT'S 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

                SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



       You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion
contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 as amended. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
terminology such as "may", "will", "should", "expect", "plan" "anticipate",
"believe", "estimate", "predict", "potential", "continue" or other similar terms
and the negative of such terms and include statements about our products and
expected financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are based on our
current plans and expectations and involve known and unknown risks and
uncertainties which may cause our actual results or performance to be materially
different from any results or performance expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the
"Risk Factors" set forth below as well as other risks identified from time to
time in other SEC reports. You should not place undue reliance on our
forward-looking statements, as they are not guarantees of future results, levels
of activity or performance and represent our expectations only as of the date
they are made.


       We are a leading provider of Enterprise Investment Management solutions
that automate and integrate mission-critical functions of investment management
organizations through software products, data integration and professional
services. Our solutions enable organizations of all sizes to run their business
more effectively, enhance client service and performance, and improve
productivity and communication throughout the entire organization.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

       Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments,
including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets,
intangible assets and goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

       We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.


       REVENUE RECOGNITION AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - We recognize
revenue from the license of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed and determinable and
collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. We use a signed
license agreement as evidence of an arrangement. Sales through our distributors
are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with
binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor's customers.
Delivery occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier F.O.B shipping
point. Our arrangements do not generally include acceptance provisions, yet if
acceptance provisions are provided, delivery occurs upon acceptance. We assess
whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated
with the transaction. Fees are fixed and determinable when we have sufficient
history of collection under the payment terms. We assess whether collection of
the fee is reasonably assured based on a number of factors, including past
transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the

customer. Our arrangements for software licenses are sold with maintenance and,
often times, professional services and other products and services. We allocate
revenue to delivered components, normally the license component of the
arrangement, using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the
fair value of the undelivered elements, which is specific to us. Fair values for
the maintenance service for our software licenses are based upon renewal rates
stated in the contracts or, in limited cases, separate sales of renewals to
other customers. Fair value for the professional services and other products and
services is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other
customers. We recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the
contract term. Our professional services, which include consulting,
implementation management, integration management, custom report writing and
training, are generally billed based on hourly rates plus travel and lodging
related expense reimbursements. Our professional services and other revenue also
includes revenue from our semi-annual conferences, which is generated primarily
from attendance fees. We recognize revenue as these professional services are
performed. Other recurring revenues, which are subscription and transaction
based, include interfacing and downloading of securities information from third
party providers. Subscription-based revenues and any related set-up fees are
recognized ratably over the period of the contract. Transaction-based revenues
are generally recognized when the transactions occur. Revenues for license
development agreements are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method
of accounting based on costs incurred to date compared with the estimated cost
of completion. In June 2002, we began to offer term licenses as an alternative
to the perpetual licenses we have historically offered to customers. We
recognize revenue for term licenses ratably over the period of the contract
term. We recognize revenue on perpetual licenses upon shipment assuming all
other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Looking forward, it is too
early to predict any trends or adoption rates with respect to customer
preferences related to term or perpetual licensing and through fiscal 2002 the
majority of our software license revenues were from perpetual licenses.

         We analyze specific accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes
in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts.

         VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL We
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets" in the first fiscal quarter of 2002. SFAS 142
supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17 "Intangible Assets" and
discontinues the amortization of goodwill. SFAS 142 primarily addresses the
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial
recognition. The provisions of SFAS 142 (1) prohibit the amortization of
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, (2) require that goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles assets be tested annually for impairment (and in
interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of
goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired), (3) require
that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future
impairments of goodwill, and (4) remove the forty-year limitation on the
amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives.

         SFAS 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using
a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to
identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with
its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit
exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not
impaired, thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second
step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment
loss, compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the
carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit
goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss
shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of
goodwill shall be determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to
all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized
intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to
acquire the reporting unit. During the second quarter of 2002, we completed this
first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test measured as of January
1, 2002. This first test did not indicate impairment and, therefore, no changes
were made based on the outcome of this testing. The second step of the
transitional impairment test was not required. During the fourth quarter of
2002, as part of our annual impairment test, we completed the first step of the
impairment test measured as of November 1, 2002. This first test did not
indicate impairment and, therefore, the second step of the impairment test was
not necessary.

         We review property, equipment and other long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors we consider
important which


                                       2
<PAGE>

could trigger an impairment review include the following (1) significant
underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating
results; (2) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets
or the strategy for our overall business; (3) significant negative industry or
economic trends; (4) significant decline in our stock price for a sustained
period; and (5) our market capitalization relative to net book value.
Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets' carrying amount to their
expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its expected future discounted cash flow.

         We hold minority interests in several privately held companies having
operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus. Most of these
investments can be considered in the start-up or developing stages and are
classified as "other assets" on our balance sheet. One of these investments is
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our portion of net income
and losses for this investment has not been significant to date. We record an
investment write-down when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in
value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions
or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an
inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be
reflected in an investment's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring
an impairment charge in the future. We estimate an investment's current carrying
value based primarily on market conditions, recent valuation events and
operating results of the underlying investment.


         INCOME TAXES - Income tax expense includes U.S. and international
income taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected
tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements
or tax returns for temporary differences between the tax basis of the assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts. A valuation allowance is then
established to reduce the net deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not
that the related tax benefit will not be realized.. Significant factors
considered by management in its determination of the probability of the
realization include: 1) our historical operating results; 2) expectations of
future earnings; and 3) the length of time over which the differences will be
paid.

OVERVIEW

ACQUISITIONS

         In January 2001, we acquired all outstanding equity of Rex Development
Partners, L.P., a limited partnership, for approximately $8.6 million in cash
and acquisition costs. This business combination was accounted for as a purchase
and the results of operations are included in our consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date. Rex Development Partners, L.P. was
formed to accelerate the development of technology incorporated in our Rex
service. This purchase provides us with core technologies, which will be used in
Advent TrustedNetwork. The allocation of the purchase price for Rex Development
Partners, L.P. was based on the estimated fair value of the net assets of
$100,000 at the acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $1.0 million
and current liabilities of $900,000), and acquired technologies of $8.5 million.
The acquired intangible is included in other assets, net on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

         In April 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of NPO
Solutions, Inc. ("NPO"), a privately held provider of integrated computer
software solutions for nonprofit organizations, located in Loudon, New
Hampshire, through our wholly-owned subsidiary MicroEdge, Inc. The total
purchase price was $8.1 million, with an additional $1.5 million potentially to
be distributed to NPO stockholders if NPO meets certain milestones. The purchase
price consisted of $6.8 million of cash as well as $1.3 million in net
liabilities assumed and acquisition related expenses. This business combination
was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations are included in
our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. The
allocation of the purchase price of NPO was based on the estimated fair value of
the net liabilities of approximately $1.3 million at the acquisition date
(consisting of current assets of $700,000; property, plant and equipment of
$160,000; and current liabilities of $2.2 million), goodwill of $2.8 million,
and other intangibles primarily consisting of customer base and acquired
technologies of $5.3 million. During 2002, we paid an additional $500,000 of
earn-outs since NPO met certain milestones, which was recorded as an increase to
goodwill. The goodwill and other intangibles are included in other assets, net
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount allocated to intangibles was
determined based on management's estimates using established valuation
techniques.

         In November 2001, we acquired certain assets of ManagerLink.com for a
total purchase price of $2.9 million, consisting of $1.5 million in cash as well
as $1.4 in net liabilities assumed and acquisition related expenses. This
transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations are
included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition
date. ManagerLink.com provides consolidated portfolio reporting tools to CPA's,
family offices, and other firms. We acquired ManagerLink.com at amounts
exceeding the tangible and identifiable intangible fair values of assets and
liabilities resulting in goodwill of $1.5 million in order to further increase
our deployment of Advent TrustedNetwork. The allocation of the purchase price
for ManagerLink.com was based on the estimated fair value of the net liabilities
of $1.4 million at the acquisition date (consisting of current assets of
$22,000; property, plant and equipment of $156,000; and current liabilities of
$1.6 million), goodwill of $1.5 million (deductible for tax purposes), and other
intangibles consisting of acquired technology and trade name of $1.4 million
which have a weighted average amortization period of five years. The goodwill
and other intangibles are included in other assets, net on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The amount allocated to intangibles was determined based on
management's estimates using established valuation techniques.

         In November 2001, we acquired all of the common stock of our
Scandinavian distributors' operations located in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.
Including an adjustment to the purchase price in June 2002 and closing costs, we
paid a total of $14.2 million in cash and closing costs and assumed $4.6 million
in net liabilities. In addition, we are required to pay 50% of operating margins
that exceed 20% for the two years after the acquisition. As of December 31,
2002, no additional potential consideration had been earned or paid. These
transactions were accounted for as purchases and the results of operations are
included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition
date. We acquired our Scandinavian distributors' operations at amounts exceeding
the tangible and identifiable intangible fair values of assets and liabilities
in order to expand control over European channels for our products and services.
The adjusted allocation of the purchase price for our Scandinavian distributor
was based on the estimated fair value of the net liabilities of $4.6 million
(consisting of current assets of $2.2 million; property, plant and equipment of
$90,000; deferred tax liabilities of $2.4 million; and current liabilities of
$4.5 million), goodwill of $10.7 million (not deductible for tax purposes), and
other intangibles consisting of licensing agreements and acquired technology of
$8.1 million which

                                       4
<PAGE>

have a weighted average amortization period of approximately five years. The
goodwill and other intangibles are included in other assets, net on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount allocated to intangibles was determined
based on management's estimates using established valuation techniques.

         In February 2002, we acquired Kinexus Corporation, a privately held
company located in New York. Kinexus provides internal account aggregation and
manual data management services which we will use in our Advent TrustedNetwork
service. The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of their
respective fair values on the acquisition date. The results of operations are
included in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition
date. In order to further increase our deployment of Advent TrustedNetwork, we
acquired Kinexus at amounts exceeding the tangible and identifiable intangible
fair values of assets and liabilities.

         The total purchase price of approximately $45.5 million included cash
of approximately $34 million, closing costs of $3 million and a warrant to
purchase 165,176 shares of our Common Stock valued at $8.5 million. The fair
value of the warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes method using the
following assumptions: fair value of common stock of $51.34 per share, interest
rate of 3%, volatility of 65.9% and a dividend rate of zero. The warrant had an
exercise price of $0.01 per share and was exercised in February 2002. There is
$3.8 million of additional contingent consideration that is held in escrow for
14 months, which, if released will be recorded as additional goodwill. There was
a potential earn-out distribution to shareholders of up to $115 million in cash
or stock at the option of Advent under a formula based on revenues and expenses.
No payments will be made under this earn out provision as the performance
criteria were not met.

         During 2002 we adjusted Kinexus goodwill and liabilities assumed,
decreasing both by approximately $4.9 million. The adjustment primarily related
to a reduction of the estimated liability assumed in connection with a vacant
Kinexus facility located in downtown Manhattan within a few blocks of the World
Trade Center site and was based on additional analysis of the local commercial
rental market.

         Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

         Liabilities assumed of $38.9 million include cash advances from Advent
of $4.9 million, change-in-control separation obligations of $11.1 million and
remaining estimated long-term lease obligations of $4 million. The amount
allocated to identifiable intangibles was determined based on management's
estimates using established valuation techniques.

         In July 2002, we acquired Techfi Corporation, a privately held company.
Techfi provides software, technology and services to the financial intermediary
market. This acquisition was consistent with our strategy to add products and
services that meet the needs of a wide variety of sectors in the financial
services industry, as we added the capability that Techfi brings particularly in
the financial planning and independent broker/dealer areas. The acquisition has
been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the
purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities acquired on the basis of their respective fair values on the
acquisition date. The results of operations are included in the consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. The total purchase price
of approximately $22.8 million include cash of $20.2 million, acquisition
related expenses of approximately $800,000 and options to purchase 70,000 shares
of our Common Stock valued at approximately $1.8 million. The options were
valued using the Black-Scholes method to determine fair value, have an exercise
price of $17.39 per share, vest over five years, and expire in August 2012.
There is $2.3 million of additional contingent consideration that is held in
escrow for 14 months, which, if released will be recorded as additional
goodwill. The acquisition price of Techfi exceeded the tangible and identifiable
intangible fair values of assets and liabilities resulting in goodwill of $17.1
million, which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. At the
acquisition date, Techfi's primary purchased in-process research and development
("IPR&D") projects involved the development of a web-enabled system for
portfolio management, performance reporting and contact management;
distributable macro language to automate operational tasks such as downloading,
importing and report printing; and enhancements to their currently offered
AdvisorMart service.

         Purchased IPR&D for Techfi represents the present value of the
estimated after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased
technology, which, at the acquisition date, had not yet reached technological
feasibility. The cash flow projections for revenues were based on estimated
projected revenue and expenses beyond 2003 and expected industry benchmarks.
Revenue estimates also include an estimated annual attrition percentage to
account for the fact that, as time passes, the portion of projected revenue
attributable to purchased IPR&D technologies will become less as newer
technology replaces the capabilities and functionality of the purchased IPR&D
technologies. Estimated operating expenses and income taxes were deducted from
estimated revenue projections to arrive at after-tax cash flows. Projected
operating expenses included costs of goods sold, research and development, sales
and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, including
estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the
market and are


                                        6
<PAGE>

generating revenue. The rates utilized to discount projected cash flows were 20%
to 35% for in-process technologies and were based primarily on rates of return
and the overall level of market acceptance and the amount of time each
respective technology has been in the marketplace.

         As of the date of acquisition, Advent concluded that the purchased
in-process technology had no alternative future use after taking into
consideration the potential use of the technology in different products, the
stage of development and life cycle of each project and resale of the software.
The value of the purchased IPR&D of approximately $1.5 million was expensed at
the time of the acquisition.

         In the quarter ended December 31, 2002, we updated our initial
allocation of the Techfi purchase price for adjustments related to intangibles,
assumed liabilities and deferred tax liabilities resulting in a net increase to
goodwill of approximately $300,000.

intangible assets and liabilities is summarized below (in thousands):

         In September 2002, we acquired all of the common stock of our Greek
distributor, Advent Hellas, for a total purchase price of approximately $6.6
million in cash. In addition, in connection with this acquisition, we are
required to pay 50% of Advent Hellas operating margins that exceed 20% for the
two years after the acquisition, which, if paid, will be recorded as additional
goodwill. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and the results of operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. We acquired our Greek
distributor's operations at amounts exceeding the tangible and identifiable
intangible fair values of assets and liabilities in order to expand our direct
ownership of European channels for our products and services.

         In the quarter ended December 31, 2002, we adjusted our initial
allocation of the purchase price for a re-evaluation of the intangibles and an
adjustment to deferred tax liabilities resulting in an increase to goodwill of
$379,000.

         The updated allocation of the Advent Hellas purchase price was based on
the estimated fair value of the net liabilities of approximately $800,000 at the
acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $800,000; property, plant and
equipment of $30,000; other assets of $10,000; current liabilities of
approximately $1.0 million; and, net deferred tax liabilities of $600,000),
goodwill of $5.8 million which is not deductible for tax purposes, and an
identified intangible for a licensing agreement of $1.6 million which has an
amortization period of six years.

         In November 2002, we purchased all of the outstanding membership
interests of Advent Outsource Data Management, LLC. ("Advent Outsource"),
formerly Uoutsource Data Management, LLC, for approximately $947,000 in cash,
$4.9 million in net liabilities assumed and $184,000 in acquisition costs.
Advent Outsource is an outsource solution provider of portfolio reconciliation
and reporting services via the internet. Advent Outsource stores the clients'
data,


                                        7
<PAGE>

provides secure access over the Web to their accounts, and delivers the Axys
functionality in portfolio management, accounting and reporting. This
acquisition was consistent with our strategy to add products and services that
meet the needs of a wide variety of sectors in the financial services industry
by adding outsourcing capabilities to the solutions we offer our clients,
particularly in the financial planning and independent broker/dealer areas. In
addition to the initial cash consideration, there is also a potential earn-out
distribution to the selling members of up to $5 million through December 31,
2004 under a formula based on revenue results for the years ending December 31,
2003 and 2004, which, if paid, will result in an increase to goodwill. This
business combination was accounted for as a purchase and the results of
operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on
the acquisition date. The preliminary allocation of the Advent Outsource Data
Management, LLC purchase price was based on the estimated fair value of the net
tangible liabilities of $4.9 million (consisting of current assets of
approximately $130,000, net fixed assets of $60,000, other assets of $40,000,
current liabilities of $1.4 million, and long-term liabilities of $3.7 million),
goodwill of $1.7 million which is not deductible for tax purposes, and
identifiable intangibles of $4.1 million comprised of core technologies of
$400,000 with an estimated useful life of two years and licensing agreements of
$3.7 million with an estimated useful life of seven years.

         For our more recent acquisitions, the purchase price allocations may be
further refined over the next few months due primarily to further assessment of
the liabilities assumed.


INVESTMENTS

         In April 2001, Accenture, Microsoft, Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., and
the Bank of New York joined to create Encompys, an independent company that was
formed to develop an internet-based straight-through-processing solution for the
global asset management community. We invested approximately $9 million in this
new business venture, which was carried at the lower of cost or net realizable
value in other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The investment in
Encompys was written off in 2002 after the Board of Directors of Encompys
informed us in May 2002 that it had decided to sell the assets of Encompys and
wind down the operations.

         In 2002, we acquired approximately 15% of the outstanding stock of
LatentZero Limited ("LatentZero"), a privately held company located in England,
for approximately $7 million. Our investment is accounted for under the equity
method of accounting because the Chairman of our Board of Directors is a member
of LatentZero's Board of Directors. Our portion of the net income or losses for
this investment has not been significant to date.

DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIP

         We rely on a number of strategic alliances to help us achieve market
acceptance of our products and to leverage our development, sales, and marketing
resources. In 1998 we established one such relationship with a company in
Scandinavia to distribute our products throughout Scandinavia. In the third
quarter of 1999, this distributor formed Advent Europe. Advent Europe and its
subsidiaries have the exclusive right to distribute our software in the European
Union, excluding certain locations, until July 1, 2004 subject to achieving
certain revenue levels. Incorporated in The Netherlands, Advent Europe is an
independent entity and is not financially backed by us and is entirely
capitalized by independent third party investors. It makes tax and language
modifications to Advent Office to fit the various needs of the local
jurisdictions and then markets and licenses the Advent Office suite and related
services. All transactions between Advent Europe and us are transacted in U.S.
dollars and are arms length transactions. Revenue from sales to this distributor
is recognized when the distributor submits a signed contract, the product has
been delivered, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collection of the
resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Our revenues from this distributor
in each of the three years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, were less
than 4% of our total net revenue.

         Through July 1, 2004, subject to achieving certain revenue levels,
Advent Europe also has the contingent right to require us to purchase any one or
any group of their subsidiaries. Our requirement to purchase is contingent upon
the distributor achieving specified operating margins in excess of 20% and
specified customer satisfaction criteria. The purchase price would be two times
the preceding twelve months total revenue of the purchased subsidiary plus
potential additional consideration equal to 50% of operating margins that exceed
20% that are achieved in the two years subsequent to our acquisition. In
addition, we have the right to purchase any one or any group of Advent Europe's
subsidiaries under certain conditions. In the event these rights are exercised
by us or Advent Europe, the purchase of these subsidiaries would

                                       8
<PAGE>

principally result in an increase in intangible assets, goodwill and
amortization of intangible assets. In November 2001, we acquired three of Advent
Europe's companies located in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark and in September 2002,
we acquired all of the common stock of Advent Hellas, Advent Europe's Greek
subsidiary. During 2003 we may acquire additional operations from Advent Europe.
We anticipate that the purchase price of any such acquisition(s) would not
exceed $10 million.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES

         In September and October 2001 we repurchased and retired 430,000 shares
of our own Common Stock under a program approved by our Board of Directors in
March 2001 to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares from time to time. We paid $14.8
million for an average of $34.44 per share.

         In May and June 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of an additional 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 shares, respectively. During 2002 we
repurchased and retired 2,355,000 shares of our Common Stock for which we paid
$49.7 million at an average price of $21.09 per share.

         In the first quarter of 2003, we repurchased and retired an additional
1,000,000 shares of our Common Stock for an average price of $14.31 per share.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM

         In November 2002, we commenced a voluntary stock option exchange
program made available to certain eligible employees of the Company. The
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief
Technology Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Development are
specifically excluded from participating in the exchange program. Under this
program, eligible employees were given the option to cancel each outstanding
stock option granted to them at an exercise price greater than or equal to $20
per share, in exchange for a new option to buy 0.8 shares of the Company's
Common Stock to be granted on June 5, 2003, six months and one day from December
4, 2002, the expiration date of the offer, and the date the old options of the
participating employees were cancelled. Additionally, options granted in the six
months prior to this exchange offer, irrespective of their exercise prices, were
cancelled for all employees that have elected to participate in this exchange
program. There is no credit given for option vesting during the period between
cancellation of the outstanding option and the grant of the new option. The
exercise price of the new options will be equal to the fair market value of the
Company's Common Stock on the date of grant. In total, 3,336,504 option shares
were eligible to participate in this program and 2,462,102 options were
surrendered for cancellation ranging from $17.39 to $60.375 with a weighted
average exercise price of $47.33 per share. The exchange program is not expected
to result in additional compensation charges or variable option plan accounting.

RESTRUCTURING

         In January 2003 the Company announced that it intends to record a
restructuring charge of approximately $2 million to $3 million in the first
quarter of 2003 primarily related to consolidating excess office space in its
New York facilities. The goal of the restructuring plan is to reduce costs and
improve operating efficiencies by better aligning our resources and
consolidating duplicative efforts in parts of our business as a result of our
integration of the various acquisitions we have made in the past year.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000


REVENUES

         Our net revenues are made up of three components: license and
development fees; maintenance and other recurring; and professional services and
other. License revenues are derived from the licensing of software products
while development fees are derived from development contracts that we have
entered into with other companies, including customers and development partners.
Maintenance and other recurring revenues are derived from maintenance fees
charged in the initial licensing year, renewals of annual maintenance services
in subsequent years and recurring


                                        9
<PAGE>

revenues derived from our subscription-based and transaction-based services.
Professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting,
implementation and integration management, custom report writing, training
services and semi-annual conferences.

         Net revenues were $159.4 million, $170.2 million and $134.9 million in
2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, representing a decrease of 6% from 2001 to
2002 and an increase of 26% from 2000 to 2001. The decrease in net revenues from
2001 to 2002 primarily resulted in a decline in license and development fees
offset in part by an increase in maintenance and other recurring revenues. The
target clients for our products include a range of financial services
organizations that manage investment portfolios, including investment advisors,
brokerage firms, banks and hedge funds. In addition, we target corporations,
public funds, universities and non-profit organizations, which also manage
investment portfolios and have the same needs. The success of many of our
clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets. We
believe that the demand for our products was negatively affected by the current
economic environment, downturns in the financial markets, and by pending and
proposed regulatory activity in the financial services market. These factors
have resulted in reduced revenue growth across the industry, longer sales
cycles, deferral and delay of information technology projects and generally
reduced expenditure for software related services. We expect a continued
difficult environment for the near term. The increase in license revenue from
2000 to 2001, in absolute dollars, was primarily due to increased demand for the
Advent Office suite to both new customers as well as follow-on sales to existing
customers, and for our Geneva software which is licensed primarily to global
financial institutions and hedge funds.

         In each of 2002, 2001, and 2000, the majority of our net revenues were
from domestic sales, with international sales representing less than 8% in each
year. Axys and its related products and services accounted for the majority of
net revenues in 2002, 2001, and 2000. However, we have been successful in
increasing multi-product sales by emphasizing our suite of products and,
therefore, new products have accounted for an increasing portion of net revenues
in all three years.

         Each of the major revenue categories has historically varied as a
percentage of net revenues and we expect this variability to continue in future
periods. This variability is partially due to the timing of the introduction of
new products, the relative size and timing of individual licenses, as well as
the size of the implementation, the resulting proportion of the maintenance and
professional services components of these license transactions and the amount of
client use of pricing and related data.

         LICENSE REVENUE AND DEVELOPMENT FEES. License and development fees
revenue were $53.5 million, $83.6 million, and $66.1 million, for 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively, representing a decrease of 36% from 2001 to 2002 and an
increase of 26% from 2000 to 2001. The decrease in license and development fees
from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to decreased sales of the Advent Office
suite of products during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2002 compared
to the same quarters a year ago. Sales of these products decreased principally
due to the impact of current economic conditions and the slowing economy on the
financial services clients. The increase in license and development fees from
2000 to 2001 was primarily due to increased demand for the Advent Office suite
to both new customers as well as follow-on sales to existing customers, and for
our Geneva software which is sold primarily to global financial institutions and
hedge funds.

         License and development fees revenues as a percentage of net revenues
were 34% in 2002, and 49% in both 2001 and 2000. The 2002 decrease in license
and development fees revenue as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due
to the year-over-year decline in license revenue while maintenance and other
recurring revenues continue to increase. We typically license our products on a
per server, per user basis with the price per site varying based on the
selection of the products licensed and the number of authorized users. We earn
development fees when we provide product solutions which are not part of our
standard product offering. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000
revenue from development fees has been less than 10% of total license and
development fees revenue.

         MAINTENANCE AND OTHER RECURRING REVENUES. Maintenance and other
recurring revenues were $87.3 million, $67.7 million and $50.1 million for 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 29% from 2001 to 2002 and
35% from 2000 to 2001. These increases, in all periods, were primarily due to a
larger customer base and higher average maintenance fees as clients selected
more components for a full feature, multi product solution and expanded the
number

                                       10
<PAGE>

of users and sites licensing our software. Increased revenue from our Advent
Custodial Data services as well as our other data feed revenue sources also
contributed to the year-over-year rise of maintenance and other recurring
revenues in 2002 and 2001. Revenue associated with our acquisition of Kinexus in
February 2002 and increased demand for pricing data and other data services
associated with our Wealth Management Solutions also contributed to increased
maintenance and other recurring revenues in 2002.

         Maintenance and other recurring revenues, as a percentage of net
revenues, were 55%, 40% and 37% in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The 2002
increase in maintenance and other recurring revenues as a percentage of revenue
is primarily due to the combination of a year-over-year decrease in license
revenue and a year-over-year increase in maintenance and other recurring
revenue.

         PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND OTHER REVENUES. Professional services and
other revenues were $18.7 million, $18.9 million and $18.7 million for 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively, representing a decrease of 1% from 2001 to 2002 and
an increase of 1% from 2000 to 2001. The slight decrease in revenue between 2001
and 2002 is due to a decrease in the demand for our other professional services
which were negatively affected by the impact of current economic conditions and
the slowing economy on the financial services clients partially offset by
additional services revenue earned through our newly acquired subsidiary,
Kinexus. The relatively flat revenue between 2002, 2001 and 2000 reflects our
continued encouragement of independent qualified third party implementers to
provide professional services to our clients.

         Professional services and other revenues, as a percentage of net
revenues did not fluctuate significantly and was 12% in 2002, 11% in 2001 and
14% in 2000.

COST OF REVENUES

         Our cost of revenues is made up of three components: cost of license
and development fees; cost of maintenance and other recurring; and cost of
professional services and other. Our cost of revenues was $36.6 million, $29.6
million, and $24.9 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing
increases of 24% from 2001 to 2002 and 19% from 2000 to 2001.

         COST OF LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT FEES. Cost of license and development
fees revenue consists primarily of royalties and other fees paid to third
parties, cost of product media including duplication, manuals and packaging
materials, the fixed direct labor involved in producing and distributing our
software and labor costs associated with generating development fees. Cost of
license and development fees revenues were $7.0 million, $6.5 million and $5.3
million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, representing increases of 7.7% from 2001 to
2002 and 22% from 2000 to 2001. The increases in cost of license and development
fees are directly related to the product mix in license and development fees
revenue. Cost of license and development fees as a percentage of the related
revenues was 13% in 2002 and 8% in both 2001 and 2000. The increase as a
percentage of revenue in 2002 is primarily due to the decrease in revenues
compared to the fixed costs associated with our product distribution, to a
lesser extent, product mix.

         COST OF MAINTENANCE AND OTHER RECURRING. Cost of maintenance and other
recurring revenues is primarily comprised of the direct costs of providing
technical support and other services for recurring revenues, the engineering
costs associated with product updates and royalties paid to third party
subscription-based and transaction-based vendors. Cost of maintenance and other
recurring revenues was $22.8 million, $17.0 million, and $13.5 million for 2002,
2001 and 2000, representing increases of 34% from 2001 to 2002 and 26% from 2000
to 2001. The increase from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to the acquisition of
Kinexus. The increase from 2000 to 2001 was due to additional staffing required
to support additional subscription based services as well as an increasing
customer base, continued interface development and increased royalties paid to
third party subscription-based and transaction-based vendors.

         Cost of maintenance and other recurring revenues as a percentage of the
related revenues did not fluctuate significantly and was 26%, 25% and 27% for
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

         COST OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND OTHER. Cost of professional services
revenue primarily consists of personnel related costs associated with the client
services and support organization in providing consulting, custom report writing
and conversions of data from clients' previous systems. To the extent that such
personnel are not fully utilized in

                                       11
<PAGE>

consulting, training, conversion or custom report writing projects, they are
used by presales, marketing and engineering activities and the related costs are
charged to operating expenses. Also included are direct costs associated with
our semi-annual user conferences and travel expenses. Cost of professional
services and other revenues were $6.8 million, $6.2 million and $6.1 million,
representing increases of 10% from 2001 to 2002 and 1% from 2000 to 2001. These
increases are primarily related to changes in our product mix. Cost of
professional services as a percentage of related revenues did not fluctuate
significantly and was 36%, 33% and 33% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

OPERATING EXPENSES

         SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
the costs of personnel involved in the sales and marketing process, sales
commissions, advertising and promotional materials, sales facilities expense,
trade shows, and seminars. Our sales and marketing expenses were $65.6 million,
$52.2 million and $42.6 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, representing increases
of 26% from 2001 to 2002 and 23% from 2000 to 2001. The increases in expense in
2002 was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing personnel primarily
related to our acquisitions of Kinexus, Techfi, Advent Outsource and Advent
Hellas, and increased marketing programs targeting our core markets and our
Wealth Management initiatives such as Advent TrustedNetwork and WealthLine. In
2000, sales and marketing expenses also increased due to moving our New York
City sales office to a larger facility in April 2000. Sales and marketing
expenses, as a percentage of net revenues were 41%, 31% and 32% in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. The significant increase in sales and marketing expense
as a percentage of net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to
the decrease in revenues over the same periods and an increase in sales and
marketing expenses in 2002 compared to 2001.

         PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. Product development expenses consist primarily of
salary and benefits for our development staff as well as contractors fees and
other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and services
and development of new products and services. Costs associated with product
updates are included in cost of maintenance and other recurring revenue. Product
development expenses were $ 39.6 million, $27.4 million and $21.6 million for
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, representing increases of 45% from 2001 to
2002 and 27% from 2000 to 2001. Product development expenses increased primarily
due to a growth in personnel as we increased our product development efforts to
accelerate the rate of product enhancements and new product introductions, both
released and unreleased, in connection with Geneva, Advent Office and our Wealth
Management initiatives such as WealthLine and Advent TrustedNetwork. We also
incurred additional personnel costs in 2002 related to our acquisitions of
Kinexus and Techfi.

         Product development expenses, as a percentage of net revenues, were 25%
in 2002 and 16% in both 2001 and 2000. The increase as a percentage of revenue
in 2002 was primarily due to increased development expenses combined with a
decrease in revenues during 2002.

         GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of personnel costs for finance, administration, operations and general
management, as well as legal and accounting expenses. General and administrative
expenses were $20.9 million, $14.8 million and $12.0 million for 2002, 2001 and
2000, representing an increase of 41% from 2001 to 2002 and 24% from 2000 to
2001. The increases in both periods was primarily due to increased number of
personnel and related costs required to support the growth and increasing
complexities of our business, an increase in personnel related to the
acquisitions of Kinexus and Techfi and an increase in legal fees due to certain
litigation matters. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net
revenues, were 13% in 2002 and 9% in both 2001 and 2000. The increase as a
percentage of revenue in 2002 was primarily due to increased expenses combined
with a decrease in revenues during 2002.

         AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES. We record goodwill and other intangibles
based on the application of established valuation techniques using our estimates
of market potential, product introductions, technology trends, and other
relevant cash flow assumptions. We periodically assess our estimates related to
the valuation model to determine if the assets acquired have been impaired. If
we determine that there has been impairment, there could be additional charges
to income. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" issued in July 2001, we
did not record any amortization of goodwill on our acquisitions of
ManagerLink.com, our Scandinavian distributors, Kinexus, Techfi, Advent Hellas
or Advent Outsource and ceased

                                       12
<PAGE>

amortization of all other goodwill beginning on January 1, 2002. We recorded
amortization of other intangibles of $10.9 million in 2002 and recorded
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles of approximately $4.7 million in
2001 and $1.5 million in 2000. These increases are attributed to the
acquisitions of Kinexus, the three Scandinavian distributors, Rex Development
Partners L.P., Techfi, NPO Solutions, ManagerLink.com, Advent Outsource and
Advent Hellas.

         PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Purchased in-process
research and development ("IPR&D") of $1.5 million was incurred in the third
quarter of 2002 in conjunction with our acquisition of Techfi. This amount
represents the present value of the estimated after-tax cash flows expected to
be generated by the purchased technology, which, at the acquisition date, had
not yet reached technological feasibility. The cash flow projections for
revenues were based on estimated projected revenue and expenses beyond 2003 and
expected industry benchmarks. Revenue estimates also include an estimated annual
attrition percentage to account for the fact that, as time passes, the portion
of projected revenue attributable to purchased IPR&D technologies will become
less as newer technology replaces the capabilities and functionality of the
purchased IPR&D technologies. Estimated operating expenses and income taxes were
deducted from estimated revenue projections to arrive at after-tax cash flows.
Projected operating expenses included costs of goods sold, research and
development, sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses,
including estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been
introduced into the market and are generating revenue. The rates utilized to
discount projected cash flows were 20% to 35% for in-process technologies and
were based primarily on rates of return and the overall level of market
acceptance and the amount of time each respective technology has been in the
marketplace.

INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, NET

         Interest income and other, net consists primarily of interest income,
realized gains and losses on short-term investments and miscellaneous
non-operating income and expense items. Interest income and other expense, net
was approximately $5.9 million, $8.3 million and $7.3 million in 2002, 2001, and
2000, respectively. The slight decrease in interest income and other, net from
2000 to 2001 was substantially due to lower interest rates during 2002. The
increase in interest income and other, net from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to
higher interest income from higher than average investment balances in 2001
resulting from our August 2001 secondary offering.

LOSS ON INVESTMENTS

         Loss on investments included other-than-temporary losses on our
investments in privately held companies. Loss on investments was approximately
$13.5 million, $2 million and $497,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
loss on investments for 2002 is primarily the result the write-off of our
investments in Encompys, Inc. and myCFO, Inc. We wrote off approximately $9
million related to our investment in Encompys based on information provided to
us by the Board of Directors of Encompys. In May 2002, the Board of Directors of
Encompys, Inc. informed us that it had decided to sell the assets of Encompys
and wind down the operations. We wrote off $2 million related to our investment
in myCFO, Inc. based on a September 27, 2002 announcement by the Harris Wealth
Management Group that it reached an agreement to acquire certain assets of
myCFO, Inc. resulting in no anticipated recovery of our initial investment.
Remaining write offs related to our various other investments of approximately
$2.5 million, $2 million and $497,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
increased year-over-year primarily due to the general downturn in the economy.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

         We had an effective income tax rate of 17% in 2002 and 34% in both 2001
and 2000. In 2002 the rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35%
primarily due to changes in valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets
resulting from the write-downs of certain investments, the effect of the
purchased in-process research and development and state income taxes partially
offset by certain research and development credits.

         In 2001 and 2002 this rate differed from the federal statutory rate of
35% primarily due to state income tax, offset by certain research and
development credits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

         Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities at
December 31, 2002 were $173.8 million,

                                       13
<PAGE>

decreasing by $114.8 million from $288.6 million at December 31, 2001. The
decrease was primarily due to $95.1 million in payments made in connection with
the acquisitions of Kinexus, Techfi, Advent Hellas and Advent Outsource and
$49.7 million for the repurchase of stock, partially offset by $30 million in
cash generated from operations.

         The net cash of $30 million provided by operating activities for 2002
was primarily due to net income excluding non-cash items, such as depreciation,
amortization, the tax benefit from exercise of stock options, the one time
write-off of in-process research and development fees associated with our Techfi
acquisition and the other-than-temporary losses from investments, and a $22.1
million decrease in accounts receivable, resulting primarily from a decrease in
2002 revenues compared to 2001 and increased collections. Increases in net cash
provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $8.2 million
increase in net income taxes receivable due primarily to a difference in the
2002 and 2001 effective income tax rates, a $5.4 million decrease in accrued
liabilities and a $1.7 million decrease in deferred revenue due to lower sales
in 2002. The net cash used in investing activities during 2002 of $83.7 million
is primarily due to $95.1 million, including approximately $6 million cash in
escrow, paid in connection with the acquisitions of Kinexus, Techfi, Advent
Hellas, Advent Outsource and earn-outs related to the acquisition of NPO
Solutions, a net $8.1 million spent in connection with minority investments in
other businesses and $6.7 million paid for fixed assets, partially offset by
$26.2 million net proceeds received from short-term marketable security
investment activities. The net cash used in financing activities during 2002 of
$34.3 million was primarily due to the $49.7 million used to repurchase and
retire our own Common Stock offset in part by $15.5 million in cash generated
from stock issued under the employee stock benefit plans.

         The net cash of $43.0 million provided by operating activities for 2001
was primarily due to net income, increases in deferred revenues, the tax benefit
associated with common stock issued under employee benefit plans, and
depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges. These increases to net
cash were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable as well as
prepaid and other assets. The net cash of $119.7 million used in investing
activities for 2001 primarily related to net expenditures of $44.1 million to
acquire or make investments in complementary businesses and technologies, net
short-term investment purchases of $66.5 million, and expenditures of $9.1
million for furniture, fixtures and equipment and leasehold improvements
primarily for our additional new leased office space at our corporate
headquarters in San Francisco, California. The net cash of $146.6 million
provided by financing activities for 2001 was primarily due to $138 million in
net proceeds from our August 2001 common stock offering, $15.4 million in
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock benefit
plans and $5 million from the exercise of a warrant, partially offset by $14.8
million used to repurchase and retire our common stock under a stock repurchase
program that had been announced earlier in the year.

         The net cash of $35.3 million provided from operating activities for
2000 was primarily due to net income and an increase in deferred revenues, the
tax benefit associated with common stock issued under employee benefit plans,
and depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges. These were
partially offset by increases in accounts receivable as well as prepaid and
other assets. The net cash used in investing activities of $15.1 million for
2000 primarily related to expenditures of $10.4 million for furniture, fixtures
and equipment and leasehold improvements primarily for our additional new leased
office space at our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California as well
as new, larger leased space for our offices in New York, New York. The net cash
of $12.6 million provided by financing in 2000 was primarily due to proceeds
from the issuance of stock under our employee stock benefit plans.

         At December 31, 2002, we had $161.3 million in working capital, down
from $311.3 million at December 31, 2001. We currently have no significant
capital commitments other than commitments under our operating leases. During
2002, our operating lease commitments increased to $64 million through 2012,
cumulatively, primarily due to additional leases assumed in connection with our
Kinexus and Techfi acquisitions and a new operating lease for additional
facilities in San Francisco signed in the second quarter of 2002, partially
offset by a successful exit from a lease commitment for unoccupied space in San
Francisco.

         During 2003 we may acquire additional operations from Advent Europe. We
anticipate that the purchase price of any such acquisition(s) would not exceed
$10 million.

         At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we did not have any relationships with
unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often
referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have
been

                                       14
<PAGE>

established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements
or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not
materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could
arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

         Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flows, which is
dependent upon continued market acceptance of our products and services. We
believe that our available sources of funds and anticipated cash flows from
operations will be adequate to finance current operations and anticipated
capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.


NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
SFAS No.146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities".
SFAS No. 146 nullifies the guidance of the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")
in EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred
in a Restructuring)". Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, an entity recognized a
liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an
exit plan. In SFAS No. 146, the FASB acknowledges that an entity's commitment to
a plan does not, by itself, create a present obligation to the other parties
that meets the definition of a liability and requires that a liability for a
cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred. It also establishes that fair value is the objective for
the initial measurement of the liability. SFAS 146 will be effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expect
a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations for the
adoption of SFAS 146.

         In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN
45"), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires that a
liability be recorded in the guarantor's balance sheet upon issuance of a
guarantee. In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosure about the guarantees that an
entity has issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the entity's product
warranty liabilities. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions
of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for
financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. Our software license agreements typically indemnify our clients for
intellectual property infringement claims. We also warrant to our clients that
our software operates substantially in accordance with our specifications. We
believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements. However, we continue to evaluate the
impact of FIN 45 on our financial statements and related disclosures.

         In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Costs-Transition and Disclosure". This statement amends
SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", and provides
alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. It also
requires additional disclosures about the effects on reported net income of an
entity's accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation. We
account for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and have adopted the disclosure-only
alternative of SFAS No. 123. We adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No.
148 in December 2002.

         In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN No. 46"),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN No. 46 expands upon and
strengthens existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should
include in its financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of
another entity. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust,
or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not
have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not
provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities.
FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company
if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable
interest entity's activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the
entity's residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003.
The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year
or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Disclosure requirements apply
to any financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. We have considered
the provisions of FIN No. 46 and believe it will not be necessary to include any
of our private equity

                                       15
<PAGE>

investments in our consolidated financial statements. We will however continue
to evaluate the impact of FIN No. 46 on our financial statements and related
disclosures.

                   RISK FACTORS AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


         The discussion in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this Annual Report
contains trend analysis and other forward-looking statements that are based on
current expectations and assumptions made by management. Words such as
"expects", "anticipates", "intends", "plans", "believes", "seeks", "estimates",
and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify
such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to
predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from those expressed
or forecasted in the forward-looking statements as a result of the factors
summarized below and other risks detailed from time to time in public
announcements, registration statements and filings with the SEC, including
reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Additionally, the financial statements for the
periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for
any future period.

         We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of
risks, some of which are beyond our control. These risks include the potential
for period to period fluctuations in operating results and the dependence on
continued market acceptance of our current product offerings and the successful
development and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements on a
timely, cost effective basis. Additionally, we derive a majority of our revenue
from the licensing of Axys and our Advent Office suite. We cannot be certain
that Axys or Advent Office will continue to be well received by our customers.
Also, we are dependent on the stability of financial markets, the health of the
economy generally, the maintenance of our relationship with Interactive Data
Corporation, and our ability to remain competitive against new and existing
rivals in our market. In particular, our net revenues and operating results have
varied substantially from period to period on a quarterly basis and may continue
to fluctuate due to a number of factors. Software product backlog at the
beginning of any quarter typically represents only a small portion of that
quarter's expected revenues. In addition, as licenses into multi-user networked
environments increase both in individual size and number, the timing and size of
individual license transactions are becoming increasingly important factors in
our quarterly operating results. The sales cycles for these transactions are
often lengthy and unpredictable, and the ability to close large license
transactions on a timely basis or at all could cause additional variability in
our quarterly operating results. In June 2002, we announced that we would begin
to offer term licenses as an alternative to the perpetual licenses we have
previously sold. Although we believe that this will give us more predictable
revenue in the long term, it may potentially decrease our revenues in the short
term as some clients make the shift from perpetual to term and therefore we
recognize less revenue at the beginning of the contract. We also expect that our
gross and operating margins may fluctuate from period to period as we continue
to introduce new recurring revenue products, change our professional services
organization and associated revenue, continue to hire and acquire additional
personnel and increase other expenses to support our business. Because these
expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, a fluctuation in revenue could
lead to operating results differing from expectations. Our stock price may also
be subject to wide fluctuations, particularly during times of high market
volatility, and if our net revenues or earnings fail to meet the investment
community's expectations, our stock price is likely to decline.

         A number of factors including market volatility, global economic
uncertainty and reductions in capital expenditures by large customers could
adversely impact our results. The target clients for our products include a
range of organizations that manage investment portfolios, including investment
advisors, brokerage firms, banks and hedge funds. In addition, we target
corporations, public funds, universities and non-profit organizations, which
also manage investment portfolios and have many of the same needs. The success
of many of our clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial
markets. We believe that demand for our products could be disproportionately
affected by fluctuations, disruptions, instability or downturns in the financial
markets which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or
delay, cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management
systems and software products. If the current economic slowdown continues, the
presence of factors in the market for large management software systems such as
reductions in capital expenditures by large customers, poor performance in
financial markets, and increasing competition will likely materially adversely
affect our business and results of operations.


                                       17
<PAGE>

         We may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products
or technologies. In addition, we continually evaluate the performance of all our
products and product lines and may sell or discontinue current products or
product lines. The number of acquisitions completed in 2001 and 2002 is
unprecedented for us. The complex process of integrating our acquisitions has
required and will continue to require significant resources, particularly in
light of our relative inexperience integrating acquisitions. Integrating our
acquisitions has been and will continue to be time consuming, expensive and
disruptive to our business. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of our
acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of these entities could
harm our business, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we may
have to incur debt, write-off software development costs or other assets, incur
severance liabilities, amortize expenses related to goodwill and other
intangible assets or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions.
The issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing stockholders'
ownership.

         Our business has grown in recent years through both internal expansion
and acquisitions, and that growth along with any continued growth may cause a
significant strain on our infrastructure, internal systems and managerial
resources. To manage our growth effectively, we must continue to improve and
expand our infrastructure, including operating and administrative systems and
controls, and continue managing headcount, capital and processes in an efficient
manner.

         We have made investments in privately held companies, which we classify
as "other assets" on our balance sheet. The value of these investments is
influenced by many factors, including the operating effectiveness of these
companies, the overall health of these companies' industries, the strength of
the private equity markets and general market conditions. Due to these and other
factors, we have previously determined, and may in the future determine, that
the value of these investments is impaired, which has caused and would cause us
to write down the stated value of these investments.

         Our operations are exposed to interruption by fire, earthquake, power
loss, telecommunications failure, and other events beyond our control.
Additionally, we are vulnerable to interruption caused by political and
terrorist incidents. Such interruptions could affect our ability to sell and
deliver products and services and other critical functions of our business and
could seriously harm us. Further, such attacks could cause instability in the
financial markets upon which we depend.

         The market for investment management software is intensely competitive
and highly fragmented, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new
product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants. Our
competitors include providers of software and related services as well as
providers of timeshare services. Our competitors vary in size, scope of services
offered and platforms supported. In addition, we compete indirectly with
existing and potential clients, many of whom develop their own software for
their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software
products offered by independent vendors like us. Many of our competitors have
longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, sales and marketing
resources than we do. In addition, we also face competition from potential new
entrants into our market that may develop innovative technologies or business
models. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against
current and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in
price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of
which could seriously harm our business.

         Our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop
new products or product enhancements that address the future needs of our target
markets and to respond to changing industry standards and practices. We may not
be successful in developing, introducing and marketing new products or product
enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis, or at all, and our new
products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of
the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. Delays in the commencement of
commercial shipments of new products or enhancements may result in client
dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues. If we are unable, for
technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products or
enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing
market conditions or client requirements, or if new products or new versions of
existing products do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be
seriously harmed.

         To take advantage of the internet, we are developing services to bring
internet-based products and services to clients. We cannot assure you that there
will not be disruptions in internet services which could harm our business. The
internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many
sources. Computer viruses could be

                                       18
<PAGE>

introduced into our systems or those of our customers or other third parties,
which could disrupt or make it inaccessible to customers. We may be required to
expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of
security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. To the extent
that our activities may involve the storage and transmission of proprietary
information, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation
and possible liability. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent
security breaches, and our business would be harmed if we do not prevent them.
In addition, we cannot assure you that there will not be disruptions in internet
services beyond our control or that of our third party vendors. Any such
disruptions could harm our business.

         As we develop new products and services, we have entered, and will
continue to enter, into development agreements and other agreements with
information providers, clients or other companies in order to accelerate the
delivery of new products and services, such as our relationship with Microsoft
for WealthLine. We may not be successful in marketing our internet services or
in developing other internet services or maintaining these relationships.
Additionally, we may not be successful in being able to replace our current
technology with new technology. Our failure to do so could seriously harm our
business.

         Our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when
first introduced or as new versions are released. Despite testing by us and by
current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products until
after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or a delay in
market acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

         Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology, it may be possible
for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. We do
not have any patents, and existing copyright laws afford only limited
protection. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not develop
substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or that
equivalent products will not be marketed in competition with our products,
thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. We cannot
assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are
patentable, that any patent, if issued, would provide us with any competitive
advantages or would not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of
others will not adversely affect our ability to do business. Litigation may be
necessary to protect our proprietary technology. This litigation may be
time-consuming and expensive. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to
obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.

         We have expanded in recent periods into a number of new business areas
to foster long-term growth including international operations, strategic
alliances and AdventTrusted Network. These areas are still relatively new to our
product development and sales personnel. New business areas require significant
management time and resources prior to generating significant revenues and may
divert management from our core business. There is no assurance that we will
compete effectively or will generate significant revenues in these areas. In
order to further expand our international operations, we will need to continue
to establish additional facilities, acquire other businesses or enter into
additional distribution relationships in other parts of the world. The expansion
of our existing international operations and entry into additional international
markets will require significant management attention and financial resources.
We cannot be certain that our establishment of facilities in other countries
will produce desired levels of revenue. We currently have limited experience in
developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our
products internationally. In addition, international operations are subject to
other inherent risks.

         We believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of
our senior management and key technical personnel, none of whom has an
employment agreement with us. Additionally, our continued success depends, in
part, on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified
technical, sales and other personnel. Because our future success is dependent on
our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are
particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain
qualified engineers with the requisite education, backgrounds and industry
experience. We may also be required to create additional performance and
retention incentives in order to retain our employees, including the granting of
additional stock options to employees at current prices or issuing incentive
cash bonuses.

*  THE DECREASE IN 2002 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN OVERALL DECLINE IN REVENUES, ADDITIONAL INTANGIBLES AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND THE
   WRITE-DOWN OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS. IN 1998, ADVENT RECOGNIZED CHARGES OF $8.4 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE WRITE-OFF OF
   PURCHASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER EXPENSES.

                              ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC.
            NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (UNAUDITED)

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     OPERATIONS We provide stand-alone and client/server software products, data
interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate, integrate and
support certain mission-critical functions of the front, middle and back offices
of investment management organizations. Our clients vary significantly in size
and assets under management and include investment advisors, brokerage firms,
banks, hedge funds, corporations, public funds, foundations, universities and
non-profit organizations.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Advent and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions and amounts have been eliminated.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The functional currency of our foreign
subsidiaries is their local currencies. All assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average rate
of exchange during the period.

     USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on
information available as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The amounts reported for cash
equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and accounts payable are
considered to approximate their market values based on comparable market
information available at the respective balance sheet dates and their short-term
nature.

     CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less. These
securities are maintained with major financial institutions.

     MARKETABLE SECURITIES All of our marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value,
with the unrealized gains and losses, net of any related tax effect, reported in
accumulated components of comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Realized gains and losses
and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale
securities are included in interest and other, net, in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

     INVESTMENTS Investments are included in other assets and consist of
non-marketable investments in privately held companies, most of which can be
considered in the start-up or development stages. One of these investments is
accounted for under the equity method of accounting because the Chairman of our
Board of Directors is a member of the investee's Board of Directors. Our portion
of net income or loss for this investment has not been significant to date and
is included in loss on investments on our statement of operations. The remaining
investments are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Our
investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of
the investee's operations indicate that the decline in value of the investment
is other than temporary. Such indicators include, but are not limited to,
limited capital resources, limited prospects of receiving additional financing,
and prospects for liquidity of the related securities. Impaired investments in
privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value, which is the
amount we believe is recoverable from our investment.

     PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT Product development expenses consist primarily of
salary, benefits, and contractors fees for our development and technical support
staff, and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and
services and development of new products and services. Costs incurred for
software development prior to


                                       26
<PAGE>

technological feasibility are expensed as product development costs in the
period incurred. Once the point of technological feasibility is reached,
development costs are capitalized until the product is available for general
release. Capitalized costs are then amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life or on the ratio of current revenue to the total projected
product revenue, whichever is greater. To date, the period between achieving
technology feasibility, which we define as the establishment of a working model
and which typically occurs when beta testing commences, and the general
availability of such software has been short. As such, software development
costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant and therefore no
costs have been capitalized to date.

     CAPITALIZATION OF INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE Costs incurred for web site design,
creation and maintenance of content, graphics and user interface are expensed as
incurred. Costs for development of internal use software are capitalized and
amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to five years.
Costs of approximately $414,000, $836,000 and $877,000 related to development of
internal use software were capitalized in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. We calculate depreciation and
amortization using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful
lives. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is computed using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets
or the remaining lease term. The cost and related accumulated depreciation
applicable to property and equipment sold or no longer in service are eliminated
from the accounts and any gains or losses are included in operations. Useful
lives by principal classifications are as follows:

                  Office equipment           5 years
                  Computers and software     3 - 6 years
                  Leasehold improvements     3 - 11 years

     Repairs and maintenance expenditures, which are not considered improvements
and do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed as
incurred.

     ACCOUNTING FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are stated at cost less
accumulated amortization and include goodwill, completed technology and
non-compete and distribution agreements. Goodwill is the excess of cost over
fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill from acquisitions subsequent to
June 30, 2001 has not been amortized. Goodwill acquired prior to July 1, 2001,
was amortized through December 31, 2001 on a straight-line basis over the
estimated periods of benefit. As of December 31, 2002, the estimated lives of
goodwill acquired prior to July 1, 2001 and all acquired intangibles is as
follows:

                  Goodwill acquired prior to July 1, 2001       4 to 7 years
                  Completed technology                          3 to 7 years
                  Agreements                                    5 to 7 years
                  Customer base and tradename                   3 to 7 years

     We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" in the first fiscal quarter of 2002. SFAS
No. 142 supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17 "Intangible
Assets" and discontinues the amortization of goodwill. SFAS No. 142 primarily
addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their
initial recognition. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 (1) prohibit the
amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, (2) require
that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles assets be tested annually for
impairment (and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the
carrying value of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be
impaired), (3) require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of
assessing potential future impairments of goodwill, and (4) remove the
forty-year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have
finite lives.

     SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using
a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to
identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with
its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit
exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not
impaired, thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second
step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment
loss, compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill


                                       27
<PAGE>

with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting
unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair
value of goodwill shall be determined by allocating the fair value of a
reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of this first step of the
transitional goodwill impairment test measured as of January 1, 2002. This first
test did not indicate impairment and, therefore, no changes were made based on
the outcome of this testing. The second step of the transitional impairment test
was not required. During the fourth quarter of 2002, as part of our annual
impairment test, we completed the first step of the impairment test measured as
of November 1, 2002. This first test did not indicate impairment and, therefore,
the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary.

     ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS We review property, equipment and other
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Factors we
consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the
following (1) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results; (2) significant changes in the manner of our
use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; (3)
significant negative industry or economic trends; (4) significant decline in our
stock price for a sustained period; and (5) our market capitalization relative
to net book value. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets'
carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
expected future discounted cash flow.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS We license
application software products and offer annual maintenance programs which
provide for technical support and updates to our software products. We offer
professional services that primarily include consulting, implementation
management, integration management, custom report writing and training. We offer
other recurring revenue products and services that are subscription-based and
transaction-based that primarily include interfacing and downloading of
securities information from third party providers. Development agreements
provide for the development of technologies and products that are expected to
become part of our product or product offerings in the future.

     We recognize revenue from software licenses when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists which is evidenced by a signed agreement, the product has
been delivered F.O.B shipping point, the fee is fixed and determinable and
collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Sales through our
distributor are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship
together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor's
customers. Our arrangements do not generally include acceptance provisions yet
if acceptance provisions are provided delivery occurs upon acceptance. Our
arrangements for sale of software licenses are sold with maintenance and, often
times, professional services and other products and services. We allocate
revenue to delivered components, normally the license component of the
arrangement, using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the
fair value of the undelivered elements, which is specific to us. Fair values for
the maintenance service for our software licenses are generally based upon
renewal rates stated in the contracts. Fair value for the professional services
and other products and services is based upon separate sales by us of these
services to other customers. We recognize revenue for maintenance services
ratably over the contract term. Our professional services are generally billed
based on hourly rates, and we recognize revenue as these services are performed.
Subscription-based revenues and any related set-up fees are recognized ratably
over the period of the contract. Transaction-based revenues are generally
recognized when the transactions occur. Revenues for development agreements are
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting based on
costs incurred to date compared with the estimated cost of completion. In June
2002, we began to offer term licenses as an alternative to the perpetual
licenses we have historically offered to customers.

     We analyze specific accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes
in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. We also analyze customer demand and acceptance of our product
and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales
returns, which are not generally provided to our customers. Allowances for sales
returns are accounted for as deductions of net revenues and increases to
deferred revenues.

     ADVERTISING COSTS We expense advertising costs as incurred. Total
advertising expenses were approximately $85,000, $73,000, and $77,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

                                       28

     STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We use the intrinsic value-based method to account
for all of our stock-based employee compensation plans and have adopted the
disclosure-only alternative of SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation", as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation". We are required to disclose the pro forma effects on operating
results as if we had elected to use the fair value approach to account for all
our stock-based employee compensation plans. Stock-based compensation for
non-employees is based on the fair value of the related stock or options.

     The fair value of warrants, options or stock exchanged for services is
expensed over the period benefited. The warrants and options are valued using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

     If compensation had been determined based on the fair value at the grant
date for awards in 2002, 2001 and 2000, consistent with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123, our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share for the year
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, would have been as follows
(in thousands, except per share data):

                                            2002            2001           2000
- -------------------------------- ---------------- --------------- --------------
Net income (loss) - as reported        $(19,236)         $31,465        $25,774
Net income (loss) - pro forma          $(33,351)         $18,788        $18,956
PER SHARE DATA
DILUTED
Net income (loss) - as reported        $  (0.57)         $  0.89        $  0.75
Net income (loss) - pro forma          $  (0.99)         $  0.53        $  0.55
BASIC
Net income (loss) - as reported        $  (0.57)         $  0.98        $  0.86
Net income (loss) - pro forma          $  (0.99)         $  0.58        $  0.63

     Such pro forma disclosures may not be representative of future compensation
costs because options vest over several years and additional grants are made
each year.

     The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted were $39.85,
$26.32 and $31.13 per option for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and
2000, respectively.

     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted average
assumptions:

                                        2002            2001           2000
- -------------------------------- ---------------- --------------- --------------
Risk-free interest rate                 3.8%            4.5%           6.3%
Volatility                             71.8%           65.9%          63.7%
Expected life                         5 years         5 years        5 years
Expected Dividends                      None            None           None
Average turnover rate                    8%              8%             8%

     The fair value for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan rights were also
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes options pricing model with
the following assumptions for 2002, 2001 and 2000: risk-free interest rates of
1.6%, 3.7%, and 6.3% respectively; dividend yield of 0%; volatility factors of
71.8%, 65.9% and 63.7% for 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively; and a six-month
expected life. The weighted average fair value of the ESPP rights granted in
2002, 2001 and 2000, were $15.73, $19.56 and $15.24, respectively.

     INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the
expected tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial
statements or tax returns for temporary differences between the tax basis of the
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. A valuation allowance is then
established to reduce the net deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not
that


                                       29
<PAGE>

the related tax benefit will not be realized.

     NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic net income (loss) per share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for that period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed
giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding
during the period. Dilutive potential shares consist of incremental common
shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants and conversion of
preferred stock (none outstanding) for all periods.

     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net
income (loss), net unrealized foreign currency translation adjustment and net
unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale marketable securities and is
presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and
consolidated statement of operations.

     SEGMENT INFORMATION We have determined that we have a single reportable
segment consisting of the development, marketing and sale of stand-alone and
client/server software products, data interfaces and related maintenance and
services that automate, integrate and support certain mission critical functions
of investment management organizations. Management uses one measurement of
profitability and does not disaggregate its business for internal reporting. No
country or region outside North America accounted for more than 10% of our total
revenue for years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000. No one customer
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for years ended December 31,
2002, 2001, and 2000.

     CERTAIN RISKS AND CONCENTRATIONS Our product revenues are concentrated in
the computer software industry, which is highly competitive and rapidly
changing. Significant technological changes in the industry or customer
requirements, or the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities or
technologies could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, we derive a
majority of our revenues from licensing our application Axys and its related
suite of applications, and therefore its market acceptance is essential to our
success.

     Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of
credit risks comprise, principally, cash, short-term marketable securities, and
trade accounts receivable. We invest excess cash through banks, mutual funds,
and brokerage houses primarily in highly liquid securities and have investment
policies and procedures that are reviewed periodically to minimize credit risk.
Our short-term marketable securities consist of diversified investment grade
securities. We believe no significant concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to these securities.

     With respect to accounts receivable, we perform ongoing credit evaluations
of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves
for potential credit losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary. At
December 31 2002, 2001 and 2000 no customer accounted for more than 10% of
accounts receivable or 10% of revenues for the years then ended.

     RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect
on results of operations or stockholders' equity.

     RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No.146, "Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities". SFAS No. 146 nullifies the guidance of the
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") in EITF Issue No. 94-3, "Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)". Under EITF
Issue No. 94-3, an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date
that the entity committed itself to an exit plan. In SFAS No.146, the FASB
acknowledges that an entity's commitment to a plan does not, by itself, create a
present obligation to the other parties that meets the definition of a liability
and requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. It also
establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the
liability. SFAS No.146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that
are initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expect a significant impact on
our financial position and results of operations for the adoption of SFAS
No.146.

     In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"),
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires that a liability

                                       30
<PAGE>

be recorded in the guarantor's balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee. In
addition, FIN 45 requires disclosure about the guarantees that an entity has
issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the entity's product warranty
liabilities. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN
45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for
financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. Our software license agreements typically indemnify our clients for
intellectual property infringement claims. We also warrant to our clients that
our software operates substantially in accordance with our specifications. We
believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements. However, we continue to evaluate the
impact of FIN 45 on our financial statements and related disclosures.

     In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Costs-Transition and Disclosure". This statement amends SFAS No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", and provides alternative methods
of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based compensation. It also requires additional
disclosures about the effects on reported net income of an entity's accounting
policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation. We account for
stock-based compensation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees" and have adopted the disclosure-only alternative of
SFAS No. 123. We adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 in December
2002.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN No. 46 expands upon and
strengthens existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should
include in its financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of
another entity. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust,
or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not
have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not
provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities.
FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if
that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable
interest entity's activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the
entity's residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003.
The consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year
or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Disclosure requirements apply
to any financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. We have considered
the provisions of FIN 46 and believe that it will not be necessary to include
any of our private equity investments in our consolidated financial statements.
We will however continue to evaluate the impact of FIN No. 46 on our financial
statements and related disclosures.

3. ACQUISITIONS

     In January 2001, we acquired all outstanding equity of Rex Development
Partners, L.P., a limited partnership, for approximately $8.6 million in cash
and acquisition costs. This business combination was accounted for as a purchase
and the results of operations are included in our consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date. Rex Development Partners, L.P. was
formed to accelerate the development of technology incorporated in our Rex
service. This purchase provides us with core technologies which will be used in
Advent TrustedNetwork. The allocation of the purchase price for Rex Development
Partners, L.P. was based on the estimated fair value of the net assets of
$100,000 at the acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $1.0 million
and current liabilities of $900,000), and acquired technologies of $8.5 million.

     In April 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of NPO
Solutions, Inc. ("NPO"), a privately held provider of integrated computer
software solutions for nonprofit organizations, located in Loudon, New
Hampshire, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, MicroEdge, Inc. The total
purchase price was $8.1 million, with an additional $1.5 million potentially to
be distributed to NPO stockholders if NPO meets certain milestones. The purchase
price consisted of $6.8 million of cash as well as $1.3 million in net
liabilities assumed and acquisition related expenses. This business combination
was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations are included in
our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.

     The allocation of the purchase price of NPO was based on the estimated fair
value of the net liabilities of approximately $1.3 million at the acquisition
date (consisting of current assets of $700,000; property, plant and equipment of
$160,000; and current liabilities of $2.2 million), goodwill of $2.8 million,
and other intangibles primarily consisting of customer base and acquired
technologies of $5.3 million. During 2002, we paid an additional $500,000 of


                                       32
<PAGE>

earn-outs since NPO met certain milestones, which was recorded as an increase to
goodwill. The amount allocated to intangibles was determined based on
management's estimates using established valuation techniques.

     In November 2001, we acquired certain assets of ManagerLink.com for a total
purchase price of $2.9 million, consisting of $1.5 million in cash as well as
$1.4 million in net liabilities assumed and acquisition related expenses. This
transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations are
included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition
date. ManagerLink.com provides consolidated portfolio reporting tools to CPAs,
family offices, and other firms. We acquired ManagerLink.com at amounts
exceeding the tangible and identifiable intangible fair values of assets and
liabilities resulting in goodwill of $1.5 million in order to further increase
our deployment of Advent TrustedNetwork. The allocation of the purchase price
for ManagerLink.com was based on the estimated fair value of the net liabilities
of $1.4 million at the acquisition date (consisting of current assets of
$22,000; property, plant and equipment of $156,000; and current liabilities of
$1.6 million), goodwill of $1.5 million (deductible for tax purposes), and other
intangibles consisting of acquired technology and trade name of $1.4 million
which have a weighted average amortization period of 5 years. The amount
allocated to intangibles was determined based on management's estimates using
established valuation techniques.

     In November 2001, we acquired all of the common stock of our Scandinavian
distributors' operations located in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Including an
adjustment to the purchase price in June 2002 and closing costs, we paid a total
of $14.2 million in cash and closing costs plus $4.6 million in net liabilities
assumed. In addition, we are required to pay 50% of operating margins that
exceed 20% for the two years after the acquisition. As of December 31, 2002, no
additional potential consideration has been earned or paid. These transactions
were accounted for as purchases and the results of operations are included in
our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. We
acquired our Scandinavian distributors' operations at amounts exceeding the
tangible and identifiable intangible fair values of assets and liabilities in
order to expand control over European channels for our products and services.
The adjusted allocation of the purchase price for our Scandinavian distributor
was based on the estimated fair value of the net liabilities of $4.6 million at
the acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $2.2 million; property,
plant and equipment of $90,000; deferred tax liabilities of $2.4 million; and
current liabilities of $4.5 million), goodwill of $10.7 million (not deductible
for tax purposes), and other intangibles consisting of licensing agreements and
acquired technology of $8.1 million which have a weighted average amortization
period of approximately five years. The amount allocated to intangibles was
determined based on management's estimates using established valuation
techniques.

     In February 2002, we acquired Kinexus Corporation, a privately held company
located in New York. Kinexus provides internal account aggregation and manual
data management services which we will use in our Advent TrustedNetwork service.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of their respective fair
values on the acquisition date. The results of operations are included in the
consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. In order to
further increase our deployment of Advent TrustedNetwork, we acquired Kinexus at
amounts exceeding the tangible and identifiable intangible fair values of assets
and liabilities.

     The total purchase price of approximately $45.5 million included cash of
approximately $34 million, closing costs of $3 million and a warrant to purchase
165,176 shares of our Common Stock valued at $8.5 million. The fair value of the
warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes method using the following
assumptions: fair value of common stock of $51.34 per share, interest rate of
3%, volatility of 65.9% and a dividend rate of zero. The warrant had an exercise
price of $0.01 per share and was exercised in February 2002. There is $3.8
million of additional contingent consideration that is held in escrow for 14
months, which if released will be recorded as additional goodwill. There was
also a potential earn-out distribution to shareholders of up to $115 million in
cash or stock at the option of Advent under a formula based on revenues and
expenses. No payments will be made under this earn-out provision as the
performance criteria were not met.

     During 2002 we adjusted Kinexus goodwill and liabilities assumed,
decreasing both by approximately $4.8 million. The adjustment primarily related
to a reduction of the estimated liability assumed in connection with a vacant
Kinexus facility located in downtown Manhattan within a few blocks of the World
Trade Center site and was based on additional analysis on the local commercial
rental market.

     The adjusted allocation of the Kinexus purchase price to tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities is summarized

     Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

     Liabilities assumed of $38.9 million include cash advances from Advent of
$4.9 million, change-in-control separation obligations of $11.1 million and
remaining estimated long-term lease obligations of $4 million. The amount
allocated to identifiable intangibles was determined based on management's
estimates using established valuation techniques.

     In July 2002, we acquired Techfi Corporation, a privately held company.
Techfi provides software, technology and services to the financial intermediary
market. This acquisition was consistent with our strategy to add products and
services that meet the needs of a wide variety of sectors in the financial
services industry, as we added the capability that Techfi brings particularly in
the financial planning and independent broker/dealer areas. The acquisition has
been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the
purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities acquired on the basis of their respective fair values on the
acquisition date. The results of operations are included in the consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. The total purchase price
of approximately $22.8 million includes cash of $20.2 million, acquisition
related expenses of $800,000 and options to purchase 70,000 shares of our Common
Stock valued at approximately $1.8 million. The options were valued using the
Black-Scholes method to determine fair value, have an exercise price of $17.39
per share, vest over five years, and expire in August 2012. There is $2.3
million of additional contingent consideration that is held in escrow for 14
months, which, if released, will be recorded as additional goodwill. The
acquisition price of Techfi exceeded the tangible and identifiable intangible
fair values of assets and liabilities resulting in goodwill of $17 million,
which is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. At the acquisition
date, Techfi's primary purchased in-process research and development ("IPR&D")
projects involved the development of a web-enabled system for portfolio
management, performance reporting and contact management; distributable macro
language to automate operational tasks such as downloading, importing and report
printing; and enhancements to their currently offered AdvisorMart service.

     Purchased IPR&D for Techfi represents the present value of the estimated
after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology,
which, at the acquisition date, had not yet reached technological feasibility.
The cash flow projections for revenues were based on estimated projected revenue
and expenses beyond 2003 and expected industry benchmarks. Revenue estimates
also include an estimated annual attrition percentage to account for the fact
that, as time passes, the portion of projected revenue attributable to purchased
IPR&D technologies will become less as newer technology replaces the
capabilities and functionality of the purchased IPR&D technologies. Estimated
operating expenses and income taxes were deducted from estimated revenue
projections to arrive at after-tax cash flows. Projected operating expenses
included costs of goods sold, research and development, sales and marketing
expenses and general and administrative expenses, including estimated costs to
maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market and are
generating revenue. The rates utilized to discount projected cash flows were 20%
to 35% for in-process technologies and were based primarily on rates of return
and the overall level of market acceptance and the amount of time each
respective

technology has been in the marketplace.

     As of the date of acquisition, Advent concluded that the purchased
in-process technology had no alternative future use after taking into
consideration the potential use of the technology in different products, the
stage of development and life cycle of each project and resale of the software.
The value of the purchased IPR&D of approximately $1.5 million was expensed at
the time of the acquisition.

     In the quarter ended December 31, 2002, we updated our initial allocation
of the Techfi purchase price for adjustments related to intangibles, assumed
liabilities and deferred tax liabilities resulting in a net increase to goodwill
of approximately $300,000.

     The updated allocation of the Techfi purchase price to tangible and
intangible assets and liabilities is summarized below (in thousands, except for
estimated remaining useful life):

     In September 2002, we acquired all of the common stock of our Greek
distributor, Advent Hellas, for a total purchase price of approximately $6.6
million in cash. In addition, in connection with this acquisition, we are
required to pay 50% of Advent Hellas operating margins that exceed 20% for the
two years after the acquisition, which, if paid, will be recorded as additional
goodwill. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and the results of operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. We acquired our Greek
distributor's operations at amounts exceeding the tangible and identifiable
intangible fair values of assets and liabilities in order to expand our direct
ownership of the European channels for our products and services.

     In the quarter ended December 31, 2002, we adjusted our initial allocation
of the purchase price for a re-evaluation of the estimated useful life of
certain intangibles and an adjustment to deferred tax liabilities resulting in
an increase to goodwill of $379,000.

     The updated allocation of the Advent Hellas purchase price was based on the
estimated fair value of the net liabilities of approximately $800,000 at the
acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $800,000; property, plant and
equipment of $30,000; other assets of $10,000; current liabilities of
approximately $1 million and net deferred tax liabilities of $600,000), goodwill
of $5.8 million which is not deductible for tax purposes, and an identified
intangible for a licensing agreement of $1.6 million which has an amortization
period of 6 years.

     In November 2002, we purchased all of the outstanding membership interests
of Advent Outsource Data Management, LLC. ("Advent Outsource"), formerly
Uoutsource Data Management, LLC, for approximately $947,000 in cash, $4.9
million in net liabilities assumed and $184,000 in acquisition costs. Advent
Outsource is an outsource solution provider of portfolio reconciliation and
reporting services via the internet. Advent Outsource stores the clients' data,
provides secure access over


                                       35
<PAGE>

the Web to their accounts, and delivers the Axys functionality in portfolio
management, accounting and reporting. This acquisition was consistent with our
strategy to add products and services that meet the needs of a wide variety of
sectors in the financial services industry by adding outsourcing capabilities to
the solutions we offer our clients, particularly in the financial planning and
independent broker/dealer areas. In addition to the initial cash consideration,
there is also a potential earn-out distribution to the selling members of up to
$5 million through December 31, 2004 under a formula based on revenue results
for the years ending December 31, 2003 and 2004, which, if paid, will result in
an increase to goodwill. This business combination was accounted for as a
purchase and the results of operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. The preliminary
allocation of the Advent Outsource Data Management, LLC purchase price was based
on the estimated fair value of the net tangible liabilities of $4.9 million
(consisting of current assets of approximately $130,000, net fixed assets of
$60,000, other assets of $40,000, current liabilities of $1.4 million and
long-term liabilities of $3.7 million), goodwill of $1.7 million which is not
deductible for tax purposes, and an identifiable intangibles of $4.1 million
comprised of core technologies of $400,000 with an estimated useful life of 2
years and licensing agreements of $3.7 million with an estimated useful life of
seven years.

         For our more recent acquisitions, the purchase price allocations may be
further refined over the next few months due primarily to further assessment of
the liabilities assumed.

Outsource had been completed at the beginning of the periods being reported on
and after giving effect to purchase accounting adjustments. The pro forma

     Long-term equity investments include investments in several privately held
companies, most of which can still be considered in the start-up or development
stages and are classified as "other assets" on our balance sheet. In 2002, we
acquired approximately 15% of the outstanding stock of LatentZero Limited
("LatentZero"), a privately-held company located in England, for approximately
$7 million. Our investment is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting because the Chairman of our Board of Directors is a member of the
LatentZero Board of Directors. Our portion of net income or loss for this
investment has not been significant to date. These investments are inherently
risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development
are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. The value of these
investments is influenced by many factors, including the operating effectiveness
of these companies, the overall health of the companies' industries, the
strength of the private equity markets and general market conditions. We could
lose our entire initial investment in these companies.

     Loss on investments includes a non-cash charge of approximately $13.8
million during the year ended December 31, 2002 related to the write-down of our
long-term investments, primarily our investments in Encompys, Inc. and myCFO,
Inc. We wrote off approximately $9 million related to our investment in Encompys
based on information provided to up by the Board of Directors of Encompys. In
May 2002, the Board of Directors of Encompys, Inc. informed us that it had
decided to sell the assets of Encompys and wind down the operations. Encompys
was formed in April 2001 by Accenture, Microsoft, Compaq and the Bank of New
York to provide an internet-based straight-through-processing solution for the
global asset management community. We wrote off $2 million related to our
investment in myCFO, Inc. based on a September 27, 2002

     Additions to goodwill include $29.4 million, $16.8 million, $5.4 million
and $1.7 million related to the acquisitions of Kinexus in February 2002, Techfi
in July 2002, Advent Hellas in September 2002, and Advent Outsource in November
2002, respectively. The net adjustments of $1.5 million and $1.6 million to
goodwill and intangible assets, respectively, are primarily related to increases
to goodwill for a net $700,000 of additional cash consideration paid for
Scandinavian purchase price adjustments, a re-allocation of $2.4 million and
$600,000 of the Scandinavian and Greek subsidiaries' purchase price,
respectively, to deferred tax liabilities, a re-allocation of the Scandinavian
purchase price to increase operating accruals approximately $300,000, an
increase of $250,000 resulting from a decrease in the valuation of the Techfi
intangible assets and $500,000 of additional consideration paid to the former
NPO stockholders in connection with performance based earn-outs. Decreases to
goodwill included $4 million related to the revision to the estimate of an
assumed liability for a lease of a vacant Kinexus facility located in downtown
Manhattan within a few blocks of the World Trade Center site, approximately
$800,000 related to the reduction of Kinexus operating accruals, a $200,000
increase in the valuation of Advent Hellas intangible assets and a $200,000
re-allocation of the purchase price to increase Techfi deferred tax assets.
Additional increases to goodwill and intangibles are attributed to translation
adjustments as the U.S. Dollar weakened against European currencies during 2002.

     No provision has been made for the United States federal or state or
additional foreign income taxes related to approximately $1.9 million of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended
to be permanently reinvested. It is not practical to determine the United States
federal income tax liability, if any, which would be payable if such earnings
were not permanently reinvested.

     Deferred tax assets of $55.3 million and $3.1 million are included in other

       A valuation allowance is established at December 31, 2002 for the
deferred tax asset related to the capital loss carry forward and unrealized
capital losses of approximately $6 million. The remaining valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2002 is primarily attributable to
pre-acquisition net operating loss carry forwards from acquired companies.

     At December 31, 2002, we had federal and state net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $62 million that are attributable to acquired
companies. Utilization of these loss carry forwards is subject to certain
limitations under the federal income tax laws. In addition, we had approximately
$20 million of federal and state net operating loss carry forwards not subject
to these limitations.

     The carry forward period for the U.S. Federal and State net operating loss
carry forwards ends between 2020 and 2022. The capital loss carry forwards
expire in 2007.

     We lease office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating lease
agreements, which expire at various dates through May 2012. Some operating
leases contain escalation provisions for adjustments in the consumer price
index. We are responsible for maintenance, insurance, and property taxes. Future
minimum payments under the non-cancelable operating leases consist of the
following at December 31, 2002 (in thousands):

     Rent expense for 2002, 2001, and 2000, was approximately $7.7 million, $6.4
million, and $4.9 million, respectively, net of sub-rental income of $159,000,
$133,000, and $28,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For the majority of
our primary lease contracts we have five-year extension options.

     A European distributor, Advent Europe, and its subsidiaries that operate in
certain European locations have the exclusive right to sell our software in the
European Union, excluding certain locations, until July 1, 2004 subject to
achieving certain revenue levels. During this period the distributor also has
the contingent right to require us to purchase any one or any group of their
subsidiaries. Our requirement to purchase is contingent upon the distributor
achieving specified operating margins greater than 20% and specified customer
satisfaction criteria. The purchase price would be two times the preceding
twelve months total revenue of the purchased subsidiaries plus potential
additional consideration equal to 50% of operating margins greater than 20% that
are achieved in the two years subsequent to our acquisition. In addition, we
have the right to purchase any one or any group of the distributor's
subsidiaries under certain conditions. In the event that these rights are
exercised by Advent or the distributor, the purchase of these subsidiaries would
principally result in an increase in intangible assets, goodwill and
amortization of intangible assets. During 2003 we may acquire additional
operations from Advent Europe. We anticipate that the purchase price of any such
acquisition(s) would not exceed $10 million.

     From time to time we are subject to various other legal proceedings, claims
and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not expect that
the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect
on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     401(K) PLAN

     We have a 401(k) deferred savings plan covering substantially all
employees. Employee contributions, limited to 15% of compensation up to $10,500,
are matched 50% by us, up to 6% of employee compensation for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Matching contributions by the Company in 2002,
2001, and 2000, were approximately $1,562,000, $1,341,000, and $1,045,000,
respectively. In addition to the employer matching contribution, we may make
profit sharing contributions at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The
profit sharing contribution for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were zero, $472,000 and
$374,000, respectively.

     1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

     All individuals employed by Advent are eligible to participate in the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("Purchase Plan") if Advent employs them for at
least 20 hours per week and at least five months per year. The Purchase Plan
permits eligible employees to purchase our Common Stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the

                                       42
<PAGE>

lower of the closing sale price for our Common Stock reported on the NASDAQ
National Market at the beginning or the end of each six-month offering period.
In any calendar year, eligible employees can withhold up to 10% of their salary
and certain variable compensation. A total of 900,000 shares of Common Stock
have been reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan of which approximately
796,000 shares have been issued as of December 31, 2002. Approximately 164,000,
69,000, and 74,000 shares were issued through the Purchase Plan at weighted
average prices of $20.11, $42.09, and $29.59 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

SECONDARY OFFERING

     In August 2001, we completed a secondary public offering of 2,750,000
shares of common stock at $57.11 per share, excluding offering costs. Of the
2,750,000 shares offered, 200,000 were sold by a selling stockholder. The net
proceeds of the offering to us were approximately $138 million.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE

     In 2001, Advent's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to one
million shares of outstanding common stock. A total of 430,000 shares were
repurchased in 2001. The Company paid $14.8 million for an average of $34.44 per
share. In May and June 2002, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
an additional 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 shares, respectively. During 2002 we
repurchased and retired a total of 2,355,000 shares for which we paid $49.7
million at an average price of $21.09 per share. The purchases may be made, from
time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and
will be funded from available working capital. The repurchase program will allow
us to help manage the dilution of our shares from our employee stock programs.

WARRANT

     In March 2001 we issued a fully vested non-forfeitable stock purchase
warrant to purchase a total of 191,644 shares of our Common Stock to a customer
from whom we had revenue of $3.4 million, $7.1 million and $1.2 million in 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. The warrant was issued for cash consideration of $5
million, which was the estimated


                                       43
<PAGE>

Black-Scholes fair value. The warrant has an exercise price of $45.375 per
share, is immediately exercisable, and expires in March 2006.

     In February 2002, we acquired Kinexus Corporation, a privately held company
located in New York. The total purchase price of approximately $45.5 million
included cash of approximately $34 million, closing costs of $3 million and a
warrant to purchase 165,176 shares of our Common Stock valued at $8.5 million.
The fair value of the warrant was calculated using the Black-Scholes method
using the following assumptions: fair value of common stock of $51.34 per share,
interest rate of 3%, volatility of 65.9% and a dividend rate of zero. The
warrant had an exercise price of $0.01 per share and was exercised in February
2002.

STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE

     In November 2002, the Company commenced a voluntary stock option exchange
program made available to certain eligible employees of the Company. The
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief
Technology Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Development are
specifically excluded from participating in the exchange program. Under this
program, eligible employees were given the option to cancel each outstanding
stock option granted to them at an exercise price greater than or equal to $20
per share, in exchange for a new option to buy 0.8 shares of the Company's
Common Stock to be granted on June 5, 2003, six months and one day from December
4, 2002, the expiration date of the offer, and the date the old options of
participating employees were cancelled. Additionally, options granted in the six
months prior to this exchange offer, irrespective of their exercise prices, were
cancelled for all employees that have elected to participate in this exchange
program. There is no credit given for option vesting during the period between
cancellation of the outstanding option and the grant of the new option. The
exercise price of the new options will be equal to the fair market value of the
Company's Common Stock on the date of grant. In total, 3,336,504 option shares
were eligible to participate in this program and 2,462,102 options were
surrendered for cancellation ranging from $17.39 to $60.375 with a weighted
average exercise price of $47.33 per share. The exchange program is not expected
to result in additional compensation charges or variable option plan accounting.

STOCK OPTIONS

     In February and May 2002, the Board of Directors and the stockholders,
respectively, approved the 2002 Stock Plan. Under our 2002 Stock Plan ("Plan")
we may grant options to purchase Common Stock to employees and consultants.
Options granted may be incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options
and shall be granted at a price not less than fair market value on the date of
grant. Fair market value (as defined in the Plan) and the vesting of these
options shall be determined by the Board of Directors. The options generally
vest over 5 years and expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant.
Unvested options on termination of employment are canceled and returned to the
Plan. The 2002 Stock Plan has an "evergreen" provision which adds an annual
increase to the plan on the last day of the Company's fiscal year beginning in
2002 equal to the lesser of (i) 1,000,000 shares, (ii) 2% of the Company's
outstanding shares on such date, or (iii) a lesser number of shares determined
by the Board of Directors. All remaining options from the expired 1992 Stock
Plan have rolled over to the 2002 Stock Plan. The terms of the 1992 Stock Plan
were substantively the same as the terms of the new 2002 Stock Plan.

     In July 2002, we acquired Techfi Corporation, a privately held company. The
total purchase price of approximately $22.8 million includes cash of $20.2
million, acquisition related expenses of $800,000 and options to purchase 70,000
shares of our Common Stock valued at approximately $1.8 million. The options
were issued under the 1992 Stock Plan and were valued using the Black-Scholes
method to determine fair value, have an exercise price of $17.39 per share, vest
over five years, and expire in August 2012.

     The activity under the 2002 and 1992 Stock Plans (collectively referred to
as the "Plans" was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

     Options generally vest over five years, are exercisable only upon vesting,

2,726,000 and 2,607,000 options outstanding which were exercisable without right
of repurchase with an aggregate exercise price of $36,100,000, $45,278,000 and
$30,100,000, respectively.

     In 2001, we have granted to certain employees of a distributor 25,000 stock
options that have an exercise price of $40, vest over 5 years and have a term of
10 years. The options are subject to variable plan accounting, which requires us
to re-measure compensation cost for outstanding options each reporting period
based on changes in the market value of the underlying common stock until the
time the options are exercised, are forfeited or expire unexercised. During the
years ended December 31, 2002 we recorded stock-based credits of $2,000 related
to these options and for the year ended 2001 and 2000, we recorded stock
compensation of $148,000 and $136,000, respectively.

     In November 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 Non-statutory
Stock Option Plan ("Non-statutory Plan") and reserved 300,000 shares of Common
Stock for issuance thereunder. Under our 1998 Non-statutory Plan, we may grant
options to purchase Common Stock to employees and consultants, excluding persons
who are executive officers and directors. Options granted are non-statutory
stock options and shall be granted at a price not less than fair market value on
the date of grant. Fair market value (as defined in the Non-statutory Plan) and
the vesting of these options shall be determined by the Board of Directors. The
options generally vest over 5 years and expire no later than 10 years from the
date of grant. Unvested options on termination of employment are canceled and
returned to the Non-statutory Plan.

to purchase 30,000 shares on the latter of the date of effectiveness of the
Director Plan or the date upon which such person first becomes a director. The
exercise price of each option is equal to the fair market value of our Common
Stock as of the date of the grant. In subsequent years, each Outside Director is
automatically granted an option to purchase 6,000 shares on December 1 with an
exercise price equal to the fair value of our Common Stock on that date. Initial
options granted under the Director Plan vest one-fifth of the shares on the
first anniversary date of grant and the remaining shares vest ratably each month
over the ensuing four years. Subsequent option grants begin to vest on the
fourth anniversary of the date of grant and vest ratably each month over the
next 12-month period. All Director Plan options have a ten-year term.

     The activity under the Director Plan was as follows (in thousands, except

10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     In January 2003, we announced our intent to record a restructuring charge
of approximately $2 million to $3 million in the first quarter of 2003 primarily
related to consolidating excess office space in our New York facilities. The
goal of the restructuring plan is to reduce costs and improve operating
efficiencies by better aligning our resources and consolidating duplicative
efforts in parts of our business as a result of our integration of the various
acquisitions we have made in the past year.

     In the first quarter of 2003, we repurchased and retired an additional
1,000,000 shares of our Common Stock for an average price of $14.31 per share.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Advent Software, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advent
Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets."

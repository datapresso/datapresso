PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

    Advent  Software,  Inc.  (Advent) is a leading  provider of stand-alone  and
client/server  software  products,  data  interfaces  and related  services that
automate  and  integrate  certain   mission-critical   functions  of  investment
management organizations. Advent Office(TM), an Enterprise Investment Management
(EIM)  solution,  is an  integrated  suite of products  designed to automate the
entire investment  management process. The Advent Office suite contains Axys(R),
a portfolio  accounting  and  management  system,  Moxy(R),  a trading and order
management system, Qube(R), a client relationship management system, Rex(TM), an
automated  reconciliation  system,  Advent  Warehouse(TM),  an  investment  data
warehouse solution,  Advent Partner(TM),  an investment  partnership  accounting
system,  Advent  Browser  Reporting(TM),  an  Internet-based  solution to access
Advent  Office  information,  and Open G/L, a  component  that  allows  users to
integrate  portfolio  management data with their general ledger systems.  Advent
also  provides  Geneva(R),  a  real-time  accounting  and  portfolio  management
solution for global financial institutions,  and Gifts for Windows(TM), a grants
management solution for the grant-giving  community.  These products address the
need to facilitate the management of increasingly large and complex  information
and data flows both within investment management  organizations and between such
organizations and third parties, such as brokerage firms,  clients,  custodians,
banks,  pricing services and other data providers.  Our products are designed to
reduce client costs,  improve the accuracy of client information,  and generally
enable  clients to devote more time to  improving  the service  they  provide to
their customers rather than focusing on operational  details. Our strategy is to
develop long-term client  relationships and to maintain a high level of lifetime
client  satisfaction  which we  believe  will  result  in  additional  recurring
revenues from new product licenses,  renewals of existing maintenance  contracts
and the introduction and adoption of new data products.

    Our  clients  include  many of the  world's  leading  investment  management
organizations.  These  organizations  vary  significantly in size,  assets under
management and the complexity of their investment  environments.  At present, we
have licensed our products to over 5,400 institutions in 36 countries for use by
more than 30,000 concurrent users.

    We were  incorporated in 1983 in California and  reincorporated in the State
of Delaware in November 1995.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

    The investment  management  business includes a range of organizations  that
manage investment  portfolios,  including investment advisors,  brokerage firms,
banks and hedge funds.  In addition,  corporations,  public funds,  foundations,
universities  and  non-profit  organizations  manage  investment  portfolios and
perform  similar  portfolio  management  functions.   Recently,  the  investment
management  industry has  experienced  significant  growth which, in combination
with other  factors,  has led to  increasing  demand for software  products that
automate,   simplify  and  integrate  functions  within  investment   management
organizations.  This increasing  demand is driven by several industry  dynamics.
Financial assets under management have increased  substantially  during the last
decade.  As the value of total financial  assets under management has increased,
there has been a  substantial  increase in the number of  investment  management
organizations and a steady introduction of increasingly  sophisticated financial
instruments.  As a  result,  investment  managers  are faced  with  increasingly
complicated  portfolio  accounting  and  management   requirements.   Investment
management   organizations  are  subject  to  extensive  and  evolving  industry
standards and government  regulations.  These dynamics have increased the volume
and  complexity  of  information  and data flows  within  investment  management
organizations  and  between  such  organizations  and  third  parties,  such  as
brokerage firms,  clients,  custodians,  banks,  pricing services and other data
providers.  Consequently,   investment  management  organizations  require  more
sophisticated and integrated  software products for their front, middle and back
offices.   (Front  office  includes  the  marketing  and  customer  relationship
management  aspect of dealing with  customers;  middle  office  focuses on trade
order  management  and  trading  workflow;  and the  back  office  includes  the
accounting  functions  of the  organization.)  In order to  operate  efficiently
within this environment,  investment management  organizations must automate and
integrate their  mission-critical and labor-intensive  functions,  including (i)
investment  decision  support  and client  relationship  management,  (ii) order
management and trading and (iii) portfolio accounting,  performance measurement,
report   generation  and   compliance.   Investment   management   organizations
historically have relied on internally  developed systems,  timesharing services
or simple spreadsheet-based systems to manage information flows. Due to inherent
limitations   in  each  of  these  types  of  systems,   investment   management
organizations   are  demanding   highly   functional,


                                       2
<PAGE>

easy-to-use,  scalable,  cost-effective and flexible software  applications that
automate and integrate their mission-critical business functions.

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

    We offer an  integrated  suite  of  software  products  for  automating  and
integrating work and data flows across the investment  management  organization,
as well as the information flows between the investment management  organization
and external parties.  Our products are intended to reduce client costs, improve
the accuracy of client  information and generally  enable clients to improve the
service  they provide to their  customers  rather than  focusing on  operational
details.  Each software  component in the Advent Office suite focuses on certain
mission-critical  functions  of the  investment  management  organization.  Each
Advent  Office  implementation  is  tailored  to meet the needs of a  particular
market segment, as determined by size, assets under management and complexity of
the  investment  environment.  In  addition,  we  believe  that  our  Enterprise
Investment  Management  solution  is well suited for the  investment  management
functions of corporations, public funds, partnerships, foundations, universities
and non-profit organizations.

    An Enterprise  Investment  Management  solution is an  evolutionary  process
which encompasses three phases:
o          Investment Process  Integration - involves the integration of front-,
           mid-,  and  back-office  components  with each  other as well as with
           standard  productivity  applications  such as  Microsoft  Word(R) and
           Excel(R).  This  integration  eliminates  ineffective   communication
           between processes, minimizes processing errors, and enables growth by
           reducing bottlenecks within the company.
o          Data Collection and  Reconciliation  - enables the investment firm to
           integrate the external data regarding pricing and settlements so that
           the firm can quickly and efficiently settle  transactions and monitor
           performance in an automated fashion.
o          Customer  Responsiveness  -  incorporates  the  capability  for  more
           effective  communication  with  customers  related to their needs and
           holdings with the firm. This capability also enables  decision makers
           for the firm to have timely  access to  information  in order to make
           more effective decisions on behalf of the clients.

BACK OFFICE

    We offer three portfolio  accounting and management  systems:  Axys,  Advent
Partner and Geneva, each targeted at a different market segment, to automate the
back office functions.

    Axys, our core product, introduced in 1993, is a highly functional portfolio
accounting  and  management  system  targeted  towards   investment   management
organizations of all sizes. Axys provides  investment  professionals  with broad
portfolio  accounting  functionality,  timely  decision  support,  sophisticated
performance  measurement  and  flexible  reporting.  Specifically,  clients  can
record, account for and report on a variety of investment instruments, including
equities,  fixed income, mutual funds and cash. Axys users gain access on demand
to portfolio  holdings,  asset  allocation,  realized and  unrealized  gains and
losses,   actual  and  projected  income  and  other  valuable  data.  Portfolio
performance can be measured for individual portfolios or related groups, and for
any specified  time period.  Investment  professionals  can choose from over 200
pre-defined reports with flexible "as-of" reporting,  which can be customized as
to formats and fonts.  Clients can easily generate fully customized reports with
the   assistance   of  the  Axys  Report   Writer.   Clients  can  also  produce
presentation-quality  graphics via an  integrated  link with  Microsoft  Excel's
charting  capability.   In  addition,   Axys  offers  integrated   multicurrency
capabilities  which,  among other things,  allows  reports to be restated in any
currency,   tracks  reclaimable   foreign  withholding  tax,  and  can  identify
components  of  return  attributable  to  market  prices  versus  currency  rate
fluctuations.

    Axys also provides  integration with a variety of investment tools and data.
These  include (i) trade order  management  via Moxy,  (ii)  pricing,  corporate
actions,  analytics and fundamental  data via interfaces to data vendors,  (iii)
automatic  data  entry and  reconciliation  of  trades  with  interfaces  to the
Depository Trust Corporation (DTC),  brokerage firms and custodians (iv) through
the  Internet via our  custodial  data  service and  software,  and (v) Internet
reporting  via the Advent  Browser  Reporting  service,  our Internet  reporting
service.

    Advent  Partner,  introduced in December 1996, is an investment  partnership
allocation  solution which  integrates  with Axys.  This product is specifically
designed for hedge funds, venture funds and limited investment  partnerships who
face  the  complex  and  time-consuming  task  of  consistently  and  accurately
accounting for and reporting on partnership tax allocation and other activities.
The  Windows-based  system  tracks  partner-specific  information,  handles  


                                       3

<PAGE>


the  complexities of allocating  realized and unrealized gains for tax purposes,
allocates performance incentive fees, provides on-demand partner and partnership
reporting on an economic or tax allocation  basis and streamlines the production
of partnership tax returns (K-1's).

    Geneva,  introduced to target  organizations  in 1995 and made  commercially
available in October 1997, is a high-end portfolio management system designed to
meet  the  needs of  large,  global  investment  management  organizations  with
complex,  international  accounting  requirements.  Geneva  offers  feature-rich
global   accounting,   extensive   reporting  and  sophisticated   multicurrency
capabilities.  In addition,  Geneva's highly flexible design allows users to add
newly created financial  instruments and tailor  accounting  treatments to their
specific needs.

    REX,  introduced  in  February  1997,  is the  Advent  Office  solution  for
reconciliation management. REX is integrated with Axys and is designed for firms
that want to  electronically  reconcile  their Axys  information  against  their
custodial   information.   REX  automates  matching  and  helps  users  identify
exceptions,  correct or add  transactions to their portfolios or communicate and
track changes required by their custodian.

    Advent Warehouse,  introduced in 1998, is a complete data warehouse solution
that  allows   investment   professionals  to  readily  access  investment  data
regardless  of how the data was created or  maintained,  without  impacting  the
performance  of their  high  volume  transaction-based  Advent  Office  systems.
Relational technology and data warehousing tools provide an open environment for
ad hoc decision  support and customized  reporting on enterprise wide investment
information.   Investment  professionals  can  take  advantage  of  the  sea  of
information captured during the investment process to improve client service and
gain competitive advantage.

  Advent Browser Reporting for Investors,  introduced in 1998, allows investment
managers to post Axys reports to a secure website where  individual  clients can
access these reports 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Advent Browser Reporting for
Enterprise Users allows investment professionals the ability to access Axys from
remote  locations via the Internet and run Axys reports as if they were in their
office.

MIDDLE OFFICE

    Moxy,  introduced in 1995,  automates and  streamlines the trading and order
management process. Moxy can be integrated with any portfolio accounting system,
facilitates accurate trade order management and preparation,  tracks trade order
status,  automates the allocation of block trades across multiple portfolios and
electronically  interfaces  with Axys to provide an  integrated  solution.  Moxy
supports fixed income,  mutual funds and equity trading and offers multicurrency
capabilities.  Moxy enables  investment  managers to accurately adjust portfolio
holdings,  rebalance  portfolios against models,  interactively assess "what-if"
scenarios  and  automatically  create orders to be executed.  For traders,  Moxy
tracks  cash  and  positions  during  the  trading  day,  enables  the  accurate
preparation of block trades and internal  electronic trade tickets,  facilitates
compliance with investment  restrictions and trading  requirements and minimizes
trading errors. Moxy also allows traders and others to view the status of orders
via  customizable  screens and maintain an  electronic  audit trail of the trade
process.   Moxy  automates  the  allocation  process  of  partial  and  complete
executions and allows the user to send  allocation  results by fax directly from
the  computer  to  brokers  and banks.  Moxy  allows  clients  using  OASYS,  an
electronic   allocation   system,   to   communicate   allocations   to  brokers
electronically. Moxy also provides Internet-ready electronic order routing based
on the  industry  standard FIX  messaging  protocol so that Moxy users can route
trades  electronically  to any  FIX-compliant  broker or crossing  network  that
supports the Internet or other TCP/IP connections. In the future, Moxy will have
additional  electronic  links that  instantly  communicate  trade and allocation
information  to brokers and  custodians.  Moxy  electronically  posts  allocated
trades into Axys on demand,  eliminating  time-consuming  and error-prone manual
entry.

FRONT OFFICE

    Qube,  introduced  in 1995,  is  designed to help  securities  professionals
develop  and improve  client  relationships  by  automating  scheduling,  client
communications   and  client  data.   For  example,   Qube  enables   investment
professionals to interactively  screen client  investment  profiles and notes of
conversations  to  identify   appropriate   candidates  for  various  investment
opportunities.  In  addition,  Qube  can be used  to  enhance  direct  marketing
campaigns by matching clients with market opportunities. Qube captures extensive
investment  profile  information,  has  on-line  query  capability,   networking
features and mail merge capabilities and facilitates  information sharing across
professionals  in an office.  Moreover,  Qube is designed to be integrated  with
Axys,  allowing users to provide  accurate and timely  portfolio  information to
clients.

    Advent Browser Reporting for Decision Makers puts the power of data analysis
on the portfolio  managers  desktop via the Internet.  Using On-line  Analytical
Processing (OLAP) tools,  investment data can be sliced and diced to improve the
decision making process.

GRANTS MANAGEMENT

  Advent's  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  MicroEdge,  acquired  in  February  1998,
provides grants management systems. Gifts for Windows is a proposal tracking and
grants management system that allows the user to retrieve and classify requests,
generate personalized letters, manage contracts, schedule and monitor activities
and maintain  complete  organization  history track payments,  contingencies and
reports  due.  This  software  product is  primarily  used by the  philanthropic
community such as foundations,  corporations  and other  organizations to manage
their grant-making activities.

MAINTENANCE SUPPORT AND DATA INTERFACES

    Advent  earns  recurring  revenues  by  offering  a  choice  of  maintenance
contracts  and by  providing  proprietary  interfaces  to  external  sources  of
critical data. These interfaces allow clients to (i) download pricing, corporate
actions and other data from third party  vendors  such as  Interactive  Data,  a
wholly owned indirect  subsidiary of Pearson plc  (Interactive  Data),  and (ii)
interface with DTC, certain brokerage firms and custodians for trading activity.
Advent  continually  analyzes the ongoing external data needs of its clients and
expects to offer new data products in the future.  Many of Advent's  clients use
Advent's proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data
from  Interactive  Data.  Interactive  Data pays  Advent a  commission  based on
Interactive Data's revenues from providing such data to Advent's clients.

    In November 1998, Advent acquired  HubData,  which  consolidates  securities
information  and data from various  third party  providers  such as Muller Data,
J.J. Kenny,  Interactive  Data and others,  and provides  services to a range of
financial  institutions  via electronic  interfaces to many  portfolio  software
systems.

    Due to the  mission-critical  nature  of  Advent's  products,  many  clients
purchase annual  maintenance  contracts which entitle them to technical  support
and product upgrades as they become available.  Advent continually  upgrades and
enhances its products to respond to changing market needs,  evolving  regulatory
requirements and new technologies.

INTERNET INITIATIVE

    Advent believes that the Internet can be a low-cost  communications platform
to integrate external information into Advent products, thereby providing Advent
clients  with  straight  through  processing  of business  information.  To take
advantage of the Internet, Advent has launched an Internet Initiative whereby it
is developing services, both announced and unannounced,  to bring Internet-based
products and services to clients.  The first of these  services,  Custodial Data
Service,  was launched  during the second  quarter of 1997.  Using the Internet,
Advent's Custodial Data Service consolidates  communication and information from
all  participating  custodians,  enabling  Advent  clients to quickly and easily
reconcile  transactions  and holdings  with a click of the mouse.  The second is
Advent Browser  Reporting,  introduced in 1998.  Advent  Browser  Reporting is a
reporting component of Advent Office, which provides users the ability to access
Advent Office information through a web browser.


                                       5
<PAGE>

    From  time to  time,  as  Advent  begins  development  of new  products  and
services,  including its Internet Initiative, it plans to continue to enter into
development agreements with information  providers,  clients, or other companies
in order to accelerate the delivery of new products and services.

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

    Professional  services  consist of  consulting,  implementation  management,
integration management, custom programming, and training. To ensure a successful
product implementation, consultants assist clients with the initial installation
of a system,  assist  in the  conversion  of the  client's  historical  data and
provide ongoing training and education.  Consulting services may be required for
as  little  as two  days  for  small  systems  or up to  many  weeks  for  large
implementations.  Advent  believes  that its  consulting  services  facilitate a
client's early success with its products,  strengthen the relationship  with the
client and generate valuable feedback for Advent.

    Implementation  management provides a single  point-of-contact who will work
closely with our client's project team to plan the implementation,  optimize the
use of Advent products,  coordinate Advent resources,  advocate on their behalf,
and minimize schedule delays and project risks. Additionally,  an Implementation
Manager will document the implementation from planning through production.

    Integration  management  provides  services  in  implementations  with  more
complex needs.  Integration Managers work with the clients during implementation
to integrate  their systems and  workflows  with Advent  products.  The services
include:  development of custom interfaces from back-office  systems to Advent's
Axys and Moxy products,  configuration  and management of large volumes of data,
and strategies for deployment of Advent products for distributed sites.

    Advent  provides its clients with custom  programming  services  that enable
clients to tailor  end-user  reports to their own  specifications.  Advent  also
provides training sessions to its clients at various sites across the country.

CLIENTS

    Advent's clients vary  significantly in size and assets under management and
include investment advisors,  brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds, corporations,
public funds, universities and non-profit organizations.  At present, Advent has
licensed its products to over 5,400 institutions in 36 countries for use by more
than 30,000 concurrent users.

SALES AND MARKETING

    Sales

    Advent sells its products and services  through a direct sales  organization
comprised of field sales and  telesales  representatives.  Advent's  field sales
force is organized by geographic region and is primarily responsible for selling
Advent Office to mid-sized and large investment management organizations. Advent
has sales offices in San Francisco, CA, New York, NY and Cambridge, MA. Advent's
telesales  organization  is primarily  focused on selling  Advent's  products to
existing   Axys   clients  and  small  and   mid-sized   investment   management
organizations.  Advent's telesales representatives are located in San Francisco,
New York,  Cambridge,  MA and  Melbourne,  Australia.  Advent's  sales  force is
supported by extensive ongoing product and sales training.

    Marketing

    The marketing department is responsible for assessing market  opportunities,
product  planning and management and specific sales support.  In addition to its
traditional marketing functions, the marketing organization is actively involved
in a process called "Market  ValidationSM,"  using a system of interaction  with
and input from potential and existing clients,  product  development,  sales and
client  services  and  support  departments  to define the scope,  features  and
functionality  of new  products  and  product  upgrades.  In  addition,  product
managers  are  responsible  for all phases of a product  life cycle from product
development through product introduction and beyond. The marketing department is
also responsible for corporate  marketing,  including  generating  client leads,
targeted  direct  mail  campaigns,   seminars,   advertising,  trade  shows  and
conferences and public relations  efforts and also provides the sales force with
appropriate written and electronic materials to use during the sales process.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

    In recent years, Advent has substantially  increased its product development
expenditures  in order to  accelerate  the  rate of new  product  introductions,
incorporate new technologies  and sustain the quality of its products.  In 1998,
1997, and 1996,  Advent's product  development  expenditures were  approximately
$12.6  million,  $9.4 million,  and $6.7 million,  respectively.  In addition to
engineering,  quality assurance and documentation,  Advent's product development
activities include the identification and validation of product specifications.

    Advent's  new  products  and product  upgrades  require  varying  degrees of
development time,  depending upon the complexity of the accounting  requirements
and securities  regulations  which they are intended to address,  as well as the
number and type of features  incorporated.  Advent has primarily relied upon the
internal development of its products.  Advent has in the past acquired,  and may
again in the future  acquire,  additional  technologies  or products  from third
parties or consultants.  Advent intends to continue to support industry standard
operating environments, client/server architectures and network protocols.

    There can be no  assurance  that Advent will be  successful  in  developing,
introducing  and marketing new products or product  enhancements on a timely and
cost  effective  basis,  if at  all,  or  that  its  new  products  and  product
enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve
market  acceptance.  Delays in the  commencement of commercial  shipments of new
products or enhancements may result in client  dissatisfaction and delay or loss
of product revenues. If Advent is unable, for technological or other reasons, to
develop and introduce  new products or  enhancements  of existing  products in a
timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client  requirements,
or if new  products or new versions of existing  products do not achieve  market
acceptance,  Advent's business,  operating results and financial condition would
be materially adversely affected.  In addition,  Advent's ability to develop new
products  and  product  enhancements  is  dependent  upon the  products of other
software vendors,  including certain system software vendors,  such as Microsoft
Corporation,  database vendors and development  tool vendors.  In the event that
the products of such vendors have design  defects or flaws,  or if such products
are unexpectedly  delayed in their  introduction,  Advent's business,  operating
results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Software
products as complex as those offered by Advent may contain undetected defects or
errors when first  introduced or as new versions are released.  Although  Advent
has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any software errors,
there can be no  assurance  that,  despite  testing by Advent  and its  clients,
defects  or  errors  will not be found in new  products  after  commencement  of
commercial shipments,  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance, which
could have a material adverse effect upon Advent's  business,  operating results
and financial condition.

COMPETITION

    The market for investment  management  software is segmented by the relative
size of the organizations that manage investment  portfolios.  In addition,  the
market in each segment is intensely  competitive and highly fragmented,  subject
to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product  introductions and marketing
efforts by industry  participants.  Advent's  competitors  include  providers of
software  and  related  services as well as  providers  of  timeshare  services.
Competitors vary in size, scope of services offered and platforms supported.  In
addition,  Advent competes indirectly with existing and potential clients,  many
of whom develop their own software for their  particular needs and therefore may
be reluctant to license software products offered by independent vendors such as
Advent. With respect to the market for its portfolio accounting products, Advent
currently competes primarily with Shaw Data, a division of SunGard Data Systems,
Inc.,  Thomson  Financial,  a division  of The Thomson  Corporation,  and with a
number  of  other  smaller   companies.   Advent  believes  that  the  principal
competitive  factors  affecting  its  market  include  product  performance  and
functionality,  ease of use,  scalability,  ability to integrate  external  data
sources,  product and company reputation,  client service and support and price.
There can be no  assurance  that  Advent  will be able to  compete  successfully
against current and future  competitors or that  competitive  pressures will not
result in price  reductions,  reduced  operating  margins and the loss of market
share,  any one of which could materially  adversely  affect Advent's  business,
operating results and financial condition.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

    Advent's  success  is  dependent  in  part on its  ability  to  protect  its
proprietary  technology.  Advent  relies  on  a  combination  of  copyright  and
trademark  laws,  trade secrets,  software  security  measures,  confidentiality
agreements  and license  agreements  to  establish  and protect its  proprietary
rights  and  its  software.  Despite  these  efforts,  it  may be  possible  for
unauthorized  third parties to copy certain portions of Advent's  products or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use proprietary  information of Advent.
Advent  does not have any  patents,  and  existing  copyright  laws  afford only
limited protection.  In addition,  Advent cannot be certain that others will not
develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology,  or that
equivalent  products will not be marketed in competition with Advent's products,
thereby  substantially  reducing  the  value  of  Advent's  proprietary  rights.
Furthermore,  there  can be no  assurance  that any  confidentiality  agreements
between Advent and its employees or any license agreements with its clients will
provide meaningful  protection of Advent's proprietary  information in the event
of any  unauthorized  use or  disclosure  of such  proprietary  information.  In
addition,  the laws of certain  countries  do not protect  Advent's  proprietary
rights to the same  extent  as do the laws of the  United  States.  Accordingly,
there can be no  assurance  that Advent will be able to protect its  proprietary
software against  unauthorized third party copying or use, which could adversely
affect Advent's business, operating results and financial condition.

EMPLOYEES

    As of December 31, 1998, Advent had 481 full-time employees, including 54 in
sales, 75 in professional services, 43 in marketing, 129 in product development,
109 in client services and support and 71 in finance, administration, operations
and  general   management.   Advent  believes  that  it  maintains   competitive
compensation,  benefits,  equity  participation and work environment policies to
assist in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Advent's success depends
to a significant  extent upon a limited  number of members of senior  management
and other key employees,  including Stephanie DiMarco,  Advent's Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the service of one or more senior
managers or other employees  could have a material  adverse effect upon Advent's
business,  operating results and financial condition. None of Advent's employees
is represented by a labor union.  Advent has not  experienced any work stoppages
and considers its relations with its employees to be good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

    Advent leases office space in facilities in San Francisco, CA, New York, NY,
Millburn, NJ, Cambridge, MA, and Melbourne, Australia. Advent has three separate
leases in San Francisco,  a 59,000 square foot lease that expires in 2008 with a
5 year extension option, a 32,000 square foot lease in an adjacent building that
expires in 2004, and a 60,000 square foot lease that expires in 2009.  These are
Advent's principal  executive  offices,  where product  development,  marketing,
technical support and production are located.  Advent leases two separate office
spaces in New York;  a 12,100  square foot lease and another  5,300  square foot
lease in the same building,  expiring in 2003 and a 28,500 square foot lease for
MicroEdge,  that  expires  in 2008 with a 5 year  extension.  Advent  has a 1000
square foot lease in New Jersey that expires in 2000.  Advent has a 6,700 square
foot lease in  Cambridge,  MA, which  expires in 2003.  In addition,  there is a
4,000 square foot lease in  Melbourne,  Australia  that expires in 2003.  Advent
believes  that its  facilities  are  adequate for its  near-term  needs and that
suitable  additional  or  alternative  space will be  available in the future on
commercially reasonable terms as needed.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

    The  information  required by this Item is  incorporated by reference to the
section entitled  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition
and Results of Operations" in Advent's 1998 Annual Report to Stockholders.

    In addition,  we operate in a rapidly  changing  environment that involves a
number of risks, some of which are beyond our control.  The following discussion
highlights some of these risks.

    Our  operating  results  fluctuate  significantly  and we may not be able to
maintain  our  existing  growth  rates.   Licenses  into  multi-user   networked
environments  have increased both in individual size and number,  the timing and
size of individual  license  transactions  are becoming  increasingly  important
factors in quarterly  operating  results.  The sales cycles for  transactions of
this size are often lengthy and unpredictable. There can be no assurance that we
will be  successful in closing  large  license  transactions  such as these on a
timely basis or at all.  Accordingly,  if in the future revenues from large site
licenses  constitute a material portion of our net revenues,  the timing of such
licenses could cause additional  variability in our quarterly operating results.
Our software  products  typically are shipped  shortly after receipt of a signed
license  agreement  and initial  payment  and,  consequently,  software  product
backlog  at the  beginning  of any  quarter  typically  represents  only a small
portion of that  quarter's  expected  revenues.  Our expense levels are based in
significant  part on our  expectations  of future  revenues  and  therefore  are
relatively  fixed in the short term.  Due to the fixed nature of these  expenses
combined with the relatively  high gross margin  historically  achieved by us on
products  and  services,  an  unanticipated  decline  in  net  revenues  in  any
particular  quarter is likely to  disproportionately  adversely affect operating
results.

    We have  generally  realized  lower  revenues from license fees in the first
quarter of the year than in the immediately  preceding quarter.  We believe that
this has been due  primarily  to the  concentration  by some  clients  of larger
capital  purchases in the fourth  quarter of the  calendar  year and their lower
purchasing  activity during the subsequent first quarter.  We believe our annual
incentive  compensation  plans which result in increased year-end sales activity
compound  this  factor.  Furthermore,  we have often  recognized  a  substantial
portion of our license revenues in the last month of a quarter.

    Due to all of the  foregoing  factors,  we  believe  that  period  to period
comparisons  of our operating  results are not  necessarily  meaningful and that
such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.

    Our stock  price has  fluctuated  significantly  since  the  initial  public
offering in November  1995.  Like many  companies in the technology and emerging
growth sector, our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations, particularly
during  times of high  market  volatility.  If net  revenues  or earnings in any
quarter fail to meet the investment  community's  expectations,  our stock price
could  decline.  In addition,  the stock price may be affected by broader market
trends unrelated to our performance

    We depend heavily on our product, Axys. In 1996, 1997 and 1998, we derived a
substantial  majority of our net revenues from the licensing of Axys and related
products and services.  In addition,  many of our other products,  such as Moxy,
Qube and various data  interfaces  were designed to operate with Axys to provide
an  integrated  solution.  As a 


                                       10

<PAGE>

result,  we believe that a majority of our net revenues,  at least through 1999,
will be dependent  upon continued  market  acceptance of Axys,  enhancements  or
upgrades to Axys and related products and services.

    The success of our new product, Geneva, is uncertain. In 1995, we introduced
Geneva  to  target  organizations  with  complex  international  accounting  and
reporting  requirements,  and in late 1997,  we  announced  its full  commercial
availability.  We are directing a significant amount of our product  development
expenditures  to the  on-going  development  of  Geneva  and  plan to  devote  a
significant  amount of our future sales and  marketing  resources to Geneva.  We
have limited experience in developing products for this market.  Because of such
limited  client  experience,  there can be no  assurance  that  Geneva  will not
require   substantial   software   enhancements  or   modifications  to  satisfy
performance  requirements  of  clients or to fix  design  defects or  previously
undetected errors. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be successful
in marketing Geneva.  Our failure to successfully  market Geneva could adversely
affect our business and operating results.

    We are developing an Internet Initiative. To take advantage of the Internet,
we have launched an Internet Initiative whereby we are developing services, both
announced and  unannounced,  to bring  Internet  based  products and services to
clients. The first of these services, Rex, was launched during the first quarter
of 1997. The second service, Advent Browser Reporting, was launched in the third
quarter of 1998. As we begin  development of new products and services under our
Internet  Initiative,  we have  and will  continue  to  enter  into  development
agreements with information  providers,  clients, or other companies in order to
accelerate the delivery of new products and services.  There can be no assurance
that we will be  successful in marketing  Rex or in  developing  other  Internet
services. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating
results.

    We depend upon new products  and product  enhancements.  Our future  success
will  continue to depend upon our ability to develop new  products  that address
the future  needs of our target  markets  and to  respond to  emerging  industry
standards and practices.  Delays in the commencement of commercial  shipments of
new products or enhancements may result in client  dissatisfaction  and delay or
loss of product revenues.  In addition,  our ability to develop new products and
product  enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software  vendors,
including  certain  system  software  vendors,  such as  Microsoft  Corporation,
database vendors and development tool vendors. In the event that the products of
such vendors have design defects or flaws, or if such products are  unexpectedly
delayed in their  introduction,  our business,  operating  results and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected.

    We depend  upon  financial  markets.  The target  clients  for our  products
include a range of organizations  that manage investment  portfolios,  including
investment  advisors,  brokerage firms,  banks and hedge funds. In addition,  we
target corporations,  public funds,  universities and non-profit  organizations,
which also manage  investment  portfolios  and have many of the same needs.  The
success  of many of our  clients  is  intrinsically  linked to the health of the
financial   markets.   We  believe  that  demand  for  our  products   could  be
disproportionately  affected  by  fluctuations,   disruptions,   instability  or
downturns in the financial markets which may cause clients and potential clients
to exit the  industry or delay,  cancel or reduce any planned  expenditures  for
investment  management systems and software products.  Additionally,  during the
next  twelve  months  there  is  likely  to be an  increased  customer  focus on
addressing  Year 2000 issues,  creating the risk that  customers may  reallocate
capital expenditures to fix Year 2000 problems of existing systems.

    Our relationship with Interactive Data is important. Many of our clients use
our proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data from
Interactive  Data.  Interactive Data pay us a commission based on their revenues
from  providing  such  data to our  clients.  Our  software  products  have been
customized to be compatible with their system and such software would need to be
redesigned if their services were unavailable for any reason.  In the event that
our  relationship  with  Interactive Data were terminated or their services were
unavailable  to our clients for any reason,  replacing  these  services could be
costly and time consuming.

    Our competition is intense. The market for investment management software is
segmented  by the  relative  size of the  organizations  that manage  investment
portfolios. In addition, the market in each segment is intensely competitive and
highly  fragmented,  subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product
introductions  and marketing efforts by industry  participants.  Our competitors
include  providers  of software  and related  services as well as  providers  of
timeshare services.

    Competitors vary in size, scope of services offered and platforms supported.
In addition,  we compete indirectly with existing and potential clients, many of
whom develop their own software for their  particular needs and therefore may be


                                       11
<PAGE>


reluctant to license software  products offered by independent  vendors like us.
Many of our competitors have longer operating  histories and greater  financial,
technical,  sales and marketing  resources than we do. There can be no assurance
that we  will  be  able to  compete  successfully  against  current  and  future
competitors or that competitive  pressures will not result in price  reductions,
reduced  operating  margins  and loss of market  share,  any one of which  could
materially  adversely  affect our  business,  operating  results  and  financial
condition.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

    We  considered  the  provision  of  Financial   Reporting   Release  No.  48
"Disclosure of Accounting  Policies for  Derivative  Financial  Instruments  and
Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative
Information  about Market Risk  Inherent in  Derivative  Financial  Instruments,
Other Financial  Instruments and Derivative  Commodity  Instruments".  We had no
holdings of derivative financial or commodity  instruments at December 31, 1998.
However, we are exposed to financial market risks,  including changes in foreign
currency  exchange  rates and  interest  rates.  Much of our revenue and capital
spending  is  transacted  in U.S.  dollars.  However,  with the  acquisition  of
Portfolio Management Systems, these subsidiary revenues and capital spending are
transacted  in  Australian   dollars.   Results  of  operations  from  Portfolio
Management  Systems are not  material to the  results of  operations  of Advent,
therefore, we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially
adversely affect our overall financial  position,  results of operations or cash
flows.  We believe  that the fair value of our  investment  portfolio or related
income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest
rates due mainly to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio.  However,
a sharp increase in interest  rates could have a material  adverse affect on the
fair value of our investment portfolio.  Conversely,  sharp declines in interest
rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio.

    The table below  presents  principal  amounts by expected  maturity (in U.S.
dollars) and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our
investment portfolio.

                  (g) The term  "Premises"  shall mean the space in the Building
designated by  cross-hatching  on the floor plan(s) attached hereto as Exhibit A
(exclusive of the areas,  if any, shown by shading) and situated on the floor(s)
of the Building specified in Paragraph D of the Summary of Lease Terms, together
with the  appurtenant  right to the use,  in common  with  others,  of  lobbies,

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Landlord  acknowledges  that Tenant intends to
install a new card swipe  security  system in the Premises at Tenant's sole cost

right,  in common with Landlord,  to utilize the stairs and common areas between
each floor of the  Premises  for the  purposes of access,  ingress and egress to
other portions of the Premises, and that no other tenant, person or entity shall

thereof and access  thereto  through the Premises for the purposes of operation,
maintenance and repairs, are reserved to Landlord.

                  (h) The term "Real  Property"  shall mean,  collectively,  the
Land, the Building,  the connected parking garage, and the other improvements on
the Land.

                  (i) The term  "Real  Property  Taxes"  shall  mean all  taxes,
assessments (whether general or special), excises, transit charges, housing fund
assessments or other housing charges, levies or fees, ordinary or extraordinary,
unforeseen  as well as  foreseen,  of any  kind,  which  are  assessed,  levied,
charged,  confirmed or imposed on the Real Property or any part thereof,  on the
Landlord  with respect to the Real  Property,  on the act of entering  into this
Lease or any other lease of space in the Real Property,  on the use or occupancy
of the Real Property or any part thereof,  with respect to services or utilities
consumed in the use,  occupancy  or  operation  of the Real  Property,  or on or
measured by the rent payable under this Lease or in connection with the business
of renting space in the Real Property,  including, without limitation, any gross
income tax or excise tax levied with respect to the receipt of such rent, by the
United States of America,  the State of  California,  the City and County of San
Francisco,  any political  subdivision,  public  corporation,  district or other
political or public entity or public authority, and shall also include any other
tax, fee or other excise, however described,  which may be levied or assessed in
lieu of, as a  substitute  (in whole or in part) for, or as an addition  to, any
other  Real  Property  Taxes.  Real  Property  Taxes  shall  include  reasonable
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements incurred in connection with proceedings
to contest,  determine or reduce Real Property  Taxes,  provided  Landlord shall
have provided  Tenant with written  notice of the estimated  amount of such fees
and the reason for initiating  such  proceedings and Tenant shall have agreed in
writing  after receipt of Landlord  written  notice to pay its pro rata share of
such  fees,  costs  and   disbursements   prior  to  Landlord   commencing  such
proceedings.  If  Tenant  does  not so  agree,  or  Landlord  does  not seek its
agreement,  then  Tenant  shall pay only  such  fees,  costs  and  disbursements
incurred in connection  with  proceedings  which  actually  reduce Real Property
Taxes.

                  Real Property Taxes shall not include income, gift, franchise,
transfer,  inheritance  or capital stock taxes,  unless,  due to a change in the
method of taxation,  any of such taxes is levied or assessed against Landlord in
lieu of, or as a  substitute  (in whole or in part) for,  any other charge which
would otherwise  constitute a part of Real Property  Taxes.  Landlord and Tenant
acknowledge  and agree that certain other  buildings  exist or encroach upon the
Land,  that Tenant shall have no liability as to any item of Real Property Taxes
attributable  or allocable  to, or assessed  against,  buildings  other than the
Building and that, except as set forth in Paragraph 4(c)(ii) hereof,  Landlord's
good faith  determination of the proper  allocation of any item of Real Property
Taxes  allocable  to  buildings  other  than the  Building  shall be  binding on
Landlord and Tenant.  All Real  Property  Taxes which can be 


                                       6.

<PAGE>

paid by Landlord in installments shall be paid by Landlord in the maximum number
of installments  permitted by law and not included as Real Property Taxes except
in the year in which the tax or assessment is actually paid.

                  (j) The term "Rental"  shall include the Basic Monthly  Rental
and the Monthly  Storage Rental set forth in Paragraph J of the Summary of Lease
Terms,  all additional rent, and any other charges payable by Tenant to Landlord
hereunder.

                  (k) The  term  "Storage  Area"  shall  mean  the  Space in the
basement of the Building designated by cross-hatching on the floor plan attached
hereto as Exhibit A-1.

                  (l) The term "Tenant's  Extra  Improvements"  shall mean those
improvements  in  addition  to Building  Standard  Improvements  which are to be
installed  in the  Premises  by  Tenant  at its  sole  cost or  using  a  tenant
improvement allowance provided by Landlord.

                  (m) The  term  "Tenant's  Percentage  Share"  shall  mean  the
percentage figure specified in Paragraph F of the Summary of Lease Terms.

         2.       TERM.

                  (a) The term of this Lease shall  commence  and,  unless ended
sooner as herein provided,  shall expire on the dates respectively  specified in
Paragraph I of the Summary of Lease Terms (respectively  referred to hereinafter
as the  "Commencement  Date" and the  "Expiration  Date").  Landlord  and Tenant
hereby agree to confirm the actual  Commencement  and Expiration  Dates prior to
the  commencement  of the Lease term by executing  and  delivering to each other
counterparts of a Commencement Date Memorandum in the form of Exhibit C attached
hereto,  but the term of this Lease shall commence on the Commencement  Date and
end on the Expiration Date whether or not such amendment is executed.

                  (b) Tenant  shall accept the Premises and the Storage Area "as
is" on the Commencement Date.  Landlord shall have no obligation to construct or
install  any   improvements  in  the  Premises  or  the  Storage  Area.   Tenant
acknowledges that Tenant's possession of the Premises and the Storage Area shall
constitute Tenant's acknowledgment that the Premises and the Storage Area are in
all  respects  in the  condition  in which  Landlord  is required to deliver the
Premises  and the  Storage  Area to Tenant  under this Lease and that Tenant has
examined the  Premises  and the Storage  Area and is fully  informed to Tenant's
satisfaction of the physical and environmental  condition and the utility of the
Premises and the Storage Area. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord, its agents and
employees  and  other  persons  acting  on  behalf  of  Landlord  have  made  no
representation or warranty of any kind in connection with any matter relating to
the physical 


                                       7.

<PAGE>

or environmental condition, value, fitness, use or zoning of the Premises or the
Storage  Area upon which  Tenant  has  relied  directly  or  indirectly  for any
purpose,  except as specifically set forth in this Lease. Landlord hereby agrees
that if at any  time  during  the term of this  Lease  the  Storage  Area is not
suitable  for  Tenant's  intended  purpose  as a result  of any  water  leakage,
flooding or any other  weather  condition,  and Landlord is unable to repair the
Storage Area to prevent the water leakage or flooding  following  written notice
from  Tenant and a  reasonable  period to repair the Storage  Area,  then Tenant
shall have the option to terminate this Lease as to the Storage Area,  whereupon
all of  Tenant's  obligations  under this Lease in  connection  with the Storage
Area,  including,  without  limitation,  Tenant's  obligation to pay the Monthly
Storage Rental,  shall  automatically  terminate,  and Landlord and Tenant shall
enter into an amendment to this Lease memorializing said termination.

         3.       RENTAL; SECURITY DEPOSIT.

                  (a) Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord as Basic  Monthly  Rental
and Monthly  Storage Rental for the Premises and the Storage Area the respective
sums specified in Paragraph J of the Summary of Lease Terms. The Monthly Storage
Rental shall be subject to increase in accordance with Paragraph 3(c) hereof.

                  (b) The Basic Monthly  Rental and the Monthly  Storage  Rental
shall be paid to  Landlord,  in advance,  on or before the first day of each and
every successive calendar month during the term hereof. In the event the term of
this Lease  commences on a day other than the first day of a calendar  month, or
ends on a day  other  than the  last day of a  calendar  month,  then the  Basic
Monthly  Rental  and the  Monthly  Storage  Rental  for the  first  and/or  last
fractional  months  of the  term  shall  be  appropriately  prorated.  All  such
prorations  shall be made on the basis of a 360-day  year  consisting  of twelve
30-day months.

                  (c) The Monthly  Storage Rental payable  pursuant to Paragraph
3(a) hereof  shall be subject to increase as set forth in this  Paragraph  3(c).
Effective  as  of  the  Consumer  Price  Index  (as  hereinafter  defined)  rent
adjustment  date(s)  specified  in  Paragraph K of the Summary of Lease Terms (a
"CPI Adjustment  Date"),  the Monthly Storage Rental shall be the sum of (i) the
Monthly  Storage  Rental  for the  immediately  preceding  month  payable  under
Paragraph 3(a) hereof plus (ii) the product obtained by multiplying such Monthly
Storage Rental by the  percentage  increase in the Consumer Price Index measured
from the last month for which the Consumer Price Index is published  immediately
preceding the  Commencement  Date to the last month for which the Consumer Price
Index is published  immediately  preceding the CPI Adjustment  Date in question.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in no event shall the Monthly  Storage  Rental
after any CPI  Adjustment  Date be less than the Monthly  Storage Rental for the
month immediately  preceding such CPI Adjustment Date.  Landlord and Tenant each
shall,  promptly after any  


                                       8.
<PAGE>

determination  of the Monthly  Storage Rental  pursuant to this Paragraph  3(c),
execute  and deliver to the other a written  amendment  to this Lease which sets
forth the Monthly Storage  Rental,  but such Monthly Storage Rental shall become
effective whether or not such amendment is executed.

         As used in this Lease,  "Consumer  Price Index" shall mean the Consumer
Price  Index for All Urban  Consumers  for the  metropolitan  area in or nearest
which the Building is located, All Items, 1982-1984 equals 100, published by the
United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the comparison
Consumer  Price Index required for the  calculation  specified in Paragraph 3(c)
hereof is not  available on the CPI  Adjustment  Date in question,  Tenant shall
continue to pay the same amount of Monthly  Storage  Rental  payable  during the
period  immediately  preceding  the CPI  Adjustment  Date in question  until the
Consumer Price Index is available and the necessary calculation is made. As soon
as such calculation is made, Tenant shall immediately pay to Landlord the amount
of any  underpayment  of Monthly Storage Rental for the month or months that may
have elapsed  pending the  calculation of the Monthly Storage Rental for the CPI
Adjustment  Date in  question.  If the federal  government  revises or ceases to
publish the Consumer  Price Index,  Landlord may  substitute  any  substantially
equivalent  official  index  published by the Bureau of Labor  Statistics or its
successors  and  Landlord  shall  use  any  appropriate  conversion  factors  to
accomplish such substitution.  The substitute index shall thereafter  constitute
the "Consumer Price Index" hereunder.

                  (d) Rental shall be paid to Landlord  without notice,  demand,
deduction  or  offset  in  lawful  money of the  United  States  in  immediately
available funds or by good check as described below at the office of Landlord at
Landlord's  address for notices  specified in the Summary of Lease Terms,  or to
such  other  person or at such  other  place as  Landlord  from time to time may
designate  in  writing.  Payments  made by  check  must  be  drawn  either  on a
California financial  institution or on a financial institution that is a member
of the federal  reserve  system.  All  amounts of Rental,  if not paid when due,
shall bear  interest  from the due date until paid at an annual rate of interest
(the  "Interest  Rate") equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum  annual  interest
rate  allowed  by law on such due date for  business  loans (not  primarily  for
personal, family or household purposes) not exempt from the usury law, or (ii) a
rate equal to the sum of five (5) percentage points over the publicly  announced
reference  rate  (the  "Reference  Rate")  charged  on such  due date by the San
Francisco Main Office of Bank of America NT & SA (or any successor bank thereto)
(or if there is no such publicly announced rate, the rate quoted by such bank in
pricing ninety (90) day commercial loans to substantial  commercial  borrowers).
In  addition,  Tenant  acknowledges  that late  payment by Tenant to Landlord of
Rental will cause Landlord to incur costs not  contemplated  by this Lease,  the
exact amount of such 


                                       9.
<PAGE>

costs being extremely difficult to fix. Such costs include,  without limitation,
processing  and  accounting  charges,  and late  charges  that may be imposed on
Landlord by the terms of any  encumbrance  and/or note secured by an encumbrance
covering the Premises.  Therefore,  if any installment of Rental due from Tenant
is not received within ten (10) days after Tenant  receives  written notice from
Landlord  of the amount  past due and owing,  Tenant  shall pay to  Landlord  an
additional  sum of five  percent  (5%) of the overdue  Rental as a late  charge;
provided  that,  if Rental is not paid when due one (1) time during any calendar
year during the term of this Lease,  then  thereafter  for the remainder of such
calendar year Tenant shall not be entitled to such notice and ten (10) day grace
period,  and such late  charge  shall be assessed on any Rental not paid by 5:00
p.m. on the date due. Commencing on the immediately following calendar year, the
notice requirement  described above shall be reinstated.  The parties agree that
this late charge  represents  a fair and  reasonable  estimate of the costs that
Landlord will incur by reason of late payment of Rental by Tenant. Acceptance of
any late charge shall not  constitute a waiver of Tenant's  default with respect
to the overdue  amount,  or prevent  Landlord from  exercising  any of the other
rights and remedies available to Landlord.

                  (e) On or before the  Commencement  Date,  Tenant shall pay to
Landlord (a) an amount equal to the Basic Monthly Rental and the Monthly Storage
Rental for the first  month of the term of this  Lease,  which  amount  Landlord
shall apply to the Basic Monthly Rental and the Monthly  Storage Rental for such
first month, and (b) the amount of the security deposit specified in Paragraph L
of the Summary of Lease Terms (the "Deposit").  Failure to pay either the Rental
for the first  month of the term of the Lease or the  Deposit  on or before  the
Commencement  Date shall be deemed an Event of Default (as defined in  Paragraph
18(a))  under the Lease.  The Deposit  shall be held by Landlord as security for
the faithful  performance by Tenant of all of the provisions of this Lease to be
performed or observed by Tenant. If Tenant fails to pay any Rental, or otherwise
defaults  with respect to any  provision of this Lease,  Landlord may (but shall
not be obligated to) use,  apply or retain all or any portion of the Deposit for
the  payment of any  Rental in  default  or for the  payment of any other sum to
which  Landlord  may  become  obligated  by reason of  Tenant's  default,  or to
compensate Landlord for any loss or damage which Landlord may suffer thereby. If
Landlord  so uses or applies  all or any portion of the  Deposit,  Tenant  shall
within ten (10) days after  demand  therefor  deposit  cash with  Landlord in an
amount  sufficient  to restore  the  Deposit  to the full  amount  thereof,  and
Tenant's  failure to do so shall, at Landlord's  option,  be an Event of Default
(as  defined in  Paragraph  18(a))  under this  Lease.  Landlord  shall keep the
Security Deposit separate from its general accounts in a money market account of
its choosing  ("Security  Deposit Account") and shall remit any interest payable
thereunder to Tenant upon the  Expiration  Date or earlier  termination  of this
Lease.  If 


                                      10.

<PAGE>

Landlord  exhausts the Security  Deposit in paying any sums specified under this
Lease,  Landlord may use any interest accrued in the Security Deposit Account to
pay any sums remaining  owing.  If Tenant  performs all of Tenant's  obligations
hereunder,  the Deposit and the accrued interest,  or so much thereof as has not
theretofore  been  applied by  Landlord,  shall be  returned  to Tenant  (or, at
Landlord's option, to the last assignee, if any, of Tenant's interest hereunder,
unless the assignment agreement  specifically requires that the Security Deposit
be returned to Tenant and Landlord  shall have  consented  to such  agreement in
writing) at the  expiration or sooner  termination  of the term hereof and after
Tenant has  vacated  the  Premises.  Landlord's  return of the  Deposit  and the
accrued interest or any part thereof shall not be construed as an admission that
Tenant  has  performed  all  of its  obligations  under  this  Lease.  No  trust
relationship  is created herein between  Landlord and Tenant with respect to the
Deposit.

         4.       TENANT'S SHARE OF OPERATING EXPENSES AND REAL PROPERTY TAXES.

                  (a) In  addition  to the  Basic  Monthly  Rental  and  Monthly
Storage  Rental  payable  during  the term of this  Lease,  Tenant  shall pay to
Landlord,  as additional rent,  Tenant's  Percentage Share of (i) the amount, if
any, by which  Operating  Expenses  paid or incurred by Landlord in any calendar
year subsequent to the Base Expense Year exceed the amount of Operating Expenses
paid or incurred by Landlord  during the Base Expense Year, and (ii) the amount,
if any,  by which Real  Property  Taxes paid or  incurred by Landlord in any tax
year (July 1 through June 30)  subsequent to the Base Tax Year exceed the amount
of Real  Property  Taxes paid or incurred by Landlord  during the Base Tax Year.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Building is less than 100% occupied in any
year during the term of this Lease, the variable costs included within Operating
Expenses and Real Property  Taxes for such year shall be adjusted,  for purposes
of the  foregoing  calculation,  to the amount which they would have been if the
Building  had been  100%  occupied.  If it shall  not be  lawful  for  Tenant to
reimburse  Landlord for any increase in Real Property  Taxes as defined  herein,
the Basic Monthly  Rental  payable to Landlord  prior to the  imposition of such
increases in Real Property Taxes shall be increased to net Landlord the same net
Basic Monthly  Rental after  imposition of such increases in Real Property Taxes
as  would  have  been  received  by  Landlord  prior to the  imposition  of such
increases in Real Property Taxes.

                  (b)  During   December  of  each  calendar  year  or  as  soon
thereafter as practicable,  Landlord shall give Tenant notice of its estimate of
the  amounts  payable  by  Tenant  pursuant  to  Paragraph  4(a)  above  for the
succeeding  calendar  year.  On or before the first day of each month during the
succeeding calendar year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord,  as additional rent, one
twelfth  (1/12) of such  estimated  amounts.  If Landlord  fails 


                                      11.

<PAGE>

to deliver  such  notice to Tenant in  December,  Tenant  shall  continue to pay
Tenant's  Percentage Share of increases in Operating  Expenses and Real Property
Taxes on the basis of the prior year's  estimate until the first day of the next
calendar  month  after such notice is given,  provided  that on such date Tenant
shall  pay to  Landlord  the  amount of such  estimated  adjustment  payable  to
Landlord for prior months during the year in question,  less any portion thereof
previously  paid by  Tenant.  If at any time it  appears  to  Landlord  that the
amounts  payable under this  Paragraph  4(b) for the current  calendar year will
vary from Landlord's estimate, Landlord may, by giving written notice to Tenant,
revise Landlord's  estimate for such year, and subsequent payments by Tenant for
such year shall be based on such revised estimate.

                  (c) (i)  Within  ninety  (90)  days  after  the  close of each
calendar  year or as soon after  such  ninety  (90) day  period as  practicable,
Landlord  shall  deliver to Tenant a  statement  of the  amounts  payable  under
Paragraph 4(a) above for such calendar year (an "annual statement") and, subject
to Paragraph  4(c)(ii),  such statement shall be final and binding upon Landlord
and Tenant. If on the basis of such statement Tenant owes an amount that is more
than the estimated  payments for such calendar year  previously  made by Tenant,
Tenant  shall pay the  deficiency  to Landlord  within  fifteen  (15) days after
delivery of the statement.  If on the basis of such statement Tenant has paid to
Landlord an amount in excess of the amounts  payable under  Paragraph 4(a) above
for the preceding  calendar year and no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing,  then Landlord,  at its option, shall either promptly refund such
excess to Tenant or credit the amount  thereof to the Basic Monthly  Rental next
becoming due from Tenant until such credit has been exhausted.

         (ii)  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary in this Lease,  Tenant
shall have the right, during the ninety (90) day period following delivery of an
annual  statement,  to deliver a written request to Landlord to audit Landlord's
records  of  Operating   Expenses  and  Real  Property  Taxes  ("Tenant's  Audit
Request").  Within the sixty (60) day period  following  Tenant's  Audit Request
(the "Audit  Period"),  Tenant shall have the right,  at Tenant's  sole cost, to
review in Landlord's  offices  Landlord's records of Operating Expenses and Real
Property Taxes for the subject  calendar year.  Such review shall be carried out
only by regular  employees of Tenant or by a major  national or regional firm of
certified  public  accountants,  and not by any other third party.  No such firm
shall be compensated on a contingency or other  incentive  basis.  If, as of the
ninetieth  (90th) day after  delivery to Tenant of an annual  statement,  Tenant
shall not have delivered to Landlord  Tenant's  Audit Request,  then such annual
statement shall be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant,  and Tenant shall
have no further right to audit or object to such annual statement. If within the
Audit  Period,  Tenant  delivers  to  Landlord  a written  statement  


                                      12.

<PAGE>

specifying objections to such annual statement (an "objection statement"),  then
Tenant and  Landlord  shall meet to attempt  to resolve  such  objection  within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the objection statement. If such objection is
not  resolved  within such thirty  (30) day period,  then Tenant  shall have the
right,  at Tenant's  cost,  to require  that the dispute be submitted to binding
determination by an independent  certified public accountant ("CPA") approved by
Landlord and Tenant.  Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable charges
of the CPA in connection  with such binding  determination  if, but only if, the
CPA shall have  determined that the aggregate  amount of all Operating  Expenses
and Real  Property  Taxes  payable by Tenant for the subject year in  accordance
with the  annual  statement  exceeds  one  hundred  five  percent  (105%) of the
aggregate  amount of all Operating  Expenses and Real Property  Taxes payable by
Tenant for the subject year in accordance with the CPA's determination. Landlord
and Tenant agree that such  determination by a CPA shall be the exclusive method
of resolving  disputes under this Paragraph  4(c). If Tenant does not elect,  by
notice to Landlord  within one hundred  eighty-one  (181) days after delivery of
the annual  statement,  to require such binding  determination,  then the annual
statement  shall be final and  binding.  Notwithstanding  that any such  dispute
remains  unresolved,  Tenant  shall be obligated to pay Landlord the full amount
claimed by Landlord as and when payable in accordance  with this Paragraph 4(c),
but Landlord shall reimburse  Tenant any amount  determined,  in accordance with
this Paragraph 4(c)(ii), to be an overpayment.

                  (d) If this Lease  terminates on a day other than the last day
of a calendar  year,  the amounts  payable by Tenant under  Paragraph 4(a) above
with  respect to the  calendar  year in which such  termination  occurs shall be
prorated  on the basis  which the number of days from the  commencement  of such
calendar  year,  to and  including  such  termination  date,  bears to 360.  The
termination  of this Lease  shall not affect the  obligations  of  Landlord  and
Tenant pursuant to Paragraph 4(c) above to be performed after such termination.

                  (e) It is the  intention of Landlord and Tenant that the Basic
Monthly  Rental  paid to  Landlord  throughout  the term of this Lease  shall be
absolutely net of all increases,  respectively, in Real Property Taxes over Real
Property  Taxes for the Base Tax Year and of Operating  Expenses over  Operating
Expenses  for the  Base  Expense  Year,  and the  foregoing  provisions  of this
Paragraph 4 are intended to so provide.

         5. OTHER TAXES PAYABLE BY TENANT.  Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon
demand for any and all taxes, but not including Real Property Taxes,  payable by
Landlord  (other than net income,  gift,  franchise,  transfer,  inheritance  or
capital stock taxes) whether or not now customary or within the contemplation of
the parties hereto:

                                      13.
<PAGE>

                  (a) imposed upon,  measured by or reasonably  attributable  to
the cost or value of Tenant's equipment,  furniture, fixtures and other personal
property  located  in the  Premises  or by the cost or  value  of any  leasehold
improvements  made in or to the Premises by or for Tenant,  other than  Building
Standard  Improvements  made by Landlord,  regardless  of whether  title to such
improvements shall be in Tenant or Landlord;

                  (b)  imposed  upon or  measured  by the Basic  Monthly  Rental
payable hereunder, including, without limitation, any gross income tax or excise
tax levied by the City and County of San Francisco, the State of California, the
federal government or any other governmental body with respect to the receipt of
such rental to the extent such are not Real Property Taxes;

                  (c) imposed upon or with respect to the  possession,  leasing,
operation,  management,  maintenance,  alteration,  repair,  use or occupancy by
Tenant of the Premises or any portion thereof; or

                  (d) imposed  upon this  transaction  or any  document to which
Tenant is a party  creating  or  transferring  an  interest  or an estate in the
Premises.

         In the event  that it shall not be lawful  for  Tenant to so  reimburse
Landlord, the Basic Monthly Rental payable to Landlord under this Lease shall be
revised to net Landlord the same income  after  imposition  of any such tax upon
Landlord  as  would  have  been  received  by  Landlord  hereunder  prior to the
imposition of any such tax.

         6. USE.  Tenant agrees to use the Premises for general office  purposes
which may include software engineering,  diskette duplication, and packaging and
shipping operations, and agrees not to use nor permit the use of the Premises or
any part thereof for any other purpose.  Tenant agrees not to do or permit to be
done in or about the Premises, the Storage Area or the Building, nor to bring or
keep or permit to be brought or kept in or about the  Premises or the  Building,
anything  which  is  prohibited  by or will in any way  conflict  with  any law,
statute or  governmental  regulation  now or  hereafter  in effect,  or which is
prohibited by the standard form of fire insurance  policy,  or which will in any
way  increase  the  existing  rate of (or  otherwise  affect)  fire or any other
insurance on the Building or any of its  contents,  unless  Tenant agrees to pay
the cost of said increase.  If any act or omission of Tenant results in any such
increase in premium  rates,  Tenant shall pay to Landlord,  as additional  rent,
upon demand the amount of such increase to the extent  attributable  to Tenant's
acts or omissions.  Tenant agrees not to do or permit to be done anything in, on
or about the  Premises,  the Storage Area or the Building  which will in any way
obstruct  or  interfere  with the rights of other  tenants or  occupants  of the
Building, or injure them, or use or allow the Premises or the Storage Area to be
used for any unlawful  


                                      14.

purpose.  Tenant agrees not to cause,  maintain or permit any nuisance in, on or
about the Premises, the Storage Area or the Building, nor to use or permit to be
used any  loudspeaker  or other device,  system or apparatus  which can be heard
outside the Premises or the Storage Area  without the prior  written  consent of
Landlord nor to permit any objectionable  odors,  bright lights or electrical or
radio interference which may annoy or interfere with the rights of other tenants
of the  Building  or the  public.  Tenant  agrees  not to commit or suffer to be
committed any waste in or upon the Premises or the Storage Area.  The provisions
of this  Paragraph  6 are for the  benefit  of  Landlord  only and  shall not be
construed to be for the benefit of any tenant or occupant of the Building.

         7.       COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS/ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  (a) Tenant  agrees at its sole cost and  expense  to  promptly
comply with all laws, statutes,  ordinances and governmental rules,  regulations
or  requirements  now or  hereafter  constituted  affecting  the Premises or the
Storage Area, insofar as any thereof relates to or affects the condition, use or
occupancy of the Premises or the Storage  Area,  excluding  all  obligations  to
alter or improve the Premises or the Storage Area which are  necessitated due to
reasons other than Tenant's  improvements  or particular  use of the Premises or
the Storage  Area.  The judgment of any court of competent  jurisdiction  or the
admission of Tenant in any action  against Tenant  (whether  Landlord be a party
thereto or not) that Tenant has  violated  any such law,  statute,  ordinance or
governmental rule,  regulation,  requirement,  direction or provision,  shall be
conclusive  of that fact as between  Landlord  and Tenant.  If  Tenant's  use or
operation  of the  Premises  or the Storage  Area or any of  Tenant's  equipment
therein requires a governmental  permit,  license or other  authorization or any
notice to any governmental agency,  Tenant shall promptly provide a copy thereof
to Landlord. Tenant agrees not to violate any direction or occupancy certificate
issued  pursuant to law by any public officer and any covenants,  conditions and
restrictions recorded against the Real Property.  Landlord warrants that, to its
actual  knowledge as of the date of this Lease, no notices from any governmental
agency have been issued  regarding the Real  Property  being in violation of any
"environmental  laws" (as hereinafter  defined).  Landlord  warrants that to its
actual  knowledge as of the  Commencement  Date, it has not received any notices
that the Real  Property is not in compliance  with  applicable  laws,  including
environmental  laws.  Landlord's  "actual knowledge" as used in this Lease shall
mean the actual knowledge of the principals of Landlord.

                  (b) Tenant shall not bring or keep, or permit to be brought or
kept,  in the  Premises,  in the Storage Area or in or on the Real  Property any
"hazardous  substance" (as hereinafter  defined).  Tenant and Landlord shall not
manufacture,  generate,  treat,  handle,  store  or  dispose  of  any  hazardous
substance in the  Premises,  in the Storage Area or in or on the Real  Property,


                                      15.

<PAGE>


except for normal and customary amounts of those hazardous  substances typically
used in general office use, including,  without limitation,  office and cleaning
supplies,  provided  such  substances  are  stored,  used  and  disposed  of  in
compliance with all environmental  laws, or use the Premises or the Storage Area
for any such purpose, or emit, release or discharge any hazardous substance into
any air, soil, surface water or groundwater  comprising the Premises or the Real
Property,  or permit any person using or occupying the Premises to do any of the
foregoing.  Tenant shall comply,  and shall cause all persons using or occupying
the  Premises  or the  Storage  Area to  comply,  with  all  environmental  laws
applicable  to the  Premises or the Storage  Area,  the use or  occupancy of the
Premises or the Storage Area or any operation or activity therein.  Tenant shall
indemnify,  defend  and hold  Landlord  harmless  from and  against  any and all
claims,  judgements,  damages,  penalties,  fines,  liabilities,  losses, suits,
administrative  proceedings and costs (including but not limited to,  reasonable
attorneys'  and  consultants'  fees) incurred by Landlord due to the presence of
any hazardous  substance on the Real Property to the extent  resulting  from the
acts or omissions of Tenant, its employees, agents, representatives, contractors
and/or invitees.  Landlord shall indemnify, defend and hold Tenant harmless from
and  against  any  and  all  claims,  judgements,   damages,  penalties,  fines,
liabilities,  losses, suits, administrative proceedings and costs (including but
not limited to, reasonable  attorneys' and consultants' fees) incurred by Tenant
due to the  presence  of any  hazardous  substance  on the Real  Property to the
extent resulting from the acts or omissions of Landlord, its employees,  agents,
representatives,  contractors and/or invitees;  provided, however, that Landlord
shall not be obligated to indemnify,  defend and hold  harmless  Tenant from and
against the acts or omission of third party  unaffiliated  with  Landlord,  when
such acts or omissions are imputed to Landlord by operation of law or otherwise,
or because  Landlord is the record  owner of the  Building.  In such event,  the
foregoing  indemnity  shall  not  apply.  As  used  in  this  Lease,  "hazardous
substance"  shall mean any  substance or material  that is described as a toxic,
hazardous,  corrosive,  ignitable,  flammable  or reactive  substance,  waste or
material or a pollutant or contaminant,  or words of similar  import,  in any of
the environmental  laws, and includes asbestos,  petroleum,  petroleum products,
polychlorinated  biphenyls,  radon gas,  radioactive matter, and chemicals which
may cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. As used in this Lease, "environmental
laws"  shall  mean all  federal,  state and local  laws,  ordinances,  rules and
regulations  now or hereafter in force, as amended from time to time, in any way
relating to or  regulating  human  health or safety,  or  industrial  hygiene or
environmental  conditions,  or  protection of the  environment,  or pollution or
contamination of the air, soil, surface water or groundwater.

                  (c) Tenant shall  immediately  furnish  Landlord  with any (i)
notices received from any insurance company or govern-


                                      16.

mental agency or inspection  bureau regarding any unsafe or unlawful  conditions
within  the   Premises  or  the  Storage   Area,   and  (ii)  notices  or  other
communications  sent  by or on  behalf  of  Tenant  to any  agency  relating  to
environmental laws or hazardous substances affecting the Premises.

                  (d) California  law requires  landlords to disclose to tenants
the existence of certain  hazardous  substances.  Accordingly,  the existence of
gasoline and other automotive fluids, asbestos containing materials, maintenance
fluids,  copying  fluids  and  other  office  supplies  and  equipment,  certain
construction and finish materials,  tobacco smoke,  cosmetics and other personal
items must be disclosed.  Gasoline and other automotive  fluids are found in the
basement garage area of the Building. Cleaning, lubricating and hydraulic fluids
used in the operation and  maintenance  of the Building are found in the utility
areas of the  Building not  generally  accessible  to Building  occupants or the
public.  Many Building  occupants use copy machines and printers with associated
fluids and  toners,  and pens,  markers,  inks,  and office  equipment  that may
contain hazardous substances.  Certain adhesives,  paints and other construction
materials  and finishes  used in portions of the Building may contain  hazardous
substances.  Although smoking is prohibited in the public areas of the Building,
these  areas  may  from  time to time be  exposed  to  tobacco  smoke.  Building
occupants and other  persons  entering the Building from time to time may use or
carry prescription and  non-prescription  drugs,  perfumes,  cosmetics and other
toiletries,  and  foods  and  beverages,  some of which  may  contain  hazardous
substances.

                  (e) The  provisions of this Paragraph 7 are for the benefit of
Landlord and Tenant only and shall not be construed to be for the benefit of any
other tenant or occupant of the Building.

         8.       ALTERATIONS; LIENS.

                  (a)  Tenant  agrees  not to make  or  suffer  to be  made  any
alteration,  addition or  improvement  to or of the Premises or the Storage Area
(hereinafter  referred to as  "Alterations"),  or any part thereof,  without the
prior  written  consent of Landlord,  which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably
withheld or delayed;  provided,  however,  that Landlord's  consent shall not be
required for Alterations  which are not  structural,  do not affect the Building
systems and do not affect the  appearance of the exterior of the  Building.  For
Alterations  which  require  Landlord's  consent and which  involve  engineering
changes to the Premises or the Building, Tenant shall submit to Landlord written
notice of its  proposed  Alterations,  including  all  plans and  specifications
therefor.  Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of its approval or reasonable
disapproval  of such  Alterations  within  thirty  (30) days of  receiving  such
notice.  If Landlord does not indicate its approval or  disapproval  within such
time  period,   Tenant  shall  send  Landlord  a  second  notice  


                                      17.

<PAGE>

regarding  the  Alterations,  and if  Landlord  does not  approve or  reasonably
disapprove  the  Alterations  within  ten (10)  days of  receiving  this  second
notification,  the  Alterations  shall  be  deemed  approved  by  Landlord.  For
Alterations  which  require   Landlord's   consent  and  which  do  not  involve
engineering  changes,  Tenant  shall  submit to Landlord  written  notice of its
proposed  Alterations,  including all plans and  specifications  therefor to the
extent such plans and specifications are necessary. Landlord shall notify Tenant
in writing of its approval or reasonable  disapproval of such Alterations within
twenty (20) days of  receiving  such notice.  If Landlord  does not indicate its
approval or reasonable  disapproval  within such time period,  Tenant shall send
Landlord a second  notice  regarding the  Alterations,  and if Landlord does not
approve or  reasonably  disapprove  of the  Alterations  within ten (10) days of
receiving this second notification,  the Alterations shall be deemed approved by
Landlord.  In its approval of any Alteration,  Landlord shall indicate to Tenant
whether such approval is conditioned  upon Tenant  removing such Alteration upon
the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease.

         If  Landlord  consents  to the  making  of any  Alterations  or if such
consent is not required, the same shall be designed and constructed or installed
by  Tenant  at its  expense  (including  expenses  incurred  in  complying  with
applicable  laws,  including laws relating to the handling and disposal of ACM).
When Tenant submits its plans and  specifications  to Landlord for its approval,
Tenant also shall submit the name of the general  contractor  Tenant  desires to
use to construct the Alterations. Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing of its
approval or reasonable disapproval of such contractor within twenty (20) days of
receiving such notice.  If Landlord does not indicate its approval or reasonable
disapproval  of such  contractor  within  such time  period,  Tenant  shall send
Landlord a second notice regarding the general contractor,  and if Landlord does
not approve or reasonably  disapprove of such contractor within ten (10) days of
receiving  this  second  notification,  the general  contractor  shall be deemed
approved by  Landlord.  All  Alterations  shall be designed and  constructed  in
compliance with all applicable codes, laws,  ordinances,  rules and regulations.
The design and construction of any Alterations  shall be performed in accordance
with Landlord's  applicable and reasonable rules,  regulations and requirements,
including  the  Asbestos  Rules,  to the  extent  such  rules,  regulations  and
requirements  are available  and a copy of same is provided to Tenant.  Under no
circumstances  shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any damage,  loss, cost or
expense  incurred  by Tenant on account of  Tenant's  plans and  specifications,
Tenant's contractors or subcontractors,  design of any work, construction of any
work, or delay in completion of any work. All sums due to such  contractors,  if
paid by  Landlord  due to  Tenant's  failure to pay such sums when due and after
written notice thereof to Tenant, shall bear interest payable to Landlord at the
Interest Rate until fully paid.


                                      18.

<PAGE>


         Upon the expiration or earlier  termination of this Lease,  Tenant,  at
its  expense,  shall  promptly  remove any such  Alterations  made by Tenant and
designated  by  Landlord  to be so  removed,  repair any damage to the  Premises
caused by such  removal and restore the area of the removal to a condition  such
that the  Premises  could be occupied by another  tenant.  Tenant  shall use the
general contractor designated by Landlord or any other construction professional
reasonably  approved by Landlord  for such  removal and repair.  Notwithstanding
anything to the  contrary  in this Lease,  Tenant  shall have no  obligation  to
remove any Alterations  existing as of the Commencement  Date or any Alterations
approved by Landlord  during the term of this Lease unless such  approval,  when
given,  was expressly  conditioned upon Tenant's removal of such Alteration upon
the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Lease,  Tenant shall be required to remove any  alteration,
addition or improvement to or of the Premises or the Storage Area made after the
Commencement  Date for  which  Tenant  does not seek  Landlord's  prior  written
approval or for which Landlord  conditioned its approval thereof upon removal of
the Alteration upon the expiration of earlier  termination of the Lease.  Except
for  Alterations  which  cannot  be  removed  without  structural  injury to the
Premises,  at any time Tenant may remove from the Premises,  the Storage Area or
the  License  Area (as  defined  in Exhibit  D) any  property  of Tenant and any
Alterations,  trade fixtures,  equipment,  furniture or furnishings  that Tenant
installed  in the  Premises,  the Storage  Area or the License Area at any time,
including  prior to the  Commencement  Date,  provided  Tenant complies with the
provisions of this Paragraph 8(a).

         All trade  fixtures,  equipment,  furniture,  furnishings  and personal
property  installed  in the  Premises,  the Storage  Area or the License Area at
Tenant's  expense  ("Tenant's  Property")  shall at all  times  remain  Tenant's
property  and Tenant  shall be entitled to all  depreciation,  amortization  and
other tax  benefits  with  respect  thereto.  Tenant  shall be  entitled  to all
insurance proceeds and condemnation  awards and settlements payable with respect
to Tenant's Property and any Alteration,  trade fixtures,  equipment,  furniture
and  furnishings  installed by Tenant in the  Premises,  the Storage Area or the
License Area at any time,  including prior to the  Commencement  Date.  Landlord
shall  have  no  lien or  other  interest  whatsoever  in any  item of  Tenant's
Property,  or any portion thereof or interest therein located in the Premises or
elsewhere,  and Landlord hereby waives all such liens and interests.  Within ten
(10) days following Tenant's request, Landlord shall execute documents in a form
reasonably  acceptable to Landlord and Tenant to evidence  Landlord's  waiver of
any right, title, lien or interest in Tenant's Property located in the Premises.

                  (b) Tenant  agrees to keep the Premises and the Real  Property
free from any liens arising out of any work  performed,  materials  furnished or
obligations  incurred  by  Tenant. Tenant 


                                      19.

<PAGE>

shall  promptly  and fully pay and  discharge  all claims on which any such lien
could be  based.  In the  event  that  Tenant  does  not,  within  ten (10) days
following  the  recording  of  notice  of any such  lien,  cause  the same to be
released  of record,  Landlord  shall have,  in  addition to all other  remedies
provided herein and by law, the right, but not the obligation, to cause the same
to be released by such means as it shall deem proper,  including  payment of the
claim giving rise to such lien. All sums paid by Landlord for such purpose,  and
all  expenses  incurred  by it in  connection  therewith,  shall be  payable  to
Landlord by Tenant, as additional rent, on demand, together with interest at the
Interest  Rate from the date such  expenses are incurred by Landlord to the date
of the payment  thereof by Tenant to Landlord.  Landlord shall have the right at
all times to post and keep  posted on the  Premises  any  notices  permitted  or
required  by law, or which  Landlord  shall deem  proper for the  protection  of
Landlord, the Premises, the Building, or the Real Property,  from mechanic's and
materialmen's and like liens. Tenant shall give Landlord at least ten (10) days'
prior written  notice of the date of  commencement  of any  construction  on the
Premises in order to permit the posting of such notices.

         9.       MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.

                  (a) Excepting  the  requirements  under the Lease  relating to
Landlord's  repair  obligations,  by taking  possession  of the Premises and the
Storage Area,  Tenant  accepts the Premises and the Storage Area as being in the
condition in which Landlord is obligated to deliver the Premises and the Storage
Area.  Tenant,  at its  expense,  shall at all times keep the  Premises  and the
Storage Area and every part thereof and all equipment, fixtures and improvements
therein in good and sanitary order, condition and repair, damage thereto by acts
of God,  casualties,  and  condemnation  excepted,  and Tenant waives all rights
under, and benefits of,  subsection 1 of Section 1932 and Sections 1941 and 1942
of the  California  Civil Code and under any  similar  law or  ordinance  now or
hereafter in effect.  Upon the  expiration or sooner  termination of this Lease,
Tenant shall surrender the Premises and the Storage Area and (unless  designated
by  Landlord  to be  removed  or Tenant  elected  to remove in  accordance  with
Paragraph 8 above) all Alterations  thereto to Landlord in the same condition as
when  received,  damage  thereto by fire,  the perils of the  extended  coverage
endorsement,  earthquake,  ordinary  wear  and  tear,  acts of God,  casualties,
condemnation,  and  Alterations  which  Tenant is not  required  to remove,  all
excepted.  It is  agreed  that  Landlord  has no  obligation,  and  has  made no
promises,  to alter,  add to, remodel,  improve,  repair,  decorate or paint the
Premises or the  Storage  Area or any part  thereof and that no  representations
respecting the condition of the Premises,  the Storage Area, the Building or the
Real Property have been made by Landlord to Tenant except as may be specifically
set forth in this  Lease.  Landlord  shall  refurbish  the  common  areas of the
Building including, without limitation, the lobby on or before July 1, 1999. The
scope of 


                                      20.

<PAGE>


such  refurbishment   shall  be  determined  in  Landlord's  sole  and  absolute
discretion.  The cost of said refurbishment shall be at the Landlord's sole cost
and expense and shall not constitute an Operating  Expense under this Lease.  No
representation or warranty,  express or implied, is made with respect to (i) the
condition of the Premises,  the Storage Area, or the Building,  (ii) the fitness
of the Premises or the Storage Area for Tenant's  intended use, (iii) the degree
of sound transfer  within the Building,  (iv) the absence of electrical or radio
interference  in the Premises or the Building,  (v) the  condition,  capacity or
performance of electrical or communications  systems or facilities,  or (vi) the
absence of  objectionable  odors,  bright lights or other  conditions  which may
affect  Tenant's  use and  enjoyment  of the  Premises,  the Storage Area or the
Building.

                  (b)  Landlord  agrees  to make all  necessary  repairs  to the
structure (including the roof, exterior walls and foundation), the exterior, and
the public and common areas of the Building and the building systems (including,
without  limitation,  the mechanical,  electrical,  elevator,  plumbing,  sewer,
heating and air conditioning  systems to the extent such systems constitute base
building  systems  as  described  on Exhibit E  attached  hereto (as  opposed to
systems relating to local  distribution  within the Premises))  therein,  and to
maintain the same in reasonably  good order and  condition.  Any damage  arising
from the acts of Tenant, its agents, employees, contractors or invitees shall be
repaired by Landlord at Tenant's  sole  expense.  Tenant  shall pay  Landlord on
demand the cost of any such repair.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Lease, if Tenant provides written notice (or oral notice in the event of an
emergency,  such as damage to or destruction to or of a structural component, or
any  electrical,  plumbing,  or  mechanical  system of or in the Building or the
Premises (including,  but not limited to, damage to the roof)) to Landlord of an
event or  circumstances  which  requires the action of Landlord  with respect to
repair and/or maintenance, and Landlord fails to commence to perform such action
within a reasonable period of time, given the circumstance, after the receipt of
such notice,  but in any event not later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of
such notice,  and thereafter to diligently  prosecute such action to completion,
then,  Tenant shall send Landlord a second notice  regarding  Tenant's intent to
perform  such  repair  (except  in the event of an  emergency,  in which case no
second  notice  is  required  and  Tenant  may  commence  the  required  repairs
immediately upon Landlord's failure to commence such repairs within a reasonable
period of time given the emergency nature of the repairs),  and if Landlord does
not respond within ten (10) days of receiving this second  notification,  Tenant
shall be entitled to reimbursement by Landlord of Tenant's  reasonable costs and
expenses in making such repair,  plus interest at the Interest Rate specified in
Paragraph 3(d) hereof.  In the event Tenant  undertakes  such repairs,  and such
repairs  will affect the  building  systems or the  structure  of the  Building,
Tenant  shall use only those  


                                      21.

contractors  used by Landlord in the Building for repairs to such systems unless
such  contractors are unwilling or unable to perform,  or timely  perform,  such
repairs,  in which  event  Tenant may use the  services  of any other  qualified
contractor  which  normally and  regularly  performs  similar work in comparable
buildings in the "Multimedia  Gulch" area of the South of Market District of San
Francisco. Further, if Landlord does not deliver a detailed written objection to
Tenant  within  thirty  (30) days  after  receipt of an invoice by Tenant of its
costs of repairs which Tenant  claims should have been made by Landlord,  and if
such invoice from Tenant sets forth a reasonably particularized breakdown of its
costs and expenses in connection  with taking such action on behalf of Landlord,
then it shall be deemed that Landlord agrees with the cost and expenses incurred
by Tenant and shall  thereafter be obligated to reimburse  Tenant for such costs
and expenses,  with interest  thereon at the Interest Rate. If Landlord fails to
so  reimburse  Tenant  therefor,  Tenant  may  bring  an  action  in a court  of
appropriate  jurisdiction to recover such sum from Landlord.  Landlord agrees to
maintain the Real  Property in a manner  comparable to that of other first class
office buildings in the "Multimedia  Gulch" area of the South of Market District
of San Francisco.  Landlord further agrees to have a qualified  engineer who has
knowledge of the Building and can work independent of Tenant's employees on call
twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.

         10.      SERVICES.

                  (a) Subject to the terms of this  Paragraph  10 and subject to
applicable  laws,  regulations  and rules of public  utilities,  Landlord  shall
furnish  to  the  Premises  water,   electrical  power,  gas,  heating  and  air
conditioning,  elevator service and plumbing  services suitable for Tenant's use
of the Premises pursuant to Paragraph 6 hereof, twenty-four hours per day, seven
(7) days per week,  or during  such  other  period as may be  prescribed  by any
applicable  policies or regulations of any utility or governmental  agency;  and
basic  janitorial  service  on  weekdays  (excluding  union  holidays).   Unless
otherwise  specifically provided in this Lease, all means of distribution of all
utilities  within the Premises  shall be supplied by Tenant at its expense,  and
Tenant  shall  pay the cost of  water,  gas,  electricity,  sewerage  and  other
utilities.  Landlord  shall  install,  or cause Tenant to install,  prior to the
Commencement  Date, at Tenant's  expense,  a separate  meter in the Premises for
electricity of a design and type to be reasonably  approved by Landlord.  Tenant
shall  pay the cost of  janitorial  services  to the  Premises  provided  by the
Landlord.  Tenant shall pay the cost of chilled water that Landlord  supplies to
the  Premises  for air  conditioning.  Tenant  shall  pay  such  janitorial  and
utilities costs within fifteen (15) days after delivery of invoices therefor.

         Tenant agrees that at all times it will  cooperate  fully with Landlord
and abide by all  regulations and  requirements  that 


                                      22.

<PAGE>

Landlord may prescribe for the proper functioning and protection of the Building
heating,  ventilating and air conditioning systems. Landlord shall not be liable
for and Tenant shall not be entitled to any  abatement or reduction of Rental by
reason of  Landlord's  failure  to  furnish  any of the  foregoing  or any other
utilities  or  services  when such  failure  is caused  by  accident,  breakage,
repairs,  strikes,  lockouts  or other  labor  disturbances  or  disputes of any
character, by the limitation,  curtailment,  rationing or restrictions on use of
electricity,  gas or any form of  energy,  or by any  other  cause,  similar  or
dissimilar,  beyond the reasonable  control of Landlord.  No such failure and no
interruption of utilities or services from any cause whatsoever shall constitute
an eviction of Tenant,  constructive  or otherwise,  or impose upon Landlord any
liability whatsoever, including, but not limited to, liability for consequential
damages or loss of business by Tenant.  Tenant hereby  waives the  provisions of
California Civil Code Section 1932(1) or any other applicable existing or future
law,  ordinance or  governmental  regulation  permitting the termination of this
Lease due to such failure or  interruption.  Landlord  shall not be liable under
any  circumstances  for  injury  to or  death  of any  person  or  damage  to or
destruction of property,  however  occurring,  through or in connection  with or
incidental  to the  furnishing of or the failure to furnish any of the foregoing
utilities or services or any other  utilities or  services.  Landlord  agrees to
meet with Tenant to attempt to resolve  any issues or  problems  Tenant may have
with the janitorial service or any other services provided to Tenant pursuant to
this Paragraph 10.

                  (b) Landlord makes no  representation  to Tenant regarding the
adequacy or fitness of the heating, air conditioning or ventilation equipment in
the Building to maintain  temperatures  that may be required for, or because of,
any of  Tenant's  equipment  which  uses other  than the  fractional  horsepower
normally required for office equipment, and Landlord shall have no liability for
loss or damage  suffered  by Tenant or others in  connection  therewith.  Tenant
agrees it will not, without the written consent of Landlord,  use any equipment,
apparatus  or  device  in  the  Premises  which  will,  individually  or in  the
aggregate,  in any way  cause  the  amount  of  electricity,  water or  heating,
ventilation  or air  conditioning  supplied to the  Premises to exceed  Tenant's
Percentage  Share of the  design  capacity  of the  Building's  systems.  Tenant
covenants  that at all times its use of electric  current shall never exceed the
capacity of the feeders, risers or electrical installations of the Building. The
costs to repair any damage  Tenant  causes to the base  building  systems due to
Tenant's use of such systems  beyond their design  capacity  shall be payable to
Landlord  within ten (10) days of submission  of a statement  setting forth such
costs.  Landlord shall provide Tenant with information regarding the capacity of
such systems on or before the Commencement Date. Landlord shall not, in any way,
be  liable or  responsible  to Tenant  for any loss or damage or  expense  which
Tenant may incur or sustain if, for any  reasons  beyond  Landlord's  reasonable


                                      23.
<PAGE>

control,  either the quantity or character of electric  service is changed or is
no longer  available or suitable for Tenant's  requirements.  If  submetering of
electricity  in the  Building  will  not  be  permitted  under  future  laws  or
regulations,  the Base Monthly Rental will then be equitably adjusted to include
an additional payment to Landlord reflecting the cost to Landlord for furnishing
electricity to the Premises.

                  (c)      Any amounts which Tenant is required to pay pursuant 
to this Paragraph 10 shall constitute additional rent.

                  (d) In the event that Landlord, at Tenant's request,  provides
services to Tenant that are not otherwise required to be provided in this Lease,
Tenant shall pay  Landlord's  reasonable  charges for such services  (including,
without  limitation,  Landlord's then current  administrative fee therefor) upon
billing therefor provided, prior to providing such service, Landlord delivers to
Tenant a written  estimate  of the cost of such  service  and Tenant  delivers a
written  notice to Landlord  stating  that it agrees to pay for the cost of such
service. Any such request for extra services shall be made not less than one (1)
business day in advance.

                  (e)  In  the   event   any   governmental   authority   having
jurisdiction over the Real Property for the Building  promulgates or revises any
law,  ordinance  or  regulation  or  building,  fire or  other  code or  imposes
mandatory or voluntary  controls or guidelines on Landlord and the Real Property
or the Building  relating to the use or  conservation  of energy or utilities or
the reduction of automobile or other emissions  (collectively  "Controls") or in
the  event  Landlord  is  required  or elects  to make  alterations  to the Real
Property or the  Building in order to comply with such  mandatory  or  voluntary
Controls,  Landlord  may, in its sole  discretion,  comply with such Controls or
make such  alterations  to the Real  Property or the Building  related  thereto;
provided,  however, that Landlord shall only comply with such voluntary controls
if  Comparable  Landlords  are  generally  complying  with such  controls.  Such
compliance and the making of such  alterations  shall not constitute an eviction
of Tenant,  constructive  or  otherwise,  or impose upon  Landlord any liability
whatsoever,  including,  but not limited to, liability for consequential damages
or loss of business by Tenant.

         11.      ACCESS CONTROL.

                  (a) Landlord  shall arrange for a security guard to be on duty
in the lobby of the Building 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Tenant shall
pay the cost of such security guard as additional  rent within fifteen (15) days
after delivery of invoices therefor. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Lease,  Tenant shall have the right to approve of the person  and/or entity
selected  by  Landlord  to provide  security  services  to the  Premises,  which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Landlord shall have the right from
time to time to


                                      24.
<PAGE>

adopt such  policies,  procedures  and  programs as it shall,  in  Landlord's
reasonable  discretion,  deem necessary or  appropriate  for the security of the
Building,  and Tenant shall  cooperate with Landlord in the  enforcement of, and
shall comply with,  the policies,  procedures  and programs  adopted by Landlord
insofar as the same pertain to Tenant,  its agents,  employees,  contractors and
invitees.  Landlord agrees to meet with Tenant to resolve any issues or problems
Tenant may have with the security  services.  Landlord further agrees to consult
with Tenant regarding any changes in security policies,  procedures and programs
that may adversely affect the security of the Premises in Landlord's  reasonable
opinion.

                  (b) In no event shall Landlord be liable for damages resulting
from any  error  with  regard  to the  admission  to or the  exclusion  from the
Building of any person. In the case of invasion, mob, riot, public demonstration
or other  circumstances  rendering such action advisable in Landlord's  opinion,
Landlord  reserves  the right to  prevent  access  to the  Building  during  the
continuance  of the  same by such  action  as  Landlord  may  deem  appropriate,
including closing doors.

                  (c) In the event of any  picketing,  public  demonstration  or
other threat to the security of the Building and to the extent  attributable  to
Tenant,  Tenant shall  reimburse  Landlord for any actual and  reasonable  costs
incurred by Landlord in connection with such picketing,  demonstration  or other
threat in order to protect  the  security  of the  Building,  and  Tenant  shall
indemnify  and hold  Landlord  harmless  from and  protect  and defend  Landlord
against  any and all  claims,  demands,  suits,  liability,  damage  or loss and
against all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in
connection  therewith,  arising  out  of or  relating  to  any  such  picketing,
demonstration  or other  threat to the extent  attributable  to  Tenant.  Tenant
agrees  not to  employ  any  person,  entity or  contractor  for any work in the
Premises  (including moving Tenant's equipment and furnishings in, out or around
the Premises)  whose  presence may give rise to a labor or other  disturbance in
the Building  and, if necessary  to prevent such a  disturbance  in a particular
situation, Landlord may require Tenant to employ union labor for the work.

         12.      ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.

                  (a)  Restriction  on  Transfers.   Tenant  shall  not,  either
voluntarily  or by operation  of law,  (i) assign or transfer  this Lease or any
interest herein,  (ii) sublet the Premises,  or any part thereof, or (iii) enter
into a license  agreement  or other  arrangement  whereby the  Premises,  or any
portion  thereof,  are held or utilized by another  party (each of the foregoing
defined  herein as a "Transfer"),  without the express prior written  consent of
Landlord,  which consent Landlord shall not unreasonably  withhold. Any such act
(whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise) 

                                      25.


without the consent of Landlord  pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph 12
shall, at Landlord's  option,  be void and/or constitute an Event of Default (as
defined in  Paragraph  18(a)) under this Lease.  Consent to any  Transfer  shall
neither relieve Tenant of the necessity of obtaining  Landlord's  consent to any
future Transfer nor relieve Tenant from any liability under this Lease.

         By way of example and without limitation, the failure to satisfy any of
the following  conditions or standards shall be deemed to constitute  sufficient
grounds for Landlord to refuse to grant its consent to the proposed Transfer.

                  (1) The proposed  Transferee must expressly  assume all of the
         provisions,  covenants  and  conditions  of this  Lease  on the part of
         Tenant  to be kept and  performed  as such  provisions,  covenants  and
         condition  relate to that portion of the Premises to be occupied by the
         proposed Transferee.

                  (2) The  proposed  Transferee  must  satisfy  Landlord's  then
         current credit and other standards for tenants of the Building  (taking
         into account Tenant's continuing  liability under this Lease and taking
         into  account  whether or not Tenant is  continuing  in  occupancy of a
         material  portion  of  the  Premises)  and,  in  Landlord's  reasonable
         opinion,  have the  financial  strength and stability to perform all of
         the  obligations  of the Tenant  under this Lease (as they apply to the
         transferred space) as and when they fall due.

                  (3) The proposed Transferee must be reasonably satisfactory to
Landlord as to business reputation.

                  (4)  The   proposed  use  of  the  Premises  by  the  proposed
         Transferee must be, in Landlord's  reasonable opinion:  (a) lawful; (b)
         appropriate  to the location and  configuration  of the  Premises;  (c)
         unlikely  to  cause a  material  increase  in  insurance  premiums  for
         insurance  policies  applicable  to the  Building;  (d)  absent any new
         tenant  improvements  that  Landlord  would be entitled  to  disapprove
         pursuant to Paragraph 8 hereof;  (e) unlikely to create any  materially
         increased burden in the operation of the Building,  or in the operation
         of any of its facilities or equipment,  unless Tenant agrees to pay the
         increased  cost  therefor;  and (f)  unlikely  to impair  the  dignity,
         reputation or character of the Building.

                  (5) The proposed  use of the  Premises  must not result in the
         division  of any full  floor of the  Premises  into more than three (3)
         separate  leased  premises or tenant spaces,  and Tenant must tender to
         Landlord as an  additional  security  deposit the  estimated  amount to
         restore the Premises to no more than two (2) separate  leased  premises
         or tenant spaces if the proposed division constitutes three (3) or more
         such spaces.


                                      26.

<PAGE>


                  (6) At the time of the proposed Transfer,  an Event of Default
         (as defined in Paragraph  18(a)  below) shall not have  occurred and be
         continuing,  and no event  may have  occurred  that  with  notice,  the
         passage of time, or both, would become a material Event of Default.

                  (7) The proposed Transferee shall not be a governmental entity
         or other entity that holds any exemption from the payment of ad valorem
         or other taxes which would prohibit  Landlord from collecting from such
         Transferee any amounts otherwise payable under this Lease.

                  (8) The proposed Transferee shall not be a then present tenant
         or affiliate  or  subsidiary  of a then present  tenant in the Building
         unless there is no other suitable space available in the Building.

                  (9) Landlord shall not be negotiating with, and shall not have
         at any time  within the past  thirty  (30) days  negotiated  with,  the
         proposed Transferee for space in the Building (unless Landlord,  in its
         reasonable  judgment,  believes  that it is  unlikely  that any further
         discussions  between Tenant and such proposed Transferee will lead to a
         lease transaction).

                  (b)  Landlord's  Termination  Right.  Except in the event of a
Permitted  Transfer (as defined  below),  Landlord  shall have no  obligation to
consent or consider  granting its consent to any proposed Transfer unless Tenant
has first delivered to Landlord a written notice regarding such Transfer,  which
notice  shall  include the base rent and other  economic  terms of the  proposed
Transfer,  the date upon which Tenant desires to effect such Transfer and all of
the other material terms of the proposed Transfer ("Tenant's  Offer").  Landlord
shall have the right, by notice to Tenant within fifteen (15) days after receipt
of Tenant's  Offer,  to  terminate  this Lease (or, in the case of a sublease of
less than the entire  Premises,  terminate  this Lease as to the  portion of the
Premises to be sublet),  which  termination shall be effective as of the date on
which the intended  assignment or sublease would have been effective if Landlord
had not exercised such  termination  right. If Landlord elects to terminate this
Lease in whole or in part,  as the case may be,  then from and after the date of
such termination,  Landlord and Tenant each shall have no further  obligation to
the other  under this Lease with  respect  to the  Premises  (or the  applicable
portion thereof) except for matters  occurring or obligations  arising hereunder
prior to the date of such termination.  If Landlord does not respond to Tenant's
Offer within such fifteen (15) day period,  Tenant may enter into such  Transfer
with any bona fide independent  third-party  Transferee (as defined in Paragraph
12(c)  below)  within one hundred  eighty  (180) days of the end of such fifteen
(15) day period, so long as such Transfer is for the same base rent set forth in
Tenant's  Offer and such Transfer  otherwise  contains  terms not more than 


                                      27.
<PAGE>

five percent (5%) more favorable  economically  to the Transferee than the terms
stated in Tenant's  Offer,  taking into  account  all rent  concessions,  tenant
improvements, and any other terms which have an economic impact on the Transfer;
provided, however, that the prior written approval of Landlord for such Transfer
must be obtained, and the other provisions of this Paragraph 12 must be complied
with, all in accordance  with this Paragraph 12.  Landlord's  foregoing right of
termination   shall   continue   throughout  the  entire  term  of  this  Lease.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Landlord shall only have the right to terminate
the Lease (in whole or as to the portion of the  Premises  to be sublet,  as the
case may be) pursuant to this  Paragraph  12(b) if the proposed  Transfer is for
one entire floor or more of the Premises  and for at least  ninety-five  percent
(95%) of the remaining term of the Lease.

                  (c)  Landlord's  Approval  Process.  Except  in the event of a
Permitted Transfer,  Tenant shall, in each instance of a proposed Transfer, give
written notice to Landlord at least  forty-five (45) days prior to the effective
date of any proposed  Transfer,  specifying in such notice (i) the nature of the
proposed Transfer, (ii) the portion of the Premises to be transferred, (iii) the
intended  use of the  transferred  Premises,  (iv)  all  economic  terms  of the
proposed  Transfer,  (v) the effective  date  thereof,  (vi) the identity of the
transferee  under  the  proposed  Transfer  (the  "Transferee"),  (vii)  current
financial statements of the Transferee, and (viii) a description of the business
of the Transferee (collectively,  "Tenant's Notice"). Tenant shall also promptly
furnish  Landlord with any other  information  reasonably  requested by Landlord
relating to the proposed Transfer or the proposed Transferee. Within twenty (20)
days  after  receipt  by  Landlord  of  Tenant's   Notice  (and  any  additional
information and data  reasonably  requested by Landlord within five (5) business
days of such  notice),  Landlord  shall notify  Tenant of its  determination  to
either (i) consent to the proposed  Transfer,  or (ii) refuse to consent to such
proposed  Transfer.  If Landlord does not respond to Tenant's Notice within such
twenty (20) day period,  Tenant shall  deliver to Landlord a second  notice.  If
Landlord does not approve or reasonably  disapprove the proposed Transfer within
five (5) days after receipt of such second  notice,  Landlord shall be deemed to
have consented to the proposed Transfer.

                  (d)  Consideration  for  Transfer.  Except  in the  event of a
Permitted Transfer, fifty percent (50%) of all (i) consideration paid or payable
by Transferee to Tenant as consideration  for any such Transfer,  and (ii) rents
received in connection  with the Transfer by Tenant from Transferee in excess of
the sum of the Rental payable by Tenant to Landlord  under this Lease,  plus the
value of any  Alterations  or any special  improvements  made to the Premises by
Tenant for such proposed  Transferee  (not to exceed the  improvement  allowance
that would be provided to a comparable tenant by Comparable Landlords), plus any
brokerage  commissions  (not to  exceed  prevailing  market  rates),  reasonable
attorneys' fees and other professional fees

                                      28.
<PAGE>


in connection  with the proposed  Transfer,  shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord
immediately  upon receipt thereof by Tenant.  If there is more than one sublease
under this Lease, the amounts (if any) to be paid by Tenant to Landlord pursuant
to the preceding  sentence shall be separately  calculated for each sublease and
amounts due Landlord  with regard to any one sublease may not be offset  against
rental and other  consideration  pertaining to or due under any other  sublease.
Upon  Landlord's  request  and after an Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing,  Tenant shall assign to Landlord all amounts to be paid to Tenant by
any  Transferee  and shall direct such  Transferee  to pay the same  directly to
Landlord.

                  If this Lease is assigned,  whether or not in violation of the
terms of this  Lease,  Landlord  may  collect  rent  from the  assignee.  If the
Premises or any part thereof is sublet, Landlord shall, upon an Event of Default
by Tenant hereunder,  collect rent from the subtenant. In either event, Landlord
may apply the amount  collected  from the  assignee  or  subtenant  to  Tenant's
monetary  obligations  hereunder.  Neither Landlord's  collection of rent from a
Transferee nor any course of dealing between  Landlord and any Transferee  shall
constitute or be deemed to constitute Landlord's consent to any Transfer.

                  (e)  Permitted  Transfers.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the
contrary in this Lease,  Tenant may,  without  Landlord's prior written consent,
sublet  any or all of the  Premises  or  assign  the  Lease  on such  terms  and
conditions  as Tenant may elect to: (i) a  subsidiary  or  corporation  or other
entity  controlling,  controlled by or under common control with Tenant;  (ii) a
successor corporation related to Tenant by merger, consolidation,  nonbankruptcy
reorganization,  or government action; or (iii) a purchaser of substantially all
of  Tenant's  assets  ((i),  (ii) and  (iii)  above  shall be  referred  to as a
"Permitted  Transfer"),  provided Landlord receives not less than ten (10) days'
prior written notice of such transfer.  For the purpose of this Lease,  any sale
or transfer of Tenant's  capital  stock,  through any national  market system or
public  exchange,  shall not be deemed an assignment,  subletting,  or any other
transfer of the Lease or the Premises.

                  (f) Documentation.  Tenant agrees that any instrument by which
Tenant  assigns  this Lease or any  interest  therein  or  sublets or  otherwise
Transfers all or any portion of the Premises  shall  expressly  provide that the
Transferee may not further  assign this Lease or any interest  therein or sublet
the sublet space without  Landlord's  prior written consent (which consent shall
be subject to the provisions of this Paragraph 12), and that the Transferee will
comply with all of the  provisions  of this Lease and that  Landlord may enforce
the Lease provisions directly against such Transferee.  No permitted  subletting
by Tenant  shall be  effective  until  there has been  delivered  to  Landlord a
counterpart  of the  sublease  in which the  subtenant  agrees to be and  remain
jointly and severally  liable 


                                      29.

with Tenant for the payment of rent  pertaining  to the sublet space and for the
performance of all of the terms and  provisions of this Lease  pertaining to the
sublet space; provided,  however, that the subtenant shall be liable to Landlord
for rent only in the amount set forth in the sublease.  No permitted  assignment
shall be  effective  unless and until  there has been  delivered  to  Landlord a
counterpart  of the  assignment  in which the  assignee  assumes all of Tenant's
obligations under this Lease arising on or after the date of the assignment. The
failure or refusal of a subtenant  or  assignee  to execute any such  instrument
shall not release or discharge  the  subtenant or assignee from its liability as
set forth above.

                  (g) Options Personal to Original  Tenant.  Except in the event
of a Permitted  Transfer,  if Landlord consents to a Transfer hereunder and this
Lease contains any renewal options,  expansion options, rights of first refusal,
rights  of first  negotiation  or any  other  rights or  options  pertaining  to
additional  space in the Building,  such rights and/or  options shall not run to
the  Transferee,  it being agreed by the parties hereto that any such rights and
options are personal to the original  Tenant named herein and any  transferee in
the event of a Permitted Transfer and may not be transferred.

                  (h)  Encumbrance  of Lease.  Notwithstanding  any provision of
this Lease to the contrary,  Tenant shall not mortgage,  encumber or hypothecate
this Lease or any interest herein without the prior written consent of Landlord,
which consent may be withheld in Landlord's  sole and absolute  discretion.  Any
such act without the prior  written  consent of Landlord  (whether  voluntary or
involuntary,  by operation of law or otherwise) shall, at Landlord's  option, be
void and/or constitute an Event of Default under this Lease.

                  (i) No Merger.  The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease
or of the  Premises by Tenant or a mutual  cancellation  of this Lease shall not
work a merger,  and at the option of  Landlord  any  existing  subleases  may be
terminated or be deemed assigned to Landlord in which latter event the subleases
or subtenants shall become tenants of Landlord.

                  (j)  Landlord's  Costs.  Except  in the  event of a  Permitted
Transfer,  Tenant  shall  pay to  Landlord  the  amount  of  Landlord's  cost of
processing each proposed Transfer (including, without limitation, attorneys' and
other professional fees, and the cost of Landlord's  administrative,  accounting
and  clerical  time;  collectively  "Processing  Costs")  not to  exceed  in the
aggregate three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per Transfer, and the amount of all
direct and indirect  expenses  incurred by Landlord arising from the assignee or
sublessee taking occupancy of the subject space (including,  without limitation,
costs of  freight  elevator  operation  for  moving  of  furnishings  and  trade
fixtures, security service, janitorial and cleaning service, and rubbish removal
service).

         13. WAIVER;  INDEMNIFICATION.  Neither Landlord nor Landlord's  agents,
nor any shareholder, constituent partner or other owner of Landlord or any agent
of Landlord,  nor any contractor,  officer,  director or employee of any thereof
shall be liable to Tenant and Tenant waives all claims against Landlord and such
other  persons for any injury to or death of any person or for loss of use of or
damage to or destruction of property in or about the Premises,  the Storage Area
or the Building by or from any cause whatsoever,  including without  limitation,
earthquake or earth movement,  gas, fire,  oil,  electricity or leakage from the
roof, walls, basement or other portion of the Premises,  the Storage Area or the
Building,  except  to the  extent  caused  by the gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct  of  Landlord,  Landlord's  agents,  the  shareholders,   constituent
partners  and/or  other  owners of  Landlord or any agent of  Landlord,  and all
contractors,  officers,  directors and  employees of any thereof  (collectively,
"Indemnitees").  Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold the Indemnitees and each of
them,  harmless from and to protect and defend each  Indemnitee  against any and
all claims, demands, suits, liability,  damage or loss and against all costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection therewith,
(a) arising out of any injury or death of any person or damage to or destruction
of property occurring in, on or about the Premises or the Storage Area, from any
cause whatsoever, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such  Indemnitee,  or (b) occurring in, on or about any facilities
(including without limitation elevators, stairways, passageways or hallways) the
use of which Tenant has in common with other  tenants,  or elsewhere in or about
the  Building  or in the  vicinity  of the  Building,  to the extent such claim,
injury or damage is caused by the act, neglect, default, or omission of any duty
by Tenant, its former or current agents,  contractors,  employees,  invitees, or
subtenants  or other  persons  in or about the  Building  by reason of  Tenant's
occupancy of the Premises, or otherwise by any conduct of any of said persons in
or about the  Premises,  the Storage Area or the Real  Property,  or (c) arising
from any  failure  of  Tenant  to  observe  or  perform  any of its  obligations
hereunder. If any action or proceeding is brought against any of the Indemnitees
by reason of any such claim or  liability,  Tenant,  upon notice from  Landlord,
covenants  to  resist  and  defend  at  Tenant's  sole  expense  such  action or
proceeding by counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to Landlord.  The provisions of
this Paragraph  shall survive the  termination of this Lease with respect to any
claims  or  liability  occurring  prior  to  such  termination.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Lease,  Landlord shall not be indemnified  for,
and shall indemnify,  defend, protect and hold harmless Tenant from, all losses,
damages, liabilities,  judgments, actions, claims, attorneys' fees, consultants'
fees,  payments,  costs  and  expenses  to the  extent  arising  from the  gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnitees.

         14.      INSURANCE.

                  (a) At  Tenant's  expense,  Tenant  shall  procure,  carry and
maintain in effect  throughout the term of this Lease,  in a form  acceptable to
Landlord and with such insurance  companies as are acceptable to Landlord (which
companies shall have a Best's rating of A-X or better),  the following insurance
coverage:

                           (i)      Commercial general liability insurance, on 
an occurrence basis, with limits in an amount not less than  $5,000,000 combined
single  limit per  occurrence,  for claims or losses arising out of or resulting
from personal  injury  (including  bodily  injury), death and/or property damage
sustained or alleged to have been sustained by any person for any reason on the 
Premises or in the  Storage  Area,  for  liability arising out of or resulting 
from Tenant's  covenant in Paragraph 13 to indemnify Landlord  and  all  other  
Indemnities,   its  agents  and  employees,  and  for contractual liability;

                           (ii)  All Risk  Replacement  Cost  insurance  with an
agreed amount endorsement upon property of every
description  and kind  owned by  Tenant  and  located  in the  Premises  and for
Tenant's Extra  Improvements  and  Alterations in an amount equal to 100% of the
full replacement value thereof; and

                           (iii) Workers' compensation  insurance, in accordance
with applicable law.

                  (b) Not more  often  than  every  year and upon not less  than
sixty (60) days' prior written notice,  Landlord, in its reasonable  discretion,
may require  Tenant to increase  the  insurance  limits set forth in  Paragraphs
14(a)(i)  and  14(a)(ii)  above to  amounts  not in excess of  insurance  limits
generally required by Comparable Landlords for comparable tenancies.

                  (c) All policies of liability insurance described in Paragraph
14(a)(i) of this Lease so obtained and  maintained  shall be carried in the name
of  Tenant,  name  Landlord  and  Landlord's  designated  agents  as  additional
insureds,  and shall provide that the  insurance  policy so endorsed will be the
primary insurance providing coverage for Landlord, and contain a cross-liability
endorsement  stating that the rights of insureds  shall not be prejudiced by one
insured  making a claim or commencing an action  against  another  insured.  Any
other   liability   insurance   maintained  by  Landlord  shall  be  excess  and
non-contributing.  At Landlord's election,  such policies described in Paragraph
14(a)(i) shall name the holder of any Superior  Interest or any other interested
party as an insured party under a standard mortgagee endorsement.

                  (d) All  insurance  policies  required  under this Lease shall
provide that the insurer shall not cancel,  reduce, modify or fail to renew such
coverage  without  thirty (30) days' prior  written  notice to Landlord.  Tenant
shall  deliver  certificates  


                                      32.

<PAGE>

of all insurance  required  hereunder upon the  commencement of the term of this
Lease.  In the  event  Tenant  does not  comply  with the  requirements  of this
Paragraph 14, Landlord may, at its option and at Tenant's expense, purchase such
insurance coverage to protect Landlord. The cost of such insurance shall be paid
to Landlord by Tenant,  as additional  rent,  immediately  upon demand therefor,
together with interest at the Interest Rate until paid.

                  (e)  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary in this Lease,
the parties release each other, and their respective authorized representatives,
agents,  employees,  successors,  assignees and subtenants,  from any claims for
loss or damage  that are  caused  by or result  from  perils  insured  under any
insurance  policies  carried  by the  parties  in  force at the time of any such
damage which is required to be insured  against under this Lease, or which would
normally  be covered by the  standard  form of "all  risk"  casualty  insurance,
without  regard  to the  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  of the  entity  so
released. Each party shall cause each insurance policy obtained by it to provide
that the  insurer  waives all right of recovery  by way of  subrogation  against
either  party in  connection  with any loss or  damage  covered  by the  policy.
Neither party shall be liable to the other for any loss or damage covered by the
insured risks under any insurance policy  maintained by either party or required
by this Lease.

         15.      PROTECTION OF LENDERS.

                  (a) This Lease shall be subject and  subordinate  at all times
to all ground or underlying  leases which may now or hereafter  exist  affecting
the  Building or the Land,  or both,  and to the lien of any mortgage or deed of
trust in any amount or amounts  whatsoever now or hereafter placed on or against
the  Building  or the Land,  or both,  or on or against  Landlord's  interest or
estate  therein  (such  mortgages,  deeds of trust and  leases are  referred  to
herein, collectively, as "Superior Interests"), all without the necessity of any
further  instrument  executed or  delivered  by or on the part of Tenant for the
purpose of  effectuating  such  subordination.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
Tenant  covenants and agrees to execute and deliver,  upon demand,  such further
reasonable  instruments  evidencing such subordination of this Lease to any such
Superior  Interest as may be required  by Landlord  provided  the Holder of such
Superior  Interest agrees in writing (i) that this Lease shall not be terminated
so long as an Event of Default has not occurred and is not  continuing  and (ii)
to recognize  all of Tenant's  rights,  interests  and options under this Lease.
Landlord shall make reasonable  efforts to provide Tenant with a non-disturbance
agreement  executed by the holder of any such  Superior  Interest on or prior to
the Commencement Date.

                  (b)  Notwithstanding   the  foregoing,   in  the  event  of  a
foreclosure  of any such  mortgage  or deed of trust or of any  


                                      33.

<PAGE>

other  action  or  proceeding  for  the  enforcement  thereof,  or of  any  sale
thereunder,  this Lease shall not be terminated or  extinguished,  nor shall the
rights and possession of Tenant  hereunder be disturbed,  if no Event of Default
then exists under this Lease, and Tenant shall attorn to the person who acquires
Landlord's interest hereunder through any such mortgage or deed of trust.

                  (c)  Within ten (10) days after  Landlord's  written  request,
Tenant shall deliver to Landlord,  or to any actual or  prospective  holder of a
Superior Interest ("Holder") that Landlord  designates,  such publicly available
financial  statements  as are  reasonably  required by such Holder to verify the
financial  condition  of Tenant (or any  assignee,  subtenant  or  guarantor  of
Tenant).  Tenant  represents  and warrants to Landlord and such Holder that each
financial  statement  delivered  by Tenant  shall be  accurate  in all  material
respects as of the date of such  statement.  All financial  statements  shall be
confidential and used only for the purposes stated herein.

                  (d) If Landlord is in default,  Tenant will accept cure of any
default by any Holder whose name and address shall have been furnished to Tenant
in  writing.  Tenant may not  exercise  any rights or  remedies  for  Landlord's
default  unless Tenant gives notice  thereof to each such Holder and the default
is not cured within  thirty (30) days  thereafter or such greater time as may be
reasonably  necessary to cure such default. A default which cannot reasonably be
cured within said 30-day period shall be deemed cured within said period if work
necessary  to cure the  default  is  commenced  within  such  time and  proceeds
diligently thereafter until the default is cured.

                  (e) If any prospective  Holder should require,  as a condition
of any Superior Interest, a modification of the provisions of this Lease, Tenant
shall  approve  and  execute  any such  modifications  promptly  after  request,
provided no such  modification  shall  relate to the Rental  payable  hereunder,
Tenant's  parking  rights  hereunder,  the length of the term hereof or Tenant's
Option to  Extend  such  term,  or  otherwise  materially  alter  the  rights or
obligations of Landlord or Tenant hereunder.

         16.      ENTRY BY LANDLORD.

                  (a)  Landlord  reserves,  and  shall at all times  have,  upon
reasonable  written  notice to Tenant of not less than  twenty-four  (24)  hours
(except no notice shall be required in the event of an emergency),  the right to
enter the Premises to inspect them; to supply  janitorial  service and any other
service  to be  provided  by  Landlord  hereunder;  to submit  the  Premises  to
prospective  purchasers or mortgagees at any time, or to prospective  tenants in
the  last  twelve  (12)   months  of  the  Lease  term;   to  post   notices  of
nonresponsibility;  and to alter, improve or repair the Premises and any portion
of the  Building as permitted or provided  hereunder,  all without  abatement of


                                      34.

<PAGE>


Rental;  and may erect scaffolding and other necessary  structures in or through
the  Premises  where  reasonably  required  by the  character  of the work to be
performed;  provided,  however,  that  any  such  entrance  or  work  shall  not
unreasonably  interfere with Tenant's use of or access to the Premises.  If such
entry is made as  aforesaid,  Tenant hereby waives any claim for damages for any
injury or inconvenience to or interference with Tenant's  business,  any loss of
occupancy or quiet  enjoyment of the Premises,  and any other loss occasioned by
such entry. For each of the foregoing purposes, Landlord shall at all times have
and  retain a key and/or  other  access  device  with which to unlock all of the
doors in,  on and  about the  Premises  (excluding  Tenant's  vaults,  safes and
similar areas designated in writing by Tenant in advance and approved reasonably
by Landlord);  and Landlord  shall have the right to use any and all means which
Landlord  may deem proper to open said doors in an  emergency in order to obtain
entry to the Premises, and any entry to the Premises obtained by Landlord by any
of said means, or otherwise,  shall not under any  circumstances be construed or
deemed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into or a detainer of the Premises, or
any portion thereof.

                  (b)  Landlord  shall also have the right at any time to change
the arrangement or location of entrances or passageways, doors and doorways, and
corridors, elevators, stairs, toilets or other public parts of the Building, and
to change the name,  number or  designation  by which the  Building  is commonly
known,  and none of the  foregoing  shall be deemed  an  actual or  constructive
eviction  of Tenant,  nor shall it  entitle  Tenant to any  reduction  of Rental
hereunder  or result in any  liability  of  Landlord to Tenant.  Landlord  shall
consult with Tenant to minimize any security risks to Tenant resulting from such
changes. Notwithstanding the foregoing changes, Tenant shall at all times during
the term of this Lease continue to have reasonable access to the Premises.

         17.      [Intentionally Omitted]

         18.      DEFAULT AND REMEDIES.

                  (a) The occurrence of any one or more of the following  events
(each an "Event of Default") shall constitute a breach of this Lease by Tenant:

                           (i)     Tenant fails to pay any Basic Monthly Rental,
Monthly Storage Rental or additional monthly rent under  Paragraph  4(b) hereof 
as and when such rent  becomes due and payable and such failure continues for 
more than five (5) business days after Landlord gives written notice thereof to 
Tenant; provided,  however, that after the second such failure in a calendar  
year,  only the  passage of time,  but no further  notice (except any notice 
required by statute), shall be required to establish an Event of Default in the 
same calendar year; or

                                      35.

<PAGE>


                           (ii) Tenant fails to pay any additional rent or other
amount of money or charge payable by Tenant
hereunder as and when such  additional  rent or amount or charge becomes due and
payable and such failure continues for more than twenty (20) days after Landlord
gives written notice thereof to Tenant; provided, however, that after the second
such failure in a calendar year, only the passage of time, but no further notice
(except any notice required by statute), shall be required to establish an Event
of Default in the same calendar year; or

                           (iii)  Tenant  fails to perform or breaches any other
agreement or covenant of this Lease to be performed or
observed by Tenant as and when performance or observance is due and such failure
or breach  continues for more than twenty (20) days after Landlord gives written
notice  thereof to  Tenant;  provided,  however,  that if, by the nature of such
agreement or covenant,  such failure or breach cannot reasonably be cured within
such period of twenty (20) days,  an Event of Default shall not exist as long as
Tenant  commences  with due diligence and dispatch the curing of such failure or
breach  within  such  period of  twenty  (20)  days  and,  having so  commenced,
thereafter  prosecutes  with  diligence and dispatch and completes the curing of
such failure or breach within a reasonable time; or

                           (iv) Tenant (A) is generally  not paying its debts as
they become due, (B) files, or consents by answer or
otherwise to the filing  against it of, a petition for relief or  reorganization
or arrangement or any other petition in bankruptcy or for liquidation or to take
advantage of any  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or other  debtors'  relief law of any
jurisdiction,  (C) makes an  assignment  for the benefit of its  creditors,  (D)
consents to the appointment of a custodian,  receiver,  trustee or other officer
with similar powers of Tenant or of any substantial  part of Tenant's  property,
or (E) takes action for the purpose of any of the foregoing; or

                           (v) Without consent by Tenant,  a court or government
authority enters an order, and such order is not
vacated within thirty (30) days, (A) appointing a custodian,  receiver,  trustee
or other  officer with similar  powers with respect to Tenant or with respect to
any  substantial  part of Tenant's  property,  or (B)  constituting an order for
relief or approving a petition for relief or  reorganization  or  arrangement or
any other petition in bankruptcy or for  liquidation or to take advantage of any
bankruptcy,  insolvency or other debtors' relief law of any jurisdiction, or (C)
ordering the dissolution, winding-up or liquidation of Tenant; or

                           (vi) This Lease or any estate of Tenant  hereunder is
levied upon under any attachment or execution and such attachment or execution 
is not vacated within thirty (30) days; or

                                      36.
<PAGE>

                           (vii)  Tenant  abandons the Premises and fails to pay
the Rental due.

                  (b) If an Event of  Default  occurs,  Landlord  shall have the
right at any time to give a written  termination  notice to Tenant  and,  on the
date specified in such notice,  Tenant's right to possession shall terminate and
this Lease shall terminate. Upon such termination, Landlord shall have the right
to recover from Tenant:

                           (i)      The worth at the time of award of all unpaid
rent which had been earned at the time of termination;

                           (ii) The worth at the time of award of the  amount by
which all unpaid rent which would have been earned
after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss
that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided;

                           (iii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by
which all unpaid rent for the balance of the term of
this Lease  after the time of award  exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; and

                           (iv)  All  other  amounts   necessary  to  compensate
Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by
Tenant's  failure to perform  all of  Tenant's  obligations  under this Lease or
which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.

The "worth at the time of award" of the  amounts  referred to in clauses (i) and
(ii) above shall be computed by allowing interest at the maximum annual interest
rate allowed by law for business  loans (not  primarily for personal,  family or
household purposes) not exempt from the usury law at the time of termination or,
if  there is no such  maximum  annual  interest  rate,  at the rate of  eighteen
percent (18%) per annum. The "worth at the time of award" of the amount referred
to in clause  (iii) above shall be  computed by  discounting  such amount at the
discount rate of the Federal  Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award
plus one percent (1%). For the purpose of determining  unpaid rent under clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) above, the rent reserved in this Lease shall be deemed to be
the total rent payable by Tenant under Articles 3 and 4 hereof.

                  (c) Even though  Tenant has  breached  this Lease,  this Lease
shall  continue in effect for so long as Landlord  does not  terminate  Tenant's
right to  possession,  and Landlord  shall have all of its rights and  remedies,
including  the right,  pursuant to  California  Civil Code  Section  1951.4,  to
recover  all rent as it becomes  due under this Lease.  Acts of  maintenance  or
preservation  or efforts to relet the Premises or the  appointment of a receiver
upon  initiative  of Landlord to protect  Landlord's  interest  under this Lease
shall not  constitute  a  termination  of 


                                      37.
<PAGE>

Tenant's  right to possession  unless  written notice of termination is given by
Landlord to Tenant.

                  (d) The remedies provided for in this Lease are in addition to
all other  remedies  available  to  Landlord  at law or in equity by  statute or
otherwise.

         19.      DAMAGE BY FIRE OR OTHER CASUALTY.

                  (a)  If  the  Premises   (including   all  Building   Standard
Improvements)  are  partially  destroyed  or damaged by fire or other  casualty,
Landlord  shall,  subject to  Paragraphs  19(b),  19(c),  19(d) and 19(e) below,
promptly repair such damage if, in Landlord's reasonable judgment based upon the
written  determination of a California licensed  contractor,  such repair can be
completed within one hundred eighty (180) days under the laws and regulations of
the state, federal,  county and municipal  authorities having jurisdiction,  and
this Lease shall remain in full force and effect,  provided  that if there shall
be damage to the Premises  from any such cause and such damage is not the result
of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant, its agents,  employees,
contractors  or invitees,  Tenant shall be entitled to a reduction of the Rental
(the provisions of Paragraph 3(a) hereof  notwithstanding)  while such repair is
being made in the proportion that the area of the Premises rendered untenantable
by such  damage  bears to the total area of the  Premises.  Tenant's  right to a
reduction  of Rental under this  Paragraph  19 shall be Tenant's  sole remedy in
connection with any such damage.

                  (b) If such repairs cannot, in Landlord's  reasonable judgment
based upon the written  determination of a California  licensed  contractor,  be
completed  within one hundred eighty (180) days, or if such damage occurs during
the last six (6)  months  of the term of this  Lease,  Landlord  shall  have the
option either (i) to repair such damage, this Lease continuing in full force and
effect, but with the Rental  proportionately  reduced (subject to the conditions
set forth in  Paragraph  19(a)  above),  or (ii) to give notice to Tenant at any
time within  thirty (30) days after the  occurrence  of such damage  terminating
this Lease as of a date  specified in such notice,  which shall not be less than
thirty  (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after the giving of such  notice.  If
such notice of termination is so given,  the Lease and all interest of Tenant in
the  Premises  shall  terminate on the date  specified  in such notice,  and the
Rental reduced (subject to the conditions set forth in Paragraph 19(a) above) in
proportion  to the area of the  Premises  rendered  untenantable  by the damage,
shall be paid up to the date of such  termination,  Landlord  hereby agreeing to
refund to Tenant any Rental  theretofore  paid for any period of time subsequent
to the termination date.

                  (c) If the  Building  is damaged by fire or other  casualty to
the extent that the repair cost would exceed thirty-

                                      38.

three  percent  (33%)  or  more  of  its  replacement  value,  or if  more  than
thirty-three  percent  (33%) of the rentable area of the Building is affected by
fire or other  casualty  and  repairs  to the  Building  cannot,  in  Landlord's
reasonable judgment based upon the advice of a licensed contractor, be completed
within one hundred  eighty (180) days,  or if insurance  proceeds  sufficient to
complete the repairs are not  available due to exercise of rights of a Holder to
collect  such  proceeds,  then in any such case,  whether  the  Premises  or the
Storage Area are damaged or not,  Landlord shall have the right,  at its option,
to be  reasonably  exercised,  to terminate  this Lease by giving  Tenant notice
thereof  within  thirty  (30)  days  of such  casualty  specifying  the  date of
termination  which  shall not be less than  thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60)
days  after the  giving of such  notice,  and to the  extent  the  Premises  are
damaged,  Tenant  shall be entitled to  reduction  of the Rental as set forth in
Paragraph 19(a) above.

                  (d) If the Premises are damaged by fire or other  casualty not
resulting in whole or in part from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Tenant or its employees, agents, contractors or subtenants and the repair to the
Premises  cannot,  in  Landlord's  reasonable  judgment  (based upon the written
determination  of a California  licensed  contractor),  be completed  within one
hundred  eighty (180) days,  assuming the  availability  of labor and materials,
Tenant, at its option, may terminate this Lease.  Tenant's notice to Landlord of
its election to terminate the Lease must be delivered to Landlord  within thirty
(30) days of the date of  Landlord's  notice of the  estimated  time to complete
repairs in accordance with this Paragraph 19, and the termination shall be as of
a date specified in such Tenant's notice which shall be no less than thirty (30)
nor more than sixty (60) days after the giving of such notice. In the event of a
termination of the Lease by Tenant under this Paragraph  19(d), the Rental shall
be reduced in the same manner as provided under Paragraph 19(b) above,  provided
Tenant does not elect to terminate this Lease as permitted in this Paragraph 19.

                  (e) If the Storage  Area is damaged by fire or other  casualty
not resulting in whole or in part from the  negligence or willful  misconduct of
Tenant or its employees, agents, contractors or subtenants and the repair to the
Storage Area cannot,  in Landlord's  judgment,  be completed  within thirty (30)
days,  assuming  the  availability  of labor and  materials,  this  Lease  shall
terminate as to the Storage Area only.

                  (f)  Notwithstanding  any of the  provisions  of  this  Lease,
Landlord shall in no event be required to repair any injury or damage by fire or
other  cause  whatsoever  to, or to make any  repairs  or  replacements  of, any
panelings,  decorations,  partitions, railings, ceilings, floor coverings, trade
or office fixtures or any other property of, or improvements (including Tenant's
Extra  Improvements  and any  Alterations)  installed  on 


                                      39.

<PAGE>

the  Premises or on the  Storage  Area by or at the  election of Tenant.  Tenant
hereby agrees to promptly repair any damage to Tenant's Extra  Improvements  and
any  Alterations  at its sole cost and  expense  in the event that  Landlord  is
required to, or elects to,  repair the  remainder  of the  Premises  pursuant to
Paragraphs  19(a) and 19(b) above  provided  Tenant does not elect to  terminate
this Lease as permitted in this Paragraph 19.

                  (g) Tenant  hereby  waives the  provisions  of subsection 2 of
Section 1932,  subsection 4 of Section  1933,  and Sections 1941 and 1942 of the
California Civil Code.

         20.      EMINENT DOMAIN.

                  (a) If all or part  of the  Premises  shall  be  taken  by any
public or quasi-public authority under the power of eminent domain or conveyance
in lieu thereof, this Lease shall terminate as to any portion of the Premises so
taken or conveyed on the date when title or the right to possession vests in the
condemnor.

                  (b) If (i) a part of the Premises shall be taken by any public
or  quasi-public  authority  under the power of eminent  domain or conveyance in
lieu thereof;  and (ii) Tenant is  reasonably  able to continue the operation of
Tenant's business in that portion of the Premises remaining;  and (iii) Landlord
elects to restore the Premises to an architectural  whole, then this Lease shall
remain in effect as to said  portion of the  Premises  remaining,  and the Basic
Monthly  Rental payable from the date of the taking shall be reduced in the same
proportion  as the area of the  Premises  taken  bears to the total  area of the
Premises.  If, after a partial taking, Tenant is not reasonably able to continue
the operation of its business in the Premises or Landlord  elects not to restore
the Premises as  hereinabove  described,  this Lease may be terminated by either
Landlord or Tenant by giving  written  notice to the other party  within  thirty
(30) days of the date of the  taking.  Such  notice  shall  specify  the date of
termination  which  shall be not less than  thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60)
days after the date of said notice.

                  (c) If a portion of the Building is taken, whether any portion
of the Premises is taken or not, and Landlord  reasonably  determines that it is
not  economically  feasible to continue  operating  the portion of the  Building
remaining,  then Landlord shall have the option for a period of thirty (30) days
after such determination to terminate this Lease. If Landlord determines that it
is  economically  feasible to  continue  operating  the portion of the  Building
remaining  after such  taking,  then this  Lease  shall  remain in effect,  with
Landlord, at Landlord's cost, restoring the Building to an architectural whole.

                  (d) Landlord shall be entitled to any and all payment, income,
rent,  award, or any interest  therein  whatsoever  

                                      40.

<PAGE>

which may be paid or made in  connection  with such  taking or  conveyance,  and
Tenant shall have no claim  against  Landlord or otherwise  for the value of any
unexpired  term of this  Lease.  Tenant  hereby  assigns  any such  claim to the
Landlord.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Tenant shall have the right to make a
claim  directly to the entity  expressing the power of eminent domain for moving
expenses  and for  loss or  damage  to  Tenant's  Extra  Improvements,  Personal
Property, trade fixtures, equipment and movable furniture.

                  (e)    Tenant hereby waives Sections 1265.110 through 1265.160
of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

         21.  HOLDING  OVER.  Any  holding  over after the  expiration  or other
termination  of the term of this Lease  with the  written  consent  of  Landlord
delivered  to Tenant  shall be  construed to be a tenancy from month to month at
the Basic Monthly Rental and the Monthly Storage Rental in effect on the date of
such  expiration or termination  (subject to adjustment as provided in Paragraph
3(c) hereof) on the terms,  covenants and conditions  herein specified so far as
applicable.  Any holding over after the  expiration or other  termination of the
term of this Lease without the written consent of Landlord shall be construed to
be a tenancy at sufferance  on all the terms set forth  herein,  except that the
Basic Monthly Rental and the Monthly  Storage Rental shall be an amount equal to
one hundred  fifty percent  (150%) of the Basic  Monthly  Rental and the Monthly
Storage  Rental  payable  by  Tenant  immediately  prior to such  holding  over.
Acceptance  by Landlord of Rental after the  expiration or  termination  of this
Lease shall not  constitute a consent by Landlord to any such tenancy from month
to month or result in any other  tenancy or any renewal of the term hereof.  The
provisions of this  Paragraph are in addition to, and do not affect,  Landlord's
right to re-entry or other rights hereunder or provided by law.

         22.      MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a)  Limitation  of  Landlord's  Liability.  Any  liability of
Landlord  (including  without  limitation  Landlord's  partners,   shareholders,
affiliates,  agents,  and employees) to Tenant under this Lease shall be limited
to the equity  interest of Landlord in the Real  Property  and Tenant  agrees to
look solely to such interest for the recovery of any judgment, it being intended
that  Landlord and such other  persons  shall not be  personally  liable for any
deficiency  or  judgment.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this Lease,
Landlord shall not be liable for any consequential  damages,  nor shall Landlord
be liable for loss of or damage to artwork,  currency,  jewelry, bullion, unique
or valuable documents,  securities or other valuables, or for other property not
in the nature of ordinary  fixtures,  furnishings  and equipment used in general
administrative  and executive office activities and functions.  Wherever in this
Lease Tenant (a) releases  Landlord from any claim or  


                                      41.
<PAGE>

liability,  (b) waives or limits any right of Tenant to assert any claim against
Landlord or to seek  recourse  against any property of Landlord or (c) agrees to
indemnify Landlord against any matters, the relevant release, waiver, limitation
or  indemnity  shall  run in favor of and apply to  Landlord,  its  agents,  the
constituent  shareholders,  partners or other  owners of Landlord or its agents,
and the directors,  officers,  and employees of Landlord and its agents and each
such constituent shareholder, partner or other owner.

                  (b) Sale by Landlord.  In the event of a sale or conveyance of
the  Building by any owner of the  reversion  then  constituting  Landlord,  the
transferor shall thereby be released from any further  liability upon any of the
terms, covenants or conditions (express or implied) herein contained in favor of
Tenant  after the  effective  date of said  transfer  (provided,  however,  that
Landlord  shall remain liable under the Lease for any  occurrences,  events,  or
breaches under the Lease occurring  prior to the date of said transfer),  and in
such event,  insofar as such  transferor  is  concerned,  Tenant  agrees to look
solely to the  successor in interest of such  transferor  in and to the Building
and this Lease.  Such  successor in interest  shall  automatically  be deemed to
succeed to all the rights,  responsibilities  and  obligations of Landlord under
the  Lease.  Tenant  agrees to  attorn  to the  successor  in  interest  of such
transferor.   If  Tenant  provides  Landlord  with  any  security  for  Tenant's
performance of its obligations hereunder,  and Landlord transfers, or provides a
credit with respect to, such security to the grantee or transferee of Landlord's
interest  in the Real  Property,  Landlord  shall be  released  from any further
responsibility or liability for such security.

                  (c) Estoppel  Letter.  Tenant shall, at any time and from time
to  time  within  ten  (10)  days  following  request  from  Landlord,  execute,
acknowledge and deliver to Landlord a statement in writing,  (i) certifying that
this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified,  stating
the nature of such modification and certifying that this Lease as so modified is
in full force and  effect),  (ii)  certifying  that there are not,  to  Tenant's
knowledge,  any uncured defaults on the part of the Landlord hereunder, and that
Tenant has no defenses to or offsets against its  obligations  under this Lease,
or  specifying  such  defaults,  defenses or offsets if any are  claimed,  (iii)
certifying  the date that Tenant  entered into occupancy of the Premises and the
Storage  Area and  that  Tenant  is open  for  business  in the  Premises,  (iv)
certifying the amount of the Basic Monthly  Rental,  the Monthly  Storage Rental
and the Rental payable under Paragraph 4(b) and the date to which Rental is paid
in advance,  if any, and certifying that Tenant is entitled to no rent abatement
or other  economic  concessions  not specified in the Lease,  (v) certifying the
amount of the Deposit,  if any,  (vi)  certifying  that all  Improvements  to be
constructed  in the  Premises by  Landlord  are  completed  (or  specifying  any
obligations of Landlord  respecting  Improvements),  


                                      42.
<PAGE>

and (vii)  certifying  such other matters  relating to this Lease,  the Premises
and/or the Storage Area as may be reasonably requested by a lender making a loan
to Landlord or a purchaser of the Premises,  the Building,  the Real Property or
any interest  therein from  Landlord.  Any such statement may be relied upon by,
and shall upon Landlord's request be addressed to, any prospective  purchaser or
encumbrancer of all or any portion of the Real Property or any interest therein.
Tenant shall,  within ten (10) days following request of Landlord,  deliver such
other documents  including Tenant's publicly available  financial  statements as
are reasonably  requested in connection  with the sale of, or loan to be secured
by, the Real Property or any part thereof or interest therein.  Tenant's failure
to deliver said statement in the time required  shall be conclusive  upon Tenant
that: (i) the Lease is in full force and effect,  without modification except as
may be represented by Landlord, (ii) there are no uncured defaults in Landlord's
performance and Tenant has no right of offset, counterclaim or deduction against
Rental under the Lease and (iii) no more than one month's Basic  Monthly  Rental
and Monthly Storage Rental has been paid in advance.

                  (d) Financial  Statements.  On or before April 1 of each year,
Tenant  shall  deliver  to  Landlord  Tenant's  publicly   available   financial
statements  ("Financial  Statements") for the fiscal year of Tenant ended on the
previous  December  31,  which  Financial  Statements  shall  include a combined
balance  sheet of Tenant  and its  combined  subsidiaries  as at the end of such
fiscal  year,  a combined  statement  of  operations  of Tenant and its combined
subsidiaries for such fiscal year, and a certificate of Tenant's auditor (or, if
audited Financial  Statements are not available,  then a certificate of Tenant's
Chief  Financial  Officer) to the effect  that such  Financial  Statements  were
prepared  in  accordance   with   generally   accepted   accounting   principles
consistently  applied and fairly present the financial  condition and operations
of Tenant and its  combined  subsidiaries  for and as at the end of such  fiscal
year.

                  (e) Right of Landlord To Perform.  All terms and  covenants of
this Lease to be  performed or observed by Tenant shall be performed or observed
by Tenant at Tenant's  expense and without any  reduction  of Rental.  If Tenant
fails to pay any Rental hereunder or fails to perform any other term or covenant
hereunder  on its part to be  performed,  and such  failure  shall  continue for
fifteen (15) days (or such shorter period as may be reasonable  under  emergency
circumstances)  after  written  notice  thereof by Landlord,  Landlord,  without
waiving or releasing  Tenant from any obligation of Tenant  hereunder,  may make
any such payment or perform any such other term or covenant on Tenant's  part to
be  performed  but shall not be obligated to do so. All sums so paid by Landlord
and all necessary costs of such performance by Landlord,  together with interest
thereon at the  Interest  Rate from the date of such payment or  performance  by
Landlord,  shall be paid (and Tenant covenants to make such 


                                      43.
<PAGE>

payment) to Landlord on demand by Landlord, and Landlord shall have (in addition
to any other right or remedy of  Landlord)  the same rights and  remedies in the
event of  non-payment  thereof  by Tenant as in the case of failure by Tenant in
the payment of Rental hereunder.

                  (f) Rules and Regulations. Tenant agrees to faithfully observe
and to comply with the Building Rules and Regulations attached hereto as Exhibit
B and  incorporated  herein  by this  reference,  and all  modifications  of and
additions  thereto  from  time to time put into  effect  by  Landlord  which are
applicable  to all tenants of the Building and of which Tenant shall have notice
(provided, however, that any modifications of or additions to the Building Rules
and  Regulations  shall  not,  in  any  material   respect,   increase  Tenant's
obligations or decrease Tenant's rights under the Lease).  Landlord shall not be
responsible to Tenant for the non-performance by any other tenant or occupant of
the Building of any of said Building Rules and Regulations.  In the event any of
the Building Rules and Regulations  conflict with any express  provision of this
Lease, the provisions of this Lease shall govern.

                  (g)  Attorneys'  Fees.  In case any  suit or other  proceeding
shall be brought for an unlawful detainer of the Premises or for the recovery of
any Rental due under the  provisions  of this Lease or because of the failure of
performance or observance of any other term or covenant herein  contained on the
part of Landlord or Tenant,  the  unsuccessful  party in such suit or proceeding
shall pay to the prevailing party therein  reasonable  attorneys' fees and costs
which shall include fees and costs of any appeal,  all as fixed by the Court. If
Landlord or Tenant  should be named as a defendant in any suit  brought  against
the other in  connection  with  Tenant's  occupancy of the  Premises  under this
Lease, the party defendant  primarily  responsible for the bringing of such suit
shall pay to the other  party its costs and  expenses  incurred in such suit and
reasonable attorneys' fees.

                  (h) Waiver of Jury Trial. If any action or proceeding  between
Landlord and Tenant to enforce the provisions of this Lease (including an action
or proceeding  between  Landlord and the trustee or debtor in  possession  while
Tenant is a debtor in a proceeding  under any bankruptcy law) proceeds to trial,
Landlord  and Tenant  hereby  waive  their  respective  rights to a jury in such
trial.

                  (i) Waiver.  The failure of Landlord to object to or to assert
any remedy by reason of Tenant's  failure to perform or observe any  covenant or
term  hereof or its failure to assert any rights by reason of the  happening  or
non-happening  of any condition hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of its right
to assert and  enforce  any remedy it may have by reason of such  failure on the
part of Tenant or the happening or  non-happening  of such condition or a waiver
of its rights to enforce any of 


                                      44.

<PAGE>

its rights by reason of any  subsequent  failure of Tenant to perform or observe
the same or any other term or covenant or by reason of the subsequent  happening
or non-happening of the same or any other condition. No custom or practice which
may develop  between the parties hereto during the term hereof shall be deemed a
waiver  of,  or in any  way  affect,  the  right  of  Landlord  to  insist  upon
performance and observance by Tenant in strict accordance with the terms hereof.
The  acceptance  of Rental  hereunder  by  Landlord  shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of any  preceding  failure of Tenant to  perform  or observe  any term or
covenant of this Lease,  other than the failure of Tenant to pay the  particular
Rental so  accepted,  irrespective  of any  knowledge on the part of Landlord of
such preceding failure at the time of acceptance of such Rental.

                  (j) Light,  Air and View.  Tenant agrees that no diminution or
shutting  off of  light,  air or  view by any  structure  which  may be  erected
(whether or not by Landlord) on property  adjacent to the Building  shall in any
way affect this Lease,  entitle  Tenant to any reduction of Rental  hereunder or
result in any liability of Landlord to Tenant.

                  (k)  Notices.  All  notices,  demands,  requests,  advices  or
designations  ("Notices")  which  may be or are  required  to be given by either
party to the other  hereunder  shall be in  writing.  All Notices by Landlord to
Tenant shall be sufficiently  given,  made or delivered if personally  served on
Tenant at the  Premises,  or if sent by United  States  certified or  registered
mail,  postage  prepaid,  addressed to Tenant at Tenant's address for notices as
set forth in the Summary of Lease Terms. All Notices by Tenant to Landlord shall
be sufficiently  given, made or delivered if personally  served on Landlord,  or
sent by United States certified or registered mail,  postage prepaid,  addressed
to Landlord at  Landlord's  address for notices  specified in Paragraph B of the
Summary of Lease  Terms.  Each Notice  shall be deemed  received or given on the
date of the personal service or three (3) days after the mailing thereof, in the
manner herein provided, as the case may be.

                  (l) Name.  Tenant  agrees  that it shall  not,  without  first
obtaining  the  written  consent of Landlord  (which  consent may be withheld in
Landlord's sole and absolute  discretion):  (i) use the name of the Building for
any purpose other than as the address of the business conducted by Tenant in the
Premises,  or (ii) use for any  purpose  any image of,  rendering  of, or design
based on, the exterior appearance or profile of the Building.

                  (m)  Governing  Law;  Severability.  This  Lease  shall in all
respects be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California.
If any provision of this Lease shall be invalid,  unenforceable  or  ineffective
for any reason  whatsoever,  all other provisions  hereof shall be and remain in
effect.


                                      45.
<PAGE>


                  (n) Definitions and Paragraph Headings;  Successors. The words
"include,"  "includes"  and  "including"  shall be deemed to be  followed by the
phrase  "without  limitation."  The term "Landlord" or any pronoun used in place
thereof  includes  the plural as well as the  singular  and the  successors  and
assigns of  Landlord.  The term  "Tenant" or any pronoun  used in place  thereof
includes  the  plural  as  well  as  the  singular   and   individuals,   firms,
associations,  partnerships  and  corporations,  and  their  and  each of  their
respective heirs, executors,  administrators,  successors and permitted assigns,
according to the context hereof. The provisions of this Lease shall inure to the
benefit of and bind Landlord and Tenant and their respective  heirs,  executors,
administrators, successors and permitted assigns. The term "person" includes the
plural  as  well  as  the  singular  and   individuals,   firms,   associations,
partnerships and  corporations.  Words used in any gender include other genders.
If there be more than one Tenant the  obligations of Tenant  hereunder are joint
and  several.  The  paragraph  headings  of this  Lease are for  convenience  of
reference only and shall have no effect upon the construction or  interpretation
of any provision hereof.

                  (o) Time. Time is of the essence of this Lease with respect to
the payment of Rental and the performance of all obligations.

                  (p)  Examination of Lease.  Submission of this  instrument for
examination  or signature  by Tenant does not  constitute  a  reservation  of or
option for a lease, and this instrument is not effective as a lease or otherwise
until its execution and delivery by both Landlord and Tenant.

                  (q) Brokerage.  Tenant  covenants and  represents  that it has
negotiated  this Lease  directly with the Tenant's  Broker(s)  designated on the
Summary of Lease Terms and has not acted by  implication  to authorize,  nor has
authorized,  any other real  estate  broker or  salesman  to act for it in these
negotiations.  Tenant  agrees to protect,  defend,  indemnify  and hold Landlord
harmless from any and all claims,  loss, cost, damage and/or expense (including,
without  limitation,  attorneys'  fees and court costs) by any other real estate
broker  or  salesperson  or other  entity  or party  other  than the  Landlord's
Broker(s)  and  Tenant's  Broker(s)  listed on the  Summary of Lease Terms for a
commission or finder's fee as a result of Tenant's entering into this Lease.

                  (r) Directory Board.  Landlord agrees to list Tenant's name on
the directory board in the lobby of the Building at Landlord's cost and expense;
provided,  however, any change to the initial listing or any additional listings
shall be at Tenant's  cost and expense.  Landlord's  acceptance  of any name for
listing  on the  directory  board  shall in no event be, or be deemed to be, nor
will it substitute for,  Landlord's  consent,  


                                      46.

as required by this Lease,  to any sublease,  assignment,  or other occupancy of
the Premises.

                  (s) Authority.  If Tenant is a corporation  (or other business
organization),  Tenant  represents  and warrants to Landlord  that (a) Tenant is
duly  incorporated  (or  organized)  and validly  existing under the laws of its
state of incorporation (or organization), (b) Tenant is qualified to do business

         23. OPTION TO EXTEND.  Landlord  hereby grants to Tenant one (1) option
(the "Option") to extend the term of the Lease for an additional  period of five
(5) years (the "Option Term), all on the following terms and conditions:

                  (a) The Option must be exercised, if at all, by written notice
irrevocably  exercising  the Option  ("Option  Notice")  delivered  by Tenant to
Landlord not earlier than twelve (12) months nor later than six (6) months prior
to the Expiration Date.  Further,  the Option shall not be deemed to be properly
exercised if, as of the date of the Option Notice or at the Expiration  Date (i)
an Event of Default has  occurred  and is  continuing,  (ii) Tenant has assigned
this Lease or its interest  therein to any person or entity other than  pursuant
to a Permitted  Transfer,  or (iii)  Tenant is  occupying  less than one hundred
percent  (100%) of the  square  footage  of the  Premises.  Provided  Tenant has
properly  and timely  exercised  the  Option,  the term of this  Lease  shall be
extended  for the  period  of the  Option  Term  and all  terms,  covenants  and
conditions of this Lease shall remain  unmodified  and in full force and effect,
except  that the Basic  Monthly  Rental  and  Monthly  Storage  Rental  shall be
modified as set forth in Paragraph 23(b) below.

                  (b) The Basic Monthly  Rental and the Monthly  Storage  Rental
per rentable  square foot ("RSF")  payable for the Option Term shall be equal to
the greater of (i) the  then-current net rental rate per RSF (as further defined
below,  "FMRR")  being  agreed to in new  leases by the  Landlord  or the owners
("Comparable  Owners")  of office  buildings  in the South of  Market/MultiMedia
Gulch area of San  Francisco  which are  comparable  in  quality,  location  and
prestige to the Building (the "Comparable  Buildings") and tenants leasing space
in the Building or the  Comparable  Buildings,  or (ii) the Basic Monthly Rental
and Monthly  Storage Rental per RSF in effect during the last month prior to the
Expiration  Date. As used herein,  "FMRR" shall mean the net rental rate per RSF
for which Landlord and Comparable Owners are entering into new leases within the
time period of eighteen (18) to twelve (12) months prior to the Expiration  Date
("Market  Determination  Period"),  with new or existing  tenants  leasing  from
Landlord  and/or  Comparable  Owners'  office space in the  Building  and/or the
Comparable Owners which space is comparable to the Premises and the Storage Area
in views and other material factors ("Comparative Transactions"). Landlord shall
provide its  determination  of the FMRR to Tenant  within twenty (20) days after
Landlord  receives  the  Option  Notice.  Tenant  shall have  fifteen  (15) days
("Tenant's Review Period") after receipt of Landlord's notice of the FMRR within
which to accept such FMRR or to  reasonably  object  thereto in writing.  In the
event Tenant  objects to the FMRR  submitted  by  Landlord,  Landlord and Tenant
shall  attempt to agree upon such FMRR.  If  Landlord  and Tenant  fail to reach
agreement on such FMRR within fifteen (15) days following Tenant's Review Period
(the "Outside Agreement Date"), then each party shall place in a separate sealed
envelope its final proposal as to FMRR and such 


                                      48.
<PAGE>

determination  shall be submitted to  arbitration  in accordance  with Paragraph
23(c) below.

                  (c) (1)  Landlord and Tenant shall meet with each other within
five (5)  business  days of the Outside  Agreement  Date and exchange the sealed
envelopes and then open such envelopes in each other's presence. If Landlord and
Tenant do not  mutually  agree in writing upon the FMRR within five (5) business
days of the exchange and opening of  envelopes,  then,  within ten (10) business
days of the exchange and opening of  envelopes,  Landlord and Tenant shall agree
upon and jointly appoint one arbitrator who shall be by profession a real estate
appraiser  or broker who shall have been  active  over the five (5) year  period
ending on the date of such  appointment in the leasing of comparable  commercial
properties  in the vicinity of the Building.  Neither  Landlord nor Tenant shall
consult  with such broker or appraiser as to his or her opinion as to FMRR prior
to the appointment.  The determination of the arbitrator shall be limited solely
to the issue of whether  Landlord's or Tenant's  submitted FMRR for the Premises
is the closer to the actual  net rental  rate per RSF for new leases  within the
Market  Determination Period for Comparative  Transactions.  Such arbitrator may
hold such hearings and require such briefs as the arbitrator, in his or her sole
discretion,  determines is necessary. In addition, Landlord or Tenant may submit
to the  arbitrator  with a copy to the other party within five (5) business days
after the appointment of the arbitrator any data and additional information that
such party deems relevant to the  determination  by the arbitrator  ("Data") and
the other  party may submit a reply in writing  within  five (5)  business  days
after receipt of such Data.

                      (2)  The arbitrator shall, within thirty (30) days of his 
or her appointment, reach a decision as to whether the parties shall use
Landlord's or Tenant's  submitted  FMRR, and shall notify Landlord and Tenant of
such  determination.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Lease,  
if Landlord and Tenant cannot agree on the FMRR for the Premises,  Tenant may 
rescind its exercise of the Option by giving  Landlord written notice of such 
election to rescind within ten (10) days after receipt of Landlord's notice of 
arbitration  provided that Landlord receives such notice no later than six (6) 
months prior to the Expiration Date.

                      (3) The decision of the arbitrator  shall be binding  upon
Landlord and Tenant.

                      (4) If  Landlord  and  Tenant  fail to agree upon and
appoint such arbitrator, then the appointment of the arbitrator  shall be made 
by the Presiding  Judge of the Superior  Court for the City and County of San 
Francisco,  or, if he or she refuses to act, by any judge having jurisdiction 
over the parties.

                                      49.

                      (5) The cost of arbitration shall be paid by Landlord
and Tenant equally.

         24.      RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER.

                  (a)  Whenever,  during the term of this Lease,  a lease by any
third party of any space on the First Floor of the Building  expires (and is not
extended  or  replaced  with  a new  lease  to  the  same  party)  or  otherwise
terminates,  and such space (the "Available Space") becomes available for lease,
Landlord shall give Tenant written notice of such availability,  identifying the
same and specifying the basic terms and conditions on which Landlord proposes to
lease the  Available  Space (the "Space Offer  Notice"),  including  basic rent,
tenant improvement  allowance (if any) and term. The Space Offer Notice shall be
given not more than eight (8)  months nor less than two (2) months  prior to the
date Tenant would be required to commence  paying rent for the  Available  Space
(the "New Space  Commencement  Date").  Tenant shall have ten (10) business days
after its receipt of the Space Offer  Notice in which  Tenant may give  Landlord
written  notice of Tenant's  acceptance of the Available  Space on the terms and
conditions specified in the Availability Notice (the "Space Acceptance Notice").
Landlord hereby represents and warrants that the current lease for the Available
Space  terminates  under its terms on July 1, 2004 (the "Available Space Lease")
and,  notwithstanding  anything  contained in this Paragraph 24 to the contrary,
Landlord hereby agrees that it will not extend the term of the "Available  Space
Lease" beyond said date without first offering to Tenant the Available  Space in
accordance with this Paragraph 24.

                  (b) Prior to giving the Space  Offer  Notice to Tenant and for
ten (10) business days  thereafter,  Landlord  shall not enter into any lease of
the Available Space with any other person.  If during such ten (10) business day
period  Tenant gives  Landlord a Space  Acceptance  Notice,  Landlord and Tenant
shall then  promptly  enter into an amendment to this Lease adding the Available
Space to the Premises on the terms and  conditions  specified in the Space Offer
Notice with respect to the Available Space only.

                  (c) If Tenant has not given Landlord a Space Acceptance Notice
within ten (10) business days after Tenant's  receipt of the Space Offer Notice,
then Landlord shall be free to lease the Available  Space to any other person or
entity on any terms and conditions;  provided,  however, that Landlord shall not
lease  the  Available  Space to any  other  person  or  entity  on  basic  terms
materially  less  favorable to Landlord  than those set forth in the Space Offer
Notice  without first giving Tenant at least five (5) days prior written  notice
of such proposed lease and the  opportunity  (during such five (5) day period by
delivery of written notice to Landlord) to agree to lease the Available Space on
the same terms and  conditions as those of such proposed  lease.  In determining
whether  "lease terms" are  materially  less 


                                      50.
<PAGE>

favorable  than the terms  offered to Tenant,  no terms other than rent,  tenant
improvement allowance (if any) and minimum term shall be considered.

                  (d) Tenant's  rights under this  Paragraph 24 shall be subject
and subordinate to Landlord's right after the Commencement Date to enter into an
agreement with any existing tenant of the Available Space (other that the tenant
under the  Available  Space  Lease)  as to  continuing  occupancy  of all or any
portion of the Available Space. Any space which is subject to such a prior right
or subsequent  agreement shall not be deemed available for lease for purposes of
this Paragraph 24.

                  (e) If Tenant shall  exercise the right of first offer granted
herein,  Landlord does not guarantee that the Available  Space will be available
on the projected  commencement date for the lease thereof,  if the then existing
occupants of the Available Space shall hold over, or for any other reason beyond
Landlord's reasonable control. In such event, rent with respect to the Available
Space shall be abated until  Landlord  legally  delivers the same to Tenant,  as
Tenant's sole recourse.

                  (f) The  right of first  offer  herein  shall,  at  Landlord's
election,  be null and void,  if (i) an Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing  under the Lease on the date Tenant exercises its rights hereunder or
on the commencement  date of the lease for the Available Space, or (ii) Landlord
has given to Tenant  two (2) or more  notices  of  default  under this Lease and
Tenant  actually was in default of the Lease during the twelve (12) month period
prior to the time  that  Landlord  would  be  required  to  provide  Tenant  the
Availability  Notice.  If the  Lease  or  Tenant's  right to  possession  of the
Premises shall terminate in any manner  whatsoever  before Tenant shall exercise
the right herein provided,  or if Tenant shall have subleased any portion of the
Premises or assigned  all or any portion of the Lease  (except in the event of a
Permitted  Transfer),  then  immediately  upon  such  termination,  sublease  or
assignment,  the  rights to lease  the  Available  Space  herein  granted  shall
simultaneously  terminate  and become  null and void.  Such right is personal to
Tenant. Under no circumstances whatsoever shall the assignee under a complete or
partial assignment of the Lease, or a subtenant under a sublease of the Premises
or any part thereof, have any right to exercise the right of first offer granted
herein;  provided,  however,  that in the event of an  assignment  of this Lease
which is a Permitted Transfer, such permitted transferee shall have the right of
first offer  granted  herein.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this
Lease and subject to the  provisions  of this  Paragraph 24, this right of first
offer shall be a  continuing  right  which  shall  remain in effect at all times
during the term of this Lease and any extended term hereof.

         25. TENANT'S SIGNS. Tenant shall have the right to place signage on the
exterior of the Building and in the lobby of the 


                                      51.

<PAGE>

Building.  Any such signage is subject to all applicable laws, codes,  rules and
regulations  and to the approval of the City and County of San Francisco and the
reasonable  approval of Landlord as to design,  location and materials used. Any
sign must be prepared by a professional sign company.  Tenant shall maintain all
signs at its cost and  expense.  If Tenant  fails to maintain its signs and such
failure continues for a period of ten (10) days after notice thereof by Landlord
without  Tenant  having  undertaken  diligent  efforts to complete  the required
maintenance,  Landlord  may,  but shall not be  obligated,  to perform  any such
required  maintenance.  Tenant  shall  promptly pay to Landlord the cost of such
required maintenance as additional rent. At the termination of the Lease, Tenant
shall remove all its signs,  and all damage  caused by such removal  shall be at
Tenant's expense.

         26.  PARKING.  Tenant  may lease on a monthly  basis  twenty-four  (24)
parking spaces in the Building (the "Building Lot") and forty-eight  (48) spaces
in the 345 Brannan  Street lot (the "345 Brannan Street Lot") (such spaces to be
collectively  referred to as the "Existing  Parking").  Landlord shall also make
commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  provide  Tenant  with  up  to  eight  (8)
additional  parking spaces (the "Additional  Parking") in the 345 Brannan Street
Lot or an  alternative  lot (the  "Alternative  Lot") within 500 feet of the 345
Brannan Street Lot. The Additional  Parking shall be subject to availability (as
determined in Landlord's reasonable discretion),  at market rates (as determined
in  Landlord's  reasonable   discretion)  and  subject  to  annual  escalations.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Lease,  Landlord hereby agrees
that at all  times  during  the  term of  this  Lease,  Tenant  shall  have  the
continuing  right to lease the Existing  Parking and the right to park up to two
(2)  motorcycles  in one (1) parking space at no additional  charge.  The use by
Tenant, its employees and invitees of these parking lots shall be subject to the
rules and regulations  established from time to time by the owner or operator of
the lots.  Landlord  shall not  "restripe"  or  otherwise  improve  any of these
parking lots unless  required to do so by law.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary in this Lease, the Building Lot and the 345 Brannan Street Lot shall be
managed and maintained in a first class manner and condition  comparable to that
of parking facilities owned by Comparable Landlords.

         27.      BRIDGE ACCESS.

                  (a) One (1) one-story  bridge extends from the second floor of
the Building and one (1)  two-story  bridge  extends from the third floor of the
Building  (collectively,  "the  Bridges"),  respectively,  toward the second and
third stories of that certain building commonly known as 35 Stanford Street, San
Francisco,  California (the "Stanford Street Property"), which Bridges are owned
by the Landlord.  Tenant may connect the second and third floors of the Premises
to  the  Stanford  Street  


                                      52.
<PAGE>

Property by extending the existing  Bridges,  and  performing any other required
improvements (collectively, the "Connection Alterations"), subject to applicable
laws and to  Landlord's  approval  of the plans for such  work,  which  approval
Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute  discretion.  Tenant shall accept
the Bridges on an "as-is" basis.  Landlord makes no  representations or warranty
regarding  the  Bridges  with  respect to their  condition  or  suitability  for
Tenant's intended use.

                  (b) Provided  Tenant  constructs the  Connection  Alterations,
Tenant  shall  be  responsible  for all  required  maintenance  of the  Bridges,
pursuant to Paragraph 9 of the Lease.  Provided Tenant constructs the Connection
Alterations,  Tenant also shall be  responsible  for the costs of all  utilities
used in or in connection with the Bridges, and such costs shall be excluded from
the definition of "Operating Expenses." The liability insurance that Tenant must
maintain  pursuant  to  Paragraph  14 of the Lease  shall  cover the Bridges and
Tenant's  use  of  the  Bridges.   Provided  Tenant  constructs  the  Connection
Alterations,  Tenant  hereby  agrees  to  indemnify,  defend  and hold  harmless
Landlord  and its  Indemnitees  from and against  any and all  claims,  demands,
damages, expenses, losses, costs and liabilities, including, without limitation,
reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses,  incurred by, imposed on or payable by
Landlord  arising out of any act or omission by any person who has gained access
to the Real Property  through the Bridges or the Stanford  Street  Property,  or
arising out of the condition of the Bridges or otherwise related to the Bridges;
this  indemnity  shall  survive the  termination  of this Lease as to conditions
arising  and events  occurring  prior to the  termination  of this  Lease.  Upon
termination of this Lease,  Tenant shall,  at Tenant's cost,  cause the Stanford
Street  Property-end  of the  Bridges to be sealed and  finished  to  Landlord's
reasonable satisfaction.

         Tenant shall provide Landlord with a deposit,  escrow account or letter
of credit equal to the  Landlord's  reasonable  estimate of the cost of removing
the Connection Alterations and restoring the Bridges to their condition prior to
construction of the Connection  Alterations (the "Connection  Removal Security")
at  the  expiration  of  the  Lease  term.  If  Tenant  removes  the  Connection
Alterations and restores the Bridges to their condition prior to construction of
the Connection  Alterations on or before the expiration or sooner termination of
this  Lease,  and such  work is  performed  to the  reasonable  satisfaction  of
Landlord,  Landlord shall immediately  return the Connection Removal Security to
Tenant. If Tenant fails to remove the Connection Alterations upon the expiration
or sooner  termination of this Lease,  Landlord may use the  Connection  Removal
Security to remove said Connection Alterations and restore the Bridges and shall
immediately  return any remaining  amount of the Connection  Removal Security to
Tenant.


                                      53.
<PAGE>

         28. TENANT ALLOWANCE.  On the Commencement Date, Landlord shall provide
Tenant with a tenant improvement  allowance in the amount of four hundred twelve
thousand six hundred  eighty-five  and 00/100  dollars  ($412,685.00)  which sum
Tenant shall use for  improvements  of and to the Premises or for other  related
costs.

         29. APPROVALS.  Except as otherwise  expressly  provided in this Lease,
whenever the Lease requires an approval, consent, designation,  determination or
judgment by either  Landlord or Tenant,  such  approval,  consent,  designation,
determination  or  judgment  shall  be  reasonable,  shall  not be  unreasonably
withheld or delayed and, in exercising any right or remedy hereunder, each party
shall at all times act reasonably and in good faith.

         30. LICENSE AGREEMENT.  Concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Lease, Landlord and Tenant shall execute 


                                      54.
<PAGE>
and deliver a License Agreement in the form attached to this Lease as Exhibit D.


31.  TERMINATION OF EXISTING LEASES.  Upon the Commencement  Date of this Lease,
the  Existing  Leases  (as  defined  in  Paragraph  22(u))  shall  automatically
terminate without any further action by Landlord or Tenant;  provided,  however,
that  any  obligations  which  arose  under  the  Existing  Leases  prior to the
Commencement Date shall survive such termination.

         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  Landlord and Tenant have  executed and  delivered
this Lease as of the day and year first above written.

         1. Sidewalks, halls, passages, exits, entrances,  elevators, escalators
and stairways shall not be obstructed by tenants or used by them for any purpose
other than for ingress to and egress from their respective premises.  The halls,
passages, exits, entrances,  elevators, escalators and stairways are not for the
use of the general  public and  Landlord  shall in all cases retain the right to
control  and  prevent  access  thereto by all  persons  whose  presence,  in the
reasonable judgment of Landlord, would be prejudicial to the safety,  character,
reputation and interests of the Building and its tenants.

         2. Except as permitted in the License Agreement and the Lease, no sign,
placard,  picture,  name,  advertisement or notice, visible from the exterior of
leased premises shall be inscribed,  painted,  affixed or otherwise displayed by
any tenant either on its premises or any part of the Building  without the prior
written  consent of Landlord,  and  Landlord  shall have the right to remove any
such sign, placard,  picture, name,  advertisement,  or notice without notice to
and at the expense of the tenant.

                  If Landlord shall have given such consent to any tenant at any
time,  whether before or after the execution of the Lease, such consent shall in
no way operate as a waiver or release of any of the provisions hereof or of such
Lease,  and  shall be deemed to relate  only to the  particular  sign,  placard,
picture, name, advertisement or notice so consented to by Landlord and shall not
be construed as dispensing with the necessity of obtaining the specific  written
consent of Landlord with respect to any other such sign, placard, picture, name,
advertisement or notice.

                  No signs will be  permitted  on any entry door unless the door
is glass. All glass door signs must be approved by Landlord.  Signs or lettering
shall be printed,  painted, affixed or inscribed at the expense of the tenant by
a person approved by Landlord.

         3. The bulletin  board or  directory  of the Building  will be provided
exclusively  for the  display  of the  name and  location  of  tenants  only and
Landlord  reserves  the right to exclude  any other  names  therefrom.  Landlord
reserves the right to restrict the amount of directory space utilized by Tenant.

         4. No curtains,  draperies,  blinds, shutters, shades, screens or other
coverings,  hangings or decorations  shall be attached to, hung or placed in, or

Landlord,  all such  items  shall be  installed  inside of  Landlord's  standard
draperies and shall in no way be visible from the exterior of the  Building.  No

all  persons  who do not  present a pass to the  Building  signed  by  Landlord.
Landlord will furnish passes to persons for whom any tenant requests the same in
writing.  Each tenant shall be responsible  for all persons for whom it requests
passes and shall be liable to Landlord for all acts of such persons.

                  Landlord  shall in no case be liable for damages for any error
with regard to the admission to or exclusion from the Building of any person.

                  During any invasion,  mob,  riot,  public  excitement or other
circumstance  rendering such action advisable in Landlord's  reasonable opinion,
Landlord  reserves  the right to prevent  access to the  Building by closing the
doors,  or otherwise,  for the safety of tenants and  protection of the Building
and property in the Building.

         6. No tenant shall employ any person or persons  other than the janitor

by Landlord in writing.  Except with the written consent of Landlord,  no person
or persons other than those approved by Landlord shall be permitted to enter the
Building  for the  purpose  of  cleaning  the same.  No tenant  shall  cause any
unnecessary labor by reason of such tenant's carelessness or indifference in the
preservation  of  good  order  and  cleanliness.  Landlord  shall  in no  way be
responsible  to any tenant for any loss of  property  on the  Premises,  however
occurring,  or for any damage done to the  property of any tenant by the janitor
or any other  employee or any other  person.  Janitorial  service  shall include
ordinary dusting and cleaning by the janitor assigned to such work and shall not
include  beating or cleaning of carpets or rugs or moving of  furniture or other

without  interfering  with the occupants.  Window cleaning shall be done only by
Landlord, and at such intervals and such hours as Landlord shall deem reasonably
appropriate.

         7. No tenant  shall  obtain  for use upon its  premises  ice,  drinking

bootblacking  services  in its  premises,  except  from  persons  authorized  by
Landlord,  which authorization shall not be unreasonably  withheld, and at hours
and under regulations fixed by Landlord.

Tenant shall make good all injuries  sustained by other  tenants or occupants of
the  Building.  On  multiple-tenancy  floors all tenants  shall keep the door or

         16.  Landlord will direct  electricians  as to where and how telephone,

                                       4.
<PAGE>

         25.  Landlord may waive any one or more of these Rules and  Regulations
for the  benefit of any  particular  tenant or  tenants,  but no such  waiver by
Landlord  shall be construed as a waiver of such Rules and  Regulations in favor
of any other tenant or tenants,  nor prevent Landlord from thereafter  enforcing
any such Rules and Regulations against any or all tenants of the Building.

         26. These Rules and  Regulations  may be changed from time to time,  as
Landlord may deem reasonably appropriate,  and are in addition to, and shall not

                                LICENSE AGREEMENT


         THIS LICENSE  AGREEMENT  (the  "Agreement")  is made as of August 1,
1998,  by and between SOMA  PARTNERS,  L.P., a  California  limited  partnership
("Licensor"),  and ADVENT SOFTWARE,  INC., a Delaware corporation  ("Licensee"),
with reference to the following recitals:

                                                     RECITALS

         A.  Licensor and Licensee  entered into that certain Lease of even date
herewith (the  "Lease").  Pursuant to the Lease,  Licensee  leases from Licensor
certain premises consisting of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors
located in the building (the  "Building")  commonly known as 301 Brannan Street,
in the  City of San  Francisco,  State  of  California  (the  "Premises").  Each
capitalized term used in this Agreement,  but not defined herein, shall have the
meaning ascribed to it in the Lease.

         B. Licensee desires to install, operate and maintain telecommunications
or satellite  equipment,  generators  and/or signage on the roof of the Premises
(the "Roof"), and Licensor desires to grant Licensee a license for this purpose,
all on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

         THEREFORE,  for good and  valuable  consideration,  receipt of which is
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

         1. License.  Licensor hereby grants to Licensee,  subject to all of the
terms and  conditions  contained in this  Agreement,  an exclusive  license (the
"License") to install,  operate and maintain on a five hundred (500) square foot
area of the Roof (as shown on Exhibit A attached hereto) (the "Licensed  Area"),
and to remove therefrom,  telecommunications or satellite equipment,  generators
and/or  signage  (the  design  and  materials  of such  signage to be subject to
Landlord's  reasonable  consent and applicable laws and regulations),  as may be
required  by  Licensee  during  the term of the Lease or any  extension  thereof
(collectively,  the "Equipment").  The License includes the right to have access
to the Roof in connection with the use thereof as permitted herein.

         2. Licensor's Recapture Option;  License  Termination.  If Licensee has
not  exercised its rights under the License to use the License Area on or before
two (2) years after the Commencement  Date of the Lease,  then Licensor may send
written  notice to  Licensee  requesting  use of the  License  Area  ("Recapture
Notice").  Within ten (10) days of the  Recapture  Notice,  Licensee must notify
Licensor in writing of its intent to use the License  Area. If Licensee does not
so notify Licensor within such period, Licensee's rights under this License will
terminate.  If  Licensee  notifies  Licensor in 


                                      -1-
<PAGE>

writing of its intent to use the License Area, it must install or  substantially
undertake  the  installation  of the Equipment in the License Area within thirty
(30) days of such  notification.  If Licensee does not  substantially  undertake
such installation within such period,  Licensee's rights under this License will
expire at the end of such period.

         3. Use.  Licensee  shall use the License Area only in  connection  with
Licensee's or its  successors'  or its assigns' (in  connection  with  Permitted
Transfer)  operations in the Premises.  Licensee's use of the License Area shall
not interfere with the  maintenance or operation of any other  equipment  and/or
structure  that  is  located  on the  Roof at the  time  Licensee  installs  the
Equipment  in the  License  Area.  Licensee  shall  have  access  to the Roof as
required  for  the  installation,  operation,  maintenance  and  removal  of the
Equipment. No changes,  modifications,  additions or substitutions shall be made
to the Equipment without the prior written approval of Licensor, which shall not
be  unreasonably  withheld;  provided,  however,  that  Licensee  may remove the
Equipment  at any time during the term of this  Agreement  or the Lease  without
Licensor's  consent.  If Licensee  removes all of the Equipment,  Licensee shall
provide  Licensor  with  written  notice of such  removal  within  ten (10) days
thereof, and this Agreement shall terminate upon the date of such removal.

         4. Condition of Roof.  Licensee  acknowledges that the License Area and
the Roof shall be used by  Licensee  pursuant to the License on an "as is" basis
and that  Licensor has not made any  representation  or warranty  regarding  the
License Area or the Roof with respect to its suitability  for the  installation,
maintenance  or  operation  of the  Equipment.  Licensee's  decision  to use the
License  Area is based on  Licensee's  own  investigation  and  analysis  of the
License  Area.  Licensee  shall be obligated,  at its sole cost and expense,  to
repair  any and all  damage  caused  by  Licensee's  installation,  maintenance,
operation  or  removal of the  Equipment  in the  License  Area or  exercise  of
Licensee's rights under this License.

         5.  Maintenance.  Licensee  shall  repair any damage to the Roof or the
Premises  caused  by its  use  of  the  License  Area  or by  the  installation,
operation,  maintenance  or  removal  of  the  Equipment.  Following  Licensee's
installation  of the Equipment in the License Area,  Licensee shall maintain the
License Area to the extent such maintenance is required due to Licensee's use of
the  License  Area  or as a  result  of  Licensee's  Equipment  or  exercise  of
Licensee's rights under this License,  and Licensor shall have no responsibility
to maintain or operate the Equipment.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Licensee shall have no obligations under this Agreement until
Licensee exercises any of its rights under this License.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>


         6. Utilities.  Licensee shall be responsible for the actual cost of all
utilities  consumed in connection with the use of the License and shall pay such
cost either  directly to the utility  provider or to the Landlord as  additional
rent,  and  such  cost  shall be  excluded  from the  definition  of  "Operating
Expenses" under the Lease.

         7.  Assignment and  Subletting.  Except in connection  with a Permitted
Transfer,  Licensee  shall not:  (a) assign,  encumber,  transfer or convey this
License or any interest in this License; (b) allow any assignment or transfer of
Licensee's  interest in this License,  whether by operation of law or otherwise;
or (c) permit the use of the License  Area,  the Roof or the Equipment by anyone
other than  Licensee.  Any attempted  assignment,  sublease or other transfer by
Licensee of all or any interest in the License Area or this License in violation
of this paragraph  shall be void and of no legal effect and shall  constitute an
event of default under this License.

         8. Rules and  Regulations.  Licensee  shall comply with any  reasonable
rules and regulations  Licensor may enact with respect to the use of the License
Area or Roof and/or the installation, operation or maintenance of the Equipment.

         9.  Insurance.  The  liability  insurance  that  Licensee must maintain
pursuant to Paragraph 14 of the Lease shall cover the Roof and Licensee's use of
the License.

         10. Indemnity.  Licensee agrees to indemnify,  defend and hold harmless
Licensor, its agents, officers,  directors,  shareholders,  partners, employees,
servant  from and  against  any and all  claims,  liabilities,  demands,  costs,
damages,  losses,  actions,  causes of action or judgments (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses)  (the  "Losses")  which result from or arise out of the
installation,  existence, operation,  maintenance or removal of the Equipment or
Licensee's  use of the License,  except to the extent any such Losses are caused
by the gross  negligence or willful  misconduct of Licensor or its  Indemnitees.
Licensee's  obligations  under this  paragraph  shall survive the  expiration or
earlier termination of this Agreement.

         11.  Termination;   Default.  The  License  and  this  Agreement  shall
automatically  terminate in the event the Lease  terminates  for any reason.  In
addition,  Licensor may elect to terminate the License and this Agreement at any
time upon written notice to Licensee;  provided, however, Licensor agrees not to
exercise  such right unless (i) Licensee has failed to cure any default under or

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Advent is a leading  provider of  stand-alone  and  client/server  software
products,  data  interfaces and related  maintenance and services that automate,
integrate  and  support  mission-critical  functions  of  investment  management
organizations.   Our  clients  vary  significantly  in  size  and  assets  under
management and include investment advisors, brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds,
corporations, public funds, universities and non-profit organizations.

ACQUISITIONS

     In February 1996, we acquired Data Exchange, Inc. (the DX Group), a private
company based in New York, for $4.0 million in cash and an $800,000  note.  This
note was paid during the third  quarter of 1996 and did not bear  interest.  The
transaction  was  accounted  for as a  purchase.  We  incurred  a charge of $5.6
million in connection with the write-off of in-process research and development.

     In November  1996,  we issued 35,000 shares of common stock in exchange for
all of the  outstanding  shares  of Bold  Software,  Inc.,  a  private  software
development  company based in New York. This business  combination was accounted
for as a pooling of  interests.  Prior year  amounts  have not been  restated to
include  Bold   Software's   results  of  operations  as  such  operations  were
immaterial.  As a result of this  business  combination,  we  introduced  Advent
Partner,  a tax layering and partnership  allocation  solution which  integrates
with Axys.

     In February  1998, we issued 250,000 shares of common stock in exchange for
all of the outstanding shares of MicroEdge, Inc., a leading provider of software
products to foundations,  corporations  and other  organizations to manage their
grant-making  activities.  This  business  combination  was  accounted  for as a
pooling of interests  and the results of operations of MicroEdge are included in
the financial statements beginning January 1, 1998. The results of operations as
well as the assets and  liabilities  of MicroEdge in 1997, or prior years,  were
not material to the  consolidated  results of operations or financial  position.
Accordingly,  we did not restate our financial  statements  for periods prior to
January 1, 1998.

     In May 1998, we issued 170,000 shares of common stock for certain assets of
the Grants  Management  Division of  Blackbaud,  Inc., a privately  held company
located in Charleston,  South Carolina. Through this acquisition we combined the
Grants Management product line of Blackbaud with MicroEdge. This transaction was
accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  of the business and
assets  acquired  are  included  in our  financial  statements  from the date of
acquisition.   We  incurred  a  charge  relating  to  in-process   research  and
development  and  other  expenses  of  $5.4  million  in  connection  with  this
transaction.

     In November  1998,  we issued  15,000  shares of common stock and paid $4.1
million  in  exchange  for all the  outstanding  shares  of Hub  Data,  Inc.,  a
distributor  of  consolidated  securities  information  and  data to  investment
management  organizations.  Hub Data is located in  Cambridge,  MA and  delivers
services to over 240 institutional  investment firms. This business  combination
was  accounted  for as a purchase.  We incurred a charge  relating to in-process
research and development of $3.0 million in connection with this transaction.

     In November  1998,  we paid AUS  $583,000  (approximately  US  $370,000) in
exchange for all the outstanding  shares of Portfolio  Management  Systems Pty.,
Ltd., a distributor of Advent products in Australia.  This business  combination
was accounted for as a purchase.  This acquisition will provide an international
channel for sale of our products and services. Subsequent to the acquisition, we
changed the name of this subsidiary to Advent Australia.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1997 AND 1996

REVENUES

     Net revenues were $71 million,  $48.6  million,  and $36.7 million in 1998,
1997, and 1996,  respectively,  representing  increases of 46% from 1997 to 1998
and 32% from  1996 to 1997.  Our net  revenues  are  derived  from  license  and
development  fees,  maintenance and other recurring  revenues,  and professional
services and other revenues related to our software  products.  In each of 1998,
1997 and 1996,  substantially  all of our net revenues were from domestic sales,
with  international  sales  representing  less than 3% of net revenues.  License
revenues are derived from the licensing of software  products while  development
fees are derived from development contracts that we have entered into with other
companies,  including customers and development partners.  Maintenance and other
recurring  revenues  are derived  from  maintenance  fees charged in the initial
licensing year, renewals of annual maintenance  services in subsequent years and
revenues  derived from client  utilization of  proprietary  interfaces to access
pricing and other data  supplied by third  parties.  Professional  services  and
other revenues  includes fees for  consulting,  implementation  and  integration
management, custom programming, training services and semi-annual conferences.

     Axys and its related  products and services  accounted  for the majority of
net  revenues  in 1998,  1997 and  1996.  However,  we have been  successful  in
increasing  multi-product  sales  by  emphasizing  our  suite of  products  and,
therefore, new products have accounted for an increasing portion of net revenues
in all three years.

     Each  of  the  major  revenue  categories  has  historically  varied  as  a
percentage of net revenues and we expect this  variability to continue in future
periods.  This variability is primarily due to the timing of the introduction of
new products,  the relative size and timing of individual  licenses,  as well as
the  complexity  of  the  implementation,   the  resulting   proportion  of  the
maintenance and professional  services components of these license  transactions
and the amount of client utilization of pricing and related data.

     LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT  FEES.  License and development  fees revenues were
$36.6  million,  $23.7  million  and  $17.0  million  in 1998,  1997  and  1996,
respectively,  representing increases of 54% from 1997 to 1998 and 40% from 1996
to 1997.  License and development  fees revenues as a percentage of net revenues
were  52%,  49% and 46% in  1998,  1997 and  1996,  respectively.  The  relative
increase from year to year was  primarily due to continued  demand for our suite
of products and increased development fees. We typically license our products on
a per  server,  per user  basis  with the  price per site  varying  based on the
selection of the products  licensed and the number of  authorized  users.  As we
carry out larger  implementations and continue our Internet  Initiative,  we may
enter into further development contracts through which we earn development fees.
In 1998,  license  revenues also  increased due to an increase of  multi-product
transactions.   We  expect  these   transactions  to  continue  to  represent  a
significant  proportion  of  revenues.  In  addition,  to a lesser  extent,  the
acquisition  of  MicroEdge  also  contributed  to the  increase  of license  and
development fees revenue.

     MAINTENANCE AND OTHER RECURRING.  Maintenance and other recurring  revenues
were $25.5  million,  $18.0  million and $14.7  million in 1998,  1997 and 1996,
respectively,  representing increases of 42% from 1997 to 1998 and 23% from 1996
to 1997.  Maintenance  and other  recurring  revenues,  as a  percentage  of net
revenues, were 36%, 37% and 40% in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The growth
in maintenance and other recurring revenues, in absolute dollars, in all periods
was primarily due to a larger customer base and higher average maintenance fees.
Higher  average  maintenance  fees are due to the  increased  complexity  of the
maintenance  services  provided and increased client  utilization of proprietary
interfaces to access  pricing and other data supplied by external  parties.  Our
proprietary  interfaces  enable  users of Axys to  retrieve  critical  data from
external  sources,  including  pricing,  corporate  actions,  and analytical and
fundamental  data via  interfaces to  information  vendors,  such as Interactive
Data. The decrease in maintenance and other  recurring  revenues as a percentage
of net  revenues,  from year to year,  is due to license  and  development  fees
revenue increasing at a faster rate. In addition,  in 1998, increased demand for
implementation  management  services  and the growth of our  client  base due to
multi-product  transactions contributed to the increase in maintenance and other
recurring  revenues.  To a lesser extent,  the acquisitions we made in 1998 also
contributed to the rise in maintenance and other recurring revenues.

     PROFESSIONAL  SERVICES AND OTHER.  Professional Services and other revenues
were  $8.9  million,  $6.9  million  and $5.1  million  in 1998,  1997 and 1996,
respectively,  representing increases of 29% from 1997 to 1998 and 35% from 1996
to 1997.  Professional  services  and  other  revenues  as a  percentage  of net
revenues were relatively  stable at 12% for 1998 and 14% for both 1996 and 1997.
We expect  professional  services  and other  revenue  to remain in the range of
12-14% as a  percentage  of net  revenue in the  future.  The  increase  of $2.0
million  from  1997  to 1998  and  $1.8  million  from  1996 to 1997  was due to
additional  consulting revenue associated with higher product sales activity and
additional  interface business resulting from 


<PAGE>


higher market demand for automated  interfaces.  In 1998,  the increase was also
attributed to increased consulting fees and, to a lesser extent, the acquisition
of MicroEdge.

COST OF REVENUES

     COST OF LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT  FEES. Cost of license and development fees
revenues  were $2.9  million,  $601,000,  and  $600,000 in 1998,  1997 and 1996,
respectively,  representing  8%,  3%  and 4% of  license  and  development  fees
revenues in these periods,  respectively.  Cost of license and development  fees
revenue  consists  primarily  of the  cost of  product  media  and  duplication,
manuals,  packaging  materials  and the direct labor  involved in producing  and
distributing  our software.  The increase from 1997 to 1998 was primarily due to
costs  associated  with increased  development  fee projects which have a higher
cost of revenue.

     COST OF MAINTENANCE  AND OTHER  RECURRING.  Cost of  maintenance  and other
recurring  revenues  were $6.3  million,  $4.8 million and $3.8 million in 1998,
1997 and 1996,  respectively,  representing  25%, 27% and 26% of maintenance and
other  recurring  revenues  in these  periods,  respectively.  These  costs  are
primarily comprised of the direct costs of providing technical support and other
services  for  recurring  revenues and the  engineering  costs  associated  with
product updates. These expenses, in absolute dollars, increased in each year due
to  increased  staffing  required  to  support a larger  customer  base and more
complex  implementations.  From 1997 to 1998,  maintenance  and other  recurring
revenues  as a  percentage  of  related  revenues  decreased  due  primarily  to
economies of scale.

     COST OF PROFESSIONAL  SERVICES AND OTHER. Cost of professional services and
other  revenues were $3.9 million,  $3.6 million and $2.5 million in 1998,  1997
and 1996,  respectively,  representing 44%, 53% and 49% of professional services
and other revenues in these periods, respectively. These costs consist primarily
of personnel related costs of the client services and support  organization that
are incurred in providing  consulting,  custom programming,  conversions of data
from clients' previous systems,  and cost of hosting our client conferences.  To
the extent that such personnel are not fully  utilized in consulting,  training,
conversion  or custom  programming  projects,  they are  allocated  to presales,
marketing and  engineering  activities  and the  resultant  costs are charged to
operating  expenses.  Cost of  professional  services  and  other,  in  absolute
dollars,  increased year to year due to increase  staffing  necessary to provide
services to an  expanded  installed  base.  Cost of  professional  services as a
percentage of related  revenues  increased in 1997 from 1996 due to the increase
in personnel  dedicated to  accelerating  the conversion of existing  clients to
Axys  Release  2. Cost of  professional  services  as a  percentage  of  related
revenues decreased in 1998 due primarily to economies of scale.

OPERATING EXPENSES

     SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses were $23.5 million, $15.6
million and $12.4  million in 1998,  1997 and 1996,  respectively,  representing
increases  of 51%  from  1997 to 1998  and 25%  from  1996 to  1997.  Sales  and
marketing expenses,  as a percentage of net revenues remained steady at 33%, 32%
and 34% in 1998,  1997 and  1996,  respectively.  Sales and  marketing  expenses
consist primarily of costs of all personnel  involved in the sales and marketing
process,  sales  commissions,   advertising  and  promotional  materials,  sales
facilities  expense,  trade shows,  and seminars.  Sales and marketing  expenses
increased from 1997 to 1998 due to the continued increase in sales and marketing
employees and increased marketing expenses related to new product  introductions
such as Advent Office,  Advent Browser Reporting and Advent Warehouse as well as
focused  sales and  marketing  efforts  towards  our  Internet  Initiative.  The
increase  from  1996 to 1997  was due to  increased  headcount  and new  product
introductions.

     PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  Product development expenses were $12.6 million, $9.4
million  and $6.7  million in 1998,  1997 and 1996,  respectively,  representing
increases  of 33%  from  1997  to 1998  and  40%  from  1996  to  1997.  Product
development  expenses as a percentage of net revenues were relatively  stable at
18%,  19% and 18% in 1998,  1997 and  1996,  respectively.  Product  development
expenses  consist  primarily  of  personnel  costs as we  increase  our  product
development  efforts  to  accelerate  the  rate  of new  product  introductions.
Development  costs subsequent to achievement of  technological  feasibility have
not been significant during these periods and, accordingly,  all such costs have
been expensed as incurred. We expect product development expenses to continue to
approximate  18-20% of net  revenues as we continue to focus on new products and
technology.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative  expenses were $7.5
million,  $5.1  million and $4.4 million in 1998,  1997 and 1996,  respectively,
representing  increases  of 47% from  1997 to 1998  and 16%  from  1996 to 1997.
General and administrative  expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 11% in
1998 and 1997,  and 12% in 1996.  General and  administrative  expenses  consist
primarily of personnel costs for finance, administration, operations and general
management,

<PAGE>

as well as legal and  accounting  expenses.  The increase  from 1997 to 1998 and
from 1996 to 1997 was primarily  due to increased  staffing.  In addition,  from
1997 to 1998,  the cost of additional  leased  property to support the growth of
the company also contributed to the increase.

     PURCHASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER. In 1996, we incurred a charge
of $5.6 million in  connection  with the  write-off of  in-process  research and
development  due to the  acquisition  of Data  Exchange.  In May 1998, we issued
170,000  shares of common  stock for  certain  assets of the  Grants  Management
Division of Blackbaud,  Inc. and incurred a charge for  in-process  research and
development  and  other  expenses  of  $5.4  million  in  connection  with  this
transaction.  In November 1998, we incurred a charge for in-process research and
development of $3.0 million in connection  with the  acquisition of Hub Data. In
determining  the amount of in-process  research and  development,  we engaged an
independent  valuation firm to conduct an appraisal of the acquired assets.  The
intangible  assets  acquired,  including  in-process  research  and  development
expenses,  were valued based on estimates of future net cash flows discounted to
their present value at risk-adjusted rates of return.

     The in-process  research and development charge for Hub Data was determined
by  estimating  the net cash  flows  from the  sale of the  resulting  projects,
discounted  to net present value using a 25% discount rate and also assumed that
the project was approximately 61% complete.

     The Blackbaud  transaction  resulted in the  acquisition of certain assets,
but not an ongoing business.  The assets acquired included rights to Blackbaud's
32-bit in-process technology, access to certain Blackbaud source code to be used
in developing the new Advent products, a non-compete agreement and access to the
Blackbaud  customer  base.  The acquired  technology  was  purchased  for use in
Advent's  research  and  development  "grant  management"  project  and  had  no
alternative future use.

    In September 1998, the Chief Accountant of the SEC expressed  concerns about
the  methodologies  many  companies  were  using in  determining  the  amount of
in-process  research and  development.  A working group has been formed to study
this issue,  however at this time it is unknown what  guidelines this group will
generate and whether these  guidelines  will differ from the  valuation  methods
traditionally employed. The SEC's concerns appear to focus on excluding from the
valuations the costs of any efforts to complete  development  currently underway
and an  apportionment of cash flow estimates based on the stage of completion of
in-process  technology.  The  methodology  used to value the  intangible  assets
acquired in the Hub Data and  Blackbaud  transactions  took into  account  these
concerns  raised  by  the  SEC.  Accordingly,  we  believe  that  the  valuation
methodology used by the independent appraiser is appropriate.

INTEREST INCOME, NET

     Interest income was $1,442,000, $1,236,000 and $1,165,000 in 1998, 1997 and
1996,  respectively.  Interest income, net consists of interest income, interest
expense and miscellaneous  non-operating income and expense items. The increases
were due to greater  interest income generated in 1997 and 1998 from higher cash
and short-term investment balances.

INCOME TAXES

     We had  effective  tax rates of 40%,  37% and 163% in 1998,  1997 and 1996,
respectively.  The effective  tax rate in 1996  reflected the impact of the $5.6
million charge for in-process research and development, which was not deductible
for tax  purposes.  Excluding  the effect of the charge on the 1996 rate,  these
rates differ from the federal  statutory rate primarily due to state income tax,
offset by certain research and development credits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     We fund our operations  primarily from cash generated from operations.  Net
cash provided by operating  activities was $15.6 million,  $7.7 million and $1.6
million  in 1998,  1997 and  1996,  respectively.  Net  cash  used in  investing
activities  was $8.5 million,  $14.1 million and $5.6 million in 1998,  1997 and
1996,  respectively.  Included  in the 1998  amount  for cash used in  investing
activities  was $4.7  million  for the  acquisition  of Hub  Data and  Portfolio
Management  Systems.  The remaining  amounts were used for acquisitions of fixed
assets.  Net cash  provided by financing  activities  was $2.5 million for 1998,
primarily  from  proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our employee
stock purchase plan. As of December 31, 1998, we had $43.3 million in cash, cash
equivalents  and short-term  investments.  We believe that our existing cash and
cash equivalents,  short-term investments and cash expected to be generated from
operations will be sufficient to meet our cash and capital requirements at least
through fiscal 1999.

IMPACT OF YEAR 2000 ISSUE

     To the best of our knowledge,  the products we currently  license have been
designed to be and continue to be Year 2000 Compliant. Year 2000 Compliant means
that our products will  continue to operate  substantially  in  accordance  with
published  documentation  on and after  January  1, 2000.  However,  some of the
computer programs used in our internal operations may not be Year 2000 Compliant
as these  programs  rely on  time-sensitive  software that was written using two
digits  rather than four to identify the  applicable  year.  These  programs may
recognize  a date using "00" as the year 1900  rather  than the year 2000.  This
could  result in a system  failure or  miscalculations  causing  disruptions  of
operations,  including,  among other  things,  a temporary  inability to process
transactions, send invoices, or engage in similar normal business activities.

     We have  outlined a  four-stage  plan to comply  with Year 2000  processing
standards: assessment, renovation, validation and implementation. The assessment
phase  involves  identifying  the  problem,  identifying  all  systems  at risk,
prioritizing  and  developing   contingency  plans  and  identifying   potential
solutions and costs.  The renovation  phase  involves  applying the fixes to the
identified  problems and  re-evaluating  contingency  plans once fixes have been
made. The validation  phase requires  testing the fixes either by paper study or
by a dry run of  day-to-day  activities.  Implementation  is the final  phase in
which we identify  training needs,  establish a training plan and start training
people to properly  execute the contingency  plans. It is our intent to complete
this process by late 1999.

     We are currently in the assessment phase, having completed  identifying all
systems at risk.  Our next step is to evaluate  contingency  plans and  identify
potential  solutions and costs for all  identified  risks.  The necessity of any
contingency  plan  must be  evaluated  on a  case-by-case  basis  and will  vary
considerably in nature  depending on the Year 2000 issue it may need to address.
We found that two servers and  miscellaneous  software  need to be upgraded  and
phone switches need to be replaced at a cost of  approximately  $100,000.  Costs
for  replacing  most  software  have  been   insignificant  as  most  are  under
maintenance  contracts or under warranty.  To date, we have spent  approximately
$16,000 on  reallocation  of  personnel  resources  for the Year 2000 issue.  In
addition,   we  expect  to  reallocate  personnel   resources,   at  a  cost  of
approximately   $65,000,  to  attend  to  this  matter.  We  believe  any  other
modifications  deemed necessary will be made on a timely basis and estimate that
the cost of such  modifications will not have a material effect on our operating
results.

     Our expectation as to the extent and timeliness of  modifications  required
in order to achieve Year 2000 compliance is a forward-looking  statement subject
to risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may vary materially as a result of a
number of factors,  including,  among others, those described in this paragraph.
There  can be no  assurance  that we will be able to  successfully  modify  on a
timely  basis such  products,  services  and  systems  to comply  with Year 2000
requirements,  nor that our contingency  plans will prove effective in the event
that we fail  to  achieve  Year  2000  Compliance,  nor  that  the  cost of such
procedures  will  not  exceed  original  estimates,  any of which  could  have a
material  adverse  effect  on  our  operating  results.  Additionally,  we  have
initiated  communications  with third party  suppliers  of the major  computers,
software,  and other equipment used,  operated,  or maintained by us to identify
and, to the extent possible,  to resolve issues involving the Year 2000 problem.
However,  we have  limited or no control  over the  actions of these third party
suppliers.  Thus,  while  we  expect  that  they  will be able  to  resolve  any
significant  Year 2000  problems with these  systems,  there can be no assurance
that these  suppliers  will  resolve  any or all Year 2000  problems  with these
systems before the  occurrence of a material  disruption to the business of ours
or any of their  customers.  Any failure of these third  parties to resolve Year
2000  problems  with  their  systems  in a timely  manner  could have a material
adverse effect on our business,  financial condition, and results of operations.
Additionally,  during the next twelve  months there is likely to be an increased
customer focus on addressing Year 2000 issues,  creating the risk that customers
may  reallocate  capital  expenditures  to fix year 2000  problems  of  existing
systems and may also delay  implementation  of any new software  until  sometime
after January 1, 2000.  Although we have not  experienced  the effects of such a
trend to date, if customers  defer  purchases of our software  because of such a
reallocation, it could adversely effect our operating results.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In  June of  1998,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  133,   "Accounting   for  Derivative   Instruments  and  Hedging
Activities," which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments,  and for hedging  activities.  It requires that an entity recognize
all  derivatives  as either assets or  liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure those  instruments  at fair value.  Management  has not yet
evaluated the effects of this change on its  operations.  We will adopt SFAS No.
133 as required for our first quarterly filing of fiscal year 2000.

<PAGE>


     In December 1998,  the Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee  (AcSEC)
released  Statement of Position  98-9,  or SOP 98-9,  Modification  of SOP 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition," with Respect to Certain  Transactions.  SOP 98-9
amends SOP 97-2 to require that an entity recognize revenue for multiple element
arrangements by means of the "residual method" when (1) there is vendor-specific
objective  evidence  (VSOE) of the fair values of all the  undelivered  elements
that are not accounted for by means of long-term contract  accounting,  (2) VSOE
of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements,  and (3)
all revenue  recognition  criteria of SOP 97-2 (other than the  requirement  for
VSOE of the fair value of each delivered element) are satisfied.

     The  provisions of SOP 98-9 that extend the deferral of certain  paragraphs
of SOP 97-2 became effective December 15, 1998. These paragraphs of SOP 97-2 and
SOP 98-9 will be  effective  for  transactions  that are entered  into in fiscal
years beginning after March 15, 1999. Retroactive application is prohibited.  We
are evaluating the requirements of SOP 98-9 and the effects,  if any, on the our
current revenue recognition policies.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     The  discussion  in  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial
Condition  and  Results  of  Operations"   contains  trend  analysis  and  other
forward-looking   statements  that  are  based  on  current   expectations   and
assumptions  made  by  management.  Words  such  as  "expects",   "anticipates",
"intends",  "plans",  "believes",  "seeks",  "estimates", and variations of such
words and similar  expressions  are  intended to identify  such  forward-looking
statements.  These  statements  are not  guarantees  of future  performance  and
involve  certain  risks and  uncertainties,  which  are  difficult  to  predict.
Therefore,  actual  results  could  differ  materially  from those  expressed or
forecasted  in  the  forward-looking  statements  as a  result  of  the  factors
summarized  below and other risks  detailed  from time to time in reports  filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 1998 Annual Report to
Stockholders,   incorporated   by  reference  in  our  1998  Form  10-K  Report.
Additionally,  the  financial  statements  for  the  periods  presented  are not
necessarily  indicative of results to be expected for any future period, nor for
the entire year.

     We  operate in a rapidly  changing  environment  that  involves a number of
risks,  some of which are beyond our control.  These risks include the potential
for period to period fluctuations in operating results and the dependence on the
successful  development  and  market  acceptance  of new  products  and  product
enhancements  on a timely,  cost  effective  basis,  as well as the stability of
financial  markets,  maintenance of our  relationship  with Interactive Data and
price and product/performance  competition.  In particular, our net revenues and
operating results have varied substantially from period-to-period on a quarterly
basis and may  continue to  fluctuate  due to a number of factors.  Our software
products  typically  are  shipped  shortly  after  receipt  of a signed  license
agreement.  License backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents
only a small  portion of that  quarter's  expected  revenues.  In  addition,  as
licenses into multi-user networked environments increase both in individual size
and number, the timing and size of individual license  transactions are becoming
increasingly  important factors in our quarterly  operating  results.  The sales
cycles for these  transactions  are often  lengthy  and  unpredictable,  and the
ability to close large  license  transactions  on a timely basis or at all could
cause additional  variability in our quarterly  operating results.  In addition,
our results could be adversely  impacted by generic  issues  surrounding  market
volatility,  global economic  uncertainty and reductions in capital expenditures
by large  customers.  The target  clients  for our  products  include a range of
organizations that manage investment portfolios,  including investment advisors,
brokerage  firms,  banks and hedge funds. In addition,  we target  corporations,
public  funds,  universities  and  non-profit  organizations,  which also manage
investment  portfolios  and have many of the same needs.  The success of many of
our clients is intrinsically  linked to the health of the financial markets.  We
believe that demand for our  products  could be  disproportionately  affected by
fluctuations,  disruptions,  instability  or downturns in the financial  markets
which may cause  clients and  potential  clients to exit the  industry or delay,
cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment  management systems and
software products.

     Our future  success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new
products,  such as Moxy, Qube, and Geneva,  that address the future needs of our
target markets and to respond to emerging industry  standards and practices.  We
are directing a  significant  amount of our product  development  efforts to the
on-going  development  of  Geneva.  The  failure to  achieve  widespread  market
acceptance of Geneva on a timely basis would  adversely  affect our business and
operating  results.  To take  advantage  of the  Internet,  we have  launched an
Internet  initiative  whereby we are  developing  services,  both  announced and
unannounced, to bring Internet-based products and services to clients. The first
of these  services,  Rex, was launched  during the second  quarter of 1997.  The
second is the Advent Browser  Reporting  product which was launched in the third
quarter of 1998. As we begin  development of new products and services under the
Internet  initiative,  we have  and will  continue  to  enter  into  development
agreements with information  providers,  clients, or other companies in order to
accelerate the delivery of new products and services.  There can be no assurance
that we will be  successful in marketing  Rex,  Advent

Browser Reporting or in developing other Internet services. Our failure to do so
could adversely affect our business and operating results.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     OPERATIONS Advent provides stand-alone and client/server software products,
data interfaces and related  maintenance  and services that automate,  integrate
and support  certain  mission-critical  functions of the front,  middle and back
office  of   investment   management   organizations.   Advent's   clients  vary
significantly  in size  and  assets  under  management  and  include  investment
advisors,  brokerage  firms,  banks,  hedge funds,  corporations,  public funds,
foundations, universities and non-profit organizations.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated  financial  statements include
the  accounts  of Advent and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  All  intercompany
transactions and amounts have been eliminated.

     FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS Cash equivalents  comprise highly liquid investments
purchased with a remaining  maturity of 90 days or less.  These  investments are
maintained with major financial institutions.

     Short-term  investments  are  comprised  of various  marketable  securities
carried  at  cost.  These   investments  are  maintained  with  major  financial
institutions. Securities are considered to be held-to-maturity. Amounts reported
for short-term investments are considered to approximate the fair value based on
comparable market information available at the respective balance sheet dates.
Realized investment gains and losses have not been significant.

     The amounts reported for cash equivalents,  receivables,  accounts payable,
accrued   liabilities  and  other   financial   instruments  are  considered  to
approximate their market values based on comparable market information available
at the respective balance sheet dates, and their short-term nature.

     Financial  instruments that potentially subject Advent to concentrations of
credit risks comprise,  principally,  cash,  short-term  investments,  and trade
accounts receivable. Advent invests excess cash through banks, mutual funds, and
brokerage  houses   primarily  in  highly  liquid   investments  with  remaining
maturities of 90 days or less and has investment  policies and procedures  which
are  reviewed  periodically  to minimize  credit  risk.  Advent does not require
collateral  from its  customers  but performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations  and
maintains  reserves for  potential  credit losses which  historically  have been
within management's estimates.

     DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
related assets, generally five years.  Amortization of leasehold improvements is
computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
life of the assets or the remaining lease term.

     CAPITALIZED  SOFTWARE  Costs  incurred  for software  development  prior to
technological  feasibility  are  expensed  as product  development  costs in the
period  incurred.  Once  the  point of  technological  feasibility  is  reached,
production costs are capitalized.
Such capitalized software costs were not material in 1998, 1997 and 1996.

     REVENUE  RECOGNITION  Advent  licenses  application  software  programs and
offers annual  maintenance  programs  which  provides for technical  support and
updates to software products.  Advent's development agreements generally provide
for development of  technologies  and products which are expected to become part
of  Advent's  product  or  product  offerings  in the  future.  Certain of these
agreements may require  royalty  payments based on future sales of the developed
products.  Such  amounts  will be  included  in costs of goods sold as  accrued.
Advent also offers  customers  on-site  consulting  services,  training,  custom
programming, and other services.

     The Company  adopted the  provisions of Statement of Position  97-2, or SOP
97-2,  Software Revenue  Recognition,  as amended by Statement of Position 98-4,
Deferral of the  Effective  Date of Certain  Provisions  of SOP 97-2,  effective
January 1, 1998.  SOP 97-2  supersedes  Statement  of  Position  91-1,  Software
Revenue  Recognition,  and delineates  the  accounting for software  product and
maintenance revenue. Under SOP 97-2, the Company recognizes license revenue upon
shipment  of a product to the  client if a signed  contract  exists,  the fee is
fixed and determinable and collection of resulting receivables is probable.  For
contracts  with  multiple   obligations  (e.g.   deliverable  and  undeliverable
products, maintenance and other services), the Company allocates revenue to each
component of the contract based on objective  evidence of its fair value,  which
is specific to the Company, or for products not being sold separately, the price
established  by  management.   The  Company   recognizes  revenue  allocated  to
undelivered  products when the criteria for product  revenue set forth above are
met. The Company  recognizes  revenue  allocated to maintenance fees for ongoing
customer  support and product updates ratably 

<PAGE>


over the period of the maintenance  contract.  Payments for maintenance fees are
generally  made in advance and are  non-refundable.  Revenues for  interface and
other development and custom  programming are recognized using the percentage of
completion  method of  accounting  based on the costs  incurred to date compared
with the estimated cost of completion.  Revenues from professional  services are
recognized as work is performed.

      NET INCOME  (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic net income (loss) per share is computed
by dividing net income (loss)  available to common  stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for that period.  Diluted net income
(loss) per share is computed  giving  effect to all  dilutive  potential  common
shares  that were  outstanding  during the  period.  Dilutive  potential  shares
consist of incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and
warrants and conversion of preferred stock for all periods.

     RECLASSIFICATIONS In 1998, certain  reclassifications were made to the 1997
financial  statement  amounts  to  conform  to  the  1998  presentation.   These
reclassifications  had no impact on net income (loss),  working capital, or cash
flows.

    COMPREHENSIVE  INCOME  Advent has adopted the  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income",
effective   January  1,  1998.   This  statement   requires  the  disclosure  of
comprehensive  income  and  its  components  in a full  set  of  general-purpose
financial  statements.  Comprehensive  income  is  the  change  in  equity  from
transactions and other events and circumstances  other than those resulting from
investments  by owners and  distributions  to owners.  There are no  significant
components  of  comprehensive  income  excluded from net income;  therefore,  no
separate statement of comprehensive income has been presented.

     SEGMENT  INFORMATION  The Company has  adopted  SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1997. SFAS No. 131 supersedes SFAS No.
14,  "Financial  Reporting for Segments of a Business  Enterprise." SFAS No. 131
changes  current  practice under SFAS No. 14 by  establishing a new framework on
which  to  base  segment  reporting  and  introduces  requirements  for  interim
reporting of segment information.

     The  Company  has  determined  that  it  has a  single  reportable  segment
consisting  of  the   development,   marketing  and  sale  of  stand-alone   and
client/server  software  products,  data interfaces and related  maintenance and
services that automate, integrate and support certain mission critical functions
of investment management organizations.

     Management uses one measurement of profitability and does not disaggregate
its business for internal reporting.  The Company's international  operations in
1998, 1997 and 1996 have not been material to revenue or net income.

     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June of 1998, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting  Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities," which establishes  accounting and reporting  standards
for  derivative  instruments,  and for hedging  activities.  It requires that an
entity  recognize  all  derivatives  as  either  assets  or  liabilities  in the
statement of financial  position and measure  those  instruments  at fair value.
Management  has not yet evaluated the effects of this change on its  operations.
The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 as required for its first  quarterly  filing
of fiscal year 2000.

     In December 1998,  the Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee  (AcSEC)
released  Statement of Position  98-9,  or SOP 98-9,  Modification  of SOP 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition," with Respect to Certain  Transactions.  SOP 98-9
amends SOP 97-2 to require that an entity recognize revenue for multiple element
arrangements by means of the "residual method" when (1) there is vendor-specific
objective  evidence  (VSOE) of the fair values of all the  undelivered  elements
that are not accounted for by means of long-term contract  accounting,  (2) VSOE
of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements,  and (3)
all revenue  recognition  criteria of SOP 97-2 (other than the  requirement  for
VSOE of the fair value of each delivered element) are satisfied.

     The  provisions of SOP 98-9 that extend the deferral of certain  paragraphs
of SOP 97-2 became effective December 15, 1998. These paragraphs of SOP 97-2 and
SOP 98-9 will be  effective  for  transactions  that are entered  into in fiscal
years beginning after March 15, 1999. Retroactive application is prohibited. The
Company is evaluating the  requirements of SOP 98-9 and the effects,  if any, on
the Company's current revenue recognition policies.

     USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  the
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  

<PAGE>

expenses during the reporting  period.  These estimates are based on information
available  as of the date of the  financial  statements.  Actual  results  could
differ from those estimates.

    ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-LIVED  ASSETS The Company reviews  property,  equipment,
goodwill and other intangible  assets for impairment  whenever events or changes
in  circumstances  indicate  that the  carrying  amount  of an asset  may not be
recoverable.  Recoverability is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to
future net cash flows the assets are  expected to  generate.  If such assets are
considered  to be impaired,  the  impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying  amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
Intangibles are amortized over their estimated  useful lives  (typically five to
ten years).

    FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION  The  functional  currency  of the  Company's
foreign  subsidiary is the local foreign  currency.  All assets and  liabilities
denominated in foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange
rate on the balance sheet date.  Revenues,  costs and expenses are translated at
average rates of exchange prevailing during the period.  Translation adjustments
resulting  from  translation  of  intercompany  accounts  are  accumulated  as a
separate component of stockholders' equity and have not been significant.  Gains
and losses  resulting  from foreign  currency  transactions  are included in the
consolidated statements of operations and have not been significant.

2.  ACQUISITIONS

    In February  1996,  Advent  acquired Data Exchange,  Inc. (the DX Group),  a
private  company  based in New York,  for $4.0  million in cash and an  $800,000
note.  This  note was paid  during  the third  quarter  of 1996 and did not bear
interest.  The  transaction  was accounted for as a purchase.  Advent incurred a
one-time  charge of $5.6 million in connection  with the write-off of in-process
research and  development.  This expense was recorded in purchased  research and
development and other expenses.  We believe that the technology acquired had not
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use.

    In November  1996,  Advent  issued 35,000 shares of common stock in exchange
for all of the  outstanding  shares of Bold Software,  Inc., a private  software
development  company based in New York. This business  combination was accounted
for as a pooling of  interests.  Prior year  amounts  have not been  restated to
include  Bold   Software's   results  of  operations  as  such  operations  were
immaterial.  As a result of this business combination,  Advent introduced Advent
Partner,  a tax layering and partnership  allocation  solution which  integrates
with Axys.

    In February  1998,  Advent issued 250,000 shares of common stock in exchange
for all of the outstanding  shares of MicroEdge,  Inc.  MicroEdge is the leading
provider  of  software   products  to   foundations,   corporations   and  other
organizations to manage their grant-making activities. This business combination
was accounted  for as a pooling of  interests,  and the results of operations of
MicroEdge are included in the Company's financial  statements  beginning January
1, 1998.  The results of  operations  as well as the assets and  liabilities  of
MicroEdge,  in prior periods,  were not material to the consolidated  results of
operations  or financial  position of Advent.  Accordingly,  the Company did not
restate its financial statements for periods prior to January 1, 1998.

    In May 1998, Advent issued 170,000 shares of common stock for certain assets
of the Grants Management Division of Blackbaud,  Inc. This acquisition  combines
the grants management product line of Blackbaud with MicroEdge. This transaction
was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  are included in
the Company's  financial  statements  beginning on the acquisition  date. Advent
incurred a charge for in-process  research and development and other expenses of
$5.4 million in connection with this transaction. We believe that the technology
acquired had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use.  Other  intangibles  of $2.0 million were recorded in connection  with this
acquisition and are being amortized, using a straight-line method, over a period
of 5 years.

    In November 1998,  Advent issued 15,000 shares of common stock and paid $4.1
million in exchange for substantially all of the outstanding shares of Hub Data,
Inc.,  a  distributor  of  consolidated   securities  information  and  data  to
investment management  organizations.  Hub Data is located in Cambridge,  MA and
delivers  services to over 240  institutional  investment  firms.  This business
combination  was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of operations  for
Hub Data are included in the  Company's  financial  statements  beginning on the
acquisition  date.  Advent  incurred  a  charge  for  in-process   research  and
development  expense of $3.0 million in  connection  with this  transaction.  We
believe that the technology acquired had not reached  technological  feasibility
and had no alternative  future use. As a result of net  liabilities  assumed and
acquisition  expenses of $1.6 million,  goodwill of $3.2 million was recorded in
connection with this transaction and is being  amortized,  using a straight-line
method, over a period of 7 years.


<PAGE>

    In November 1998,  Advent paid AUS $583,000  (approximately  US $370,000) in
exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Portfolio Management Systems Pty.,
Ltd., a distributor of Advent products in Australia.  This business  combination
was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  are included in
the  Company's  financial  statements  beginning on the  acquisition  date. As a
result of net  liabilities  assumed and  acquisition  expenses of $2.0  million,
goodwill of $2.4 million was recorded in connection with this transaction and is
being  amortized,  using a  straight-line  method,  over a period  of 10  years.
Subsequent to the acquisition, the name of this subsidiary was changed to Advent
Australia.

    The results of operations of  Blackbaud,  Hub Data and Portfolio  Management
Systems  in 1998 and 1997  were not  material  to the  consolidated  results  of
operations of Advent. Accordingly, no pro forma results are presented.

contributions  by Advent  in 1998,  1997 and 1996 were  $117,000,  $103,000  and
$73,000, respectively. In addition to the employer matching contribution, Advent

     1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     All  individuals  employed  by Advent are  eligible to  participate  in the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase  Plan) if they are employed by Advent for
at least 20 hours per week and at least five months per year.  The Purchase Plan
permits  eligible  employees to purchase  Advent's  common stock through payroll
deductions  at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the  closing  sale price for
Advent's  common stock reported on the Nasdaq  National  Market at the beginning
and the end of each six-month  offering period.  In any calendar year,  eligible
employees  can  withhold  up  to  10%  of  their  salary  and  certain  variable
compensation.  A total of 300,000  shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance  under the  Purchase  Plan of which  129,000  shares have been  issued.
Approximately,  38,000,  38,000 and 53,000 shares were sold through the Purchase
Plan in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

     Stock Options

     Under  Advent's  1992  Stock Plan (the  Plan)  Advent may grant  options to
purchase  common  stock to employees  and  consultants.  Options  granted may be
incentive stock options or nonstatutory  stock options and shall be granted at a
price not less than fair market  value on the date of grant.  Fair market  value
(as defined in the Plan) and the vesting of these options shall be determined by
the Board of Directors.  The options  generally  vest over 5 years and expire no
later than 10 years from the date of grant.  Unvested  options on termination of
employment are canceled and returned to the Plan.

Stock Option Plan  ("Nonstatutory  Plan") and reserved  100,000 shares of common
stock for issuance thereunder. Under Advent's 1998 Nonstatutory Plan, Advent may
grant options to purchase common stock to employees and  consultants,  excluding
persons  who  are  executive   officers  and  directors.   Options  granted  are
nonstatutory  stock  options  and shall be granted at a price not less than fair

Of the 92,000 options under the  Nonstatutory  Plan  outstanding at December 31,
1998, none were exercisable.

     In  addition  to the Plan and the  Nonstatutory  Plan,  Advent had  granted
options to purchase  common  stock to  employees or  consultants  under  special
arrangements.  These  options have an exercise  price of $1.00 per share.  There
were 7,000, 10,000 and 12,000 of these options outstanding at December 31, 1998,
1997 and  1996,  respectively.  The  change in each  period  was a result of the
exercise  of  3,000,  2,000  and  4,000  options  during  1998,  1997 and  1996,
respectively. The shares outstanding at December 31, 1998 are fully vested.

     Advent's 1995 Director  Option Plan (the  Director  Plan)  provides for the
grant of nonstatutory stock options to non-employee directors of Advent (Outside
Directors).  Under  the  Director  Plan,  each  Outside  Director  is  granted a
non-qualified  option to purchase 10,000 shares on the last to occur of the date
of  effectiveness  of the Director Plan or the date upon which such person first
becomes a director  with an exercise  price  equal to the fair  market  value of
Advent's  common stock as of the date of the grant.  In subsequent  years,  each
Outside Director is automatically  granted an option to purchase 2,000 shares on
December 1 with an exercise  price  equal to the fair value of  Advent's  common
stock on that date.  Options  granted  under the Director  Plan vest over a five
year period and have a ten year term.

     In addition to the Director Plan, Advent granted options, prior to 1994, to
an Outside  Director for the  purchase of 96,000  shares of common stock with an
exercise price of $0.63 per share. These options were exercised during 1996.

     Such pro forma disclosures may not be representative of future compensation
costs  because  options vest over several years and  additional  grants are made
each year.

     The weighted-average  grant-date fair value of options granted were $16.81,
$14.50 and $14.50 per option for the years ended  December  31,  1998,  1997 and
1996, respectively.

     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the   Black-Scholes   valuation  model  with  the  following   weighted  average
assumptions:


                               1998             1997             1996
                          ---------------   ---------------  ----------------
Risk-free interest rate        4.9%             5.99%             6.03%
Volatility                     60.4             56.91             55.04
Expected life                5 years           5 years           5 years
Expected dividends             None              None             None
Average turnover rate           8%                8%               8%


     The  risk-free  interest rate was  calculated in accordance  with the grant
date and expected life. Volatility was calculated using an analysis of an Advent
peer group of publicly traded companies.  The weighted average expected life was
calculated  based  on the  vesting  period  and  the  exercise  behavior  of the
participants.

     The fair  value for the  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  rights  were also
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes  options pricing model with
the following  assumptions for 1998, 1997 and 1996:  risk-free interest rates of
4.9%, 5.99% and 6.03%, respectively; dividend yield of 0%; volatility factors of
60%, 57% and 55% for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively; and a six-month expected
life. The weighted  average fair value of the ESPP rights granted in 1998,  1997
and 1996 was $9.61, $8.96 and $9.84, respectively.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Advent Software, Inc.:

    In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated  statements  of  operations,  stockholders'  equity  and cash flows
present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Advent
Software,  Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997,
and the results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended  December  31,  1998,  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted   accounting   principles.   These   financial   statements   are   the
responsibility of the Company's management;  our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audit.  We  conducted  our
audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Dear Advent Shareholders,


Advent's 2000 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders  will be held on Thursday,  May 4,
2000 at 10:00 am at our corporate  offices,  located at 301 Brannan Street,  San
Francisco,  California 94107. We look forward to your attending either in person
or by proxy.  The Notice of Annual  Meeting,  the Proxy  Statement and the Proxy
Card from the Board of Directors are enclosed.  These materials  provide further
information concerning the Annual Meeting.

Since our last Annual  Meeting we have split our stock  twice,  a  three-for-two
stock  split in August 1999 and a two-for-one split in March  2000.  These stock
splits had the effect of using a significant  majority of our authorized  Common
Stock  since stock  splits are  effected  in the form of share  dividends  under
Delaware  Corporate law.  Therefore,  we are proposing to increase the number of
authorized  shares.  The share  increase  will  reestablish  the  proportion  of
authorized  shares to issued shares that existed prior to our stock splits.  The
Board of  Directors  recommends  that you vote FOR the increase in the number of
authorized shares of Common Stock.

Another  item for  consideration  at our Annual  Meeting is an  increase  in the
number of shares  available under our Directors'  Option Plan. As we continue to
grow and expand our  operations  we may also  expand our board of  directors  by
adding  individuals who have relevant industry  experience.  This share increase
will give us the ability to attract  high quality  industry  experts to join our
board and to retain our current board  members.  This proposal does not increase
the actual grant given to each director.  The Board of Directors recommends that
you  vote FOR the  increase  in the  shares  reserved  for  issuance  under  the
Directors' Option Plan.

The final two agenda  items at this  year's  Annual  Meeting  include the annual
election of directors and the annual  proposal to ratify the  appointment of our
independent  auditing firm. The Board of Directors  recommends that you vote FOR
the election of the slate of nominees for directors and FOR  ratification of the
appointment of the independent auditors.

Sincerely yours,



Irv H. Lichtenwald
Secretary

4.       To ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as  independent

                                 PROXY STATEMENT
                       FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

                               PROCEDURAL MATTERS

GENERAL

     The enclosed  Proxy is solicited on behalf of Advent  Software,  Inc.  (the
"Company") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Thursday,
May 4, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., local time, and at any adjournment  thereof,  for the
purposes set forth herein and in the  accompanying  Notice of Annual  Meeting of
Stockholders.

     The Annual Meeting will be held at the Company's  corporate  offices at 301
Brannan Street, San Francisco,  California 94107. The Company's telephone number
is (415) 543-7696.

     These proxy  solicitation  materials were mailed on or about April 4, 2000,
together  with  the  Company's  1999  Annual  Report  to  Stockholders,  to  all
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.

     Advent's  Board of Directors  approved a  three-for-two  stock split of the
Company's Common Stock paid in August 1999 and a two-for-one  stock split of the
Company's  Common Stock paid in March 2000. Both stock splits were effected as a
stock dividend.  All shares and per share data in this proxy statement have been
adjusted to reflect both stock dividends.

RECORD DATE

     Stockholders  of  record at the close of  business  on March 15,  2000 (the
"Record Date") are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual  Meeting.  As
of the Record Date,  approximately  29.6 million shares of the Company's  common
stock,  $.01 par value (the "Common Stock"),  were issued and  outstanding.  For
information  regarding  security  ownership by management  and by the beneficial
owners of more than 5% of the Company's Common Stock,  see "Beneficial  Security
Ownership of Management and Certain Beneficial Owners."

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     Any proxy given pursuant to this  solicitation may be revoked by the person
giving it at any time  before  its use by  delivering  to the  Secretary  of the
Company a written  notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later
date or by attending the meeting and voting in person.

VOTING AND SOLICITATION

     Each  stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock on
all matters presented at the Annual Meeting.  Stockholders do not have the right
to cumulate their votes in the election of directors.

     The cost of soliciting  proxies will be borne by the Company.  In addition,
the  Company  may  reimburse  brokerage  firms  and other  persons  representing
beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in


                                       2
<PAGE>


forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be
solicited by certain of the Company's directors, officers and regular employees,
without additional compensation,  personally or by telephone,  telegram, letter,
electronic mail, or facsimile.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS; BROKER NON-VOTES

     The  presence,  in person or by proxy,  of the holders of a majority of the
shares  entitled to be voted at the Annual  Meeting is necessary to constitute a
quorum at the Annual Meeting. A plurality of the votes duly cast is required for
the election of directors.  The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes duly
cast is required to amend the Director Option Plan and to ratify the appointment
of auditors.  The affirmative  vote of the outstanding  stock of the corporation
entitled  to  vote on the  matter  is  required  to  amend  the  Certificate  of
Incorporation.

     Under the General  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,  an abstaining
vote and broker  "non-vote" are counted as present and entitled to vote and are,
therefore,  included for the purposes of determining  whether a quorum of shares
is present at a meeting.  Neither  abstentions nor broker "non-votes" effect the
election of  directors  as the votes  required is a plurality  of the votes duly
cast. Abstaining votes and broker "non-votes" are not deemed to be "votes cast."
As a result,  while  abstentions are deemed to be "votes cast" and will have the
effect of votes in opposition of any given proposal,  broker "non-votes" are not
included  in the  tabulation  of the  voting  results  on issues  requiring  the
approval of a majority of the votes cast.  They therefore do not have the effect
of votes in opposition in such tabulations. However in the case of the amendment
of the  Certificate  of  Incorporation,  broker  "non-votes"  will have the same
effect  as  votes  against  the  proposal  since  the  affirmative  vote  of the
outstanding stock of the corporation  entitled to vote on the matter is required
to amend the Certificate of Incorporation.

     A broker  "non-vote"  occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial
owner does not vote on a particular  proposal  because the nominee does not have
discretionary  voting  power  with  respect  to that  item and has not  received
instructions from the beneficial owner.

DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Proposals of stockholders of the Company which are intended to be presented
by such  stockholders at the Company's 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders  must
be  received  by the  Company  no later  than  December  5,  2000 in order to be
considered  for inclusion in the proxy  statement and form of proxy  relating to
that meeting.

                                 PROPOSAL NO. 1

                              ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

NOMINEES

     The Company's  Bylaws  authorize a Board of six  directors.  A board of six
directors is to be elected at the Annual Meeting.  Unless otherwise  instructed,
the proxy  holders will vote the proxies  received by them for the Company's six
nominees named below.  In the event that any nominee of the Company is unable or
declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual  Meeting,  the proxies
will be voted for any nominee who shall be  designated  by the present  Board of
Directors  to fill the  vacancy.  It is not  expected  that any nominee  will be
unable or will decline to serve as a director. The term of office of each person
elected  as  a  director  will  continue   until  the  next  Annual  Meeting  of
Stockholders or until a successor has been elected and qualified.

BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES

     The Board of Directors  held a total of six meetings  (including  regularly
scheduled and special meetings) during fiscal 1999. No incumbent director during
the last fiscal year,  while a member of the Board of Directors,  attended fewer
than 75% of (i) the total  number of meetings of the Board of  Directors or (ii)
the total  number of  meetings  held by all  committees  on which such  director
served.

     The Board of Directors of the Company has two standing committees: an Audit
Committee and a Compensation  Committee. It does not have a nominating committee
or a committee performing the functions of a nominating committee.

     The Audit  Committee,  which currently  consists of Messrs.  Zuendt and Van
Auken,  is  responsible  for  (i)  recommending   engagement  of  the  Company's
independent  auditors,  (ii) approving the services  performed by such auditors,
(iii) consulting with such auditors and reviewing with them the results of their
examination, (iv) reviewing and approving any material accounting policy changes
affecting the Company's  operating results,  (v) reviewing the Company's control
procedures  and  personnel,  and (vi)  reviewing  and  evaluating  the Company's
accounting principles and its system of internal accounting controls.  The Audit
Committee held one meeting during fiscal 1999.

     The Compensation  Committee,  which currently consists of Messrs.  Robinson
and Zweben,  is responsible for (i) reviewing and approving the compensation and
benefits for the Company's officers and other employees,  (ii) administering the
Company's   stock   purchase   and  stock   option   plans,   and  (iii)  making
recommendations  to  the  Board  of  Directors   regarding  such  matters.   The
Compensation Committee held one meeting during fiscal 1999.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     Directors  who are  employees  of the  Company  do not  receive  additional
compensation   for  their  services  as  directors  of  the  Company.   However,
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors receive an annual cash retainer of
$5,000 and $1,250 for  attendance  at each  meeting of the Board of Directors or
any committee thereof.

     In  addition,  nonemployee  directors  participate  in the  Company's  1995
Director  Option Plan (the "Director  Plan").  The Director Plan was approved by
the Board in October 1995 and was ratified by  stockholders in November 1995, at
which time a total of 225,000  shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance
thereunder.  As of March 15, 2000, there were 192,000 options  outstanding under
the  Director  Plan.  The  Director  Plan  became  effective  on the date of the
Company's  initial  public  offering  on November  15,  1995,  and is  currently
administered  by  the  Board  of  Directors.   Under  the  Director  Plan,  each
nonemployee director is automatically granted a non-qualified option to purchase
30,000  shares on the date upon which such person first  becomes a director (the
"Initial  Option") with an exercise  price equal to the fair market value of the
Company's  Common Stock as of the date of grant.  Thereafter,  each  nonemployee
director is  automatically  granted an option to purchase 6,000 shares of Common
Stock on December  1st of each year,  except in the year the  Director  Plan was
adopted ("Subsequent  Option"),  provided he or she has served as a director for
at least six months as of such date.

     Options  granted  under the  Director  Plan have a term of ten years unless
terminated  sooner upon  termination of the  optionee's  status as a director or
otherwise  pursuant to the Director Plan.  Such options are  transferable by the
optionee only in certain  limited  circumstances  and each option is exercisable
during  the  lifetime  of the  director  only by such  director  or a  permitted
transferee. Initial Options granted under the Director Plan vest as to one-fifth
(1/5)  of the  shares  on the  first  anniversary  date of  grant  and as to the
remaining  shares,  ratably each month over the ensuing  four years.  Subsequent
Options  begin to


                                       5
<PAGE>


vest on the fourth  anniversary of the date of grant and vest ratably each month
over  the  next  12  month  period.  The  Director  Plan  is  designed  to  work
automatically, without administration;  however, to the extent administration is
necessary,  the Director  Plan has been  structured  so that options  granted to
non-employee directors who administer the Company's other employee benefit plans
shall qualify as  transactions  exempt from Section 16(b) of the  Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Exchange  Act"),  pursuant to Rule 16b-3
promulgated thereunder.

REQUIRED VOTE

     The six nominees  receiving the highest number of affirmative  votes of the
shares present or represented and entitled to be voted for them shall be elected
as directors, whether or not such affirmative votes constitute a majority of the
shares  voted.  Votes  withheld  from any  director  are counted for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business,
but they have no legal effect under Delaware law.

           MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE NOMINEES LISTED ABOVE.


                                 PROPOSAL NO. 2

            APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
           TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

     The Board of Directors has  determined  that it is in the best interests of
the  Company  and  its  stockholders  to  amend  the  Company's  Certificate  of
Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the
Company from 40,000,000 to 120,000,000 (the "Amendment"). Accordingly, the Board
of Directors has  unanimously  approved the  Amendment  and hereby  solicits the
approval of the Company's  stockholders  of the  Amendment.  If the Amendment is
adopted  by  the  stockholders,  it  will  become  effective  upon  filing  of a
Certificate  of Amendment  of the  Company's  Certificate  of  Incorporation  in
substantially the form attached hereto Exhibit A, with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware.

     As of March 15,  2000,  the  Company  has 40 million  authorized  shares of
Common Stock. Of this authorized number,  approximately 29.6 million shares were
outstanding  and  approximately  8.8 million  shares were  reserved for issuance
under the Company's equity compensation plans, leaving approximately 1.6 million
shares unreserved, unissued and available for issuance.

PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE AMENDMENT

     The  principal  purpose of the proposal to authorize  additional  shares of
Common  Stock is to provide the Company  with the  flexibility  to issue  Common
Stock for a variety of proper  corporate  purposes  which the Board of Directors
may deem advisable without further action by the Company's stockholders,  except
as may be required by law,  regulation or Nasdaq rule.  These purposes  include,
among other  things,  declaring  stock splits in the form of stock  dividends or
distributions,  raising equity capital,  adopting  additional  equity  incentive
plans or reserving  additional  shares for issuance  under such plans and making
acquisitions  through the use of stock. The availability of additional shares of
Common Stock is particularly  important in the event that the Board of Directors
needs to undertake any of the foregoing  actions on an expedited  basis and thus
avoid the time and expense of seeking  stockholder  approval in connection  with
the contemplated action. As a result of the Company's  three-for-two stock split
paid in August 1999 and two-for-one  stock split paid in March 2000, the company
increased  its  outstanding  common  Stock  by 300%  without  any  proportionate
increase in the number of authorized

                                       6
<PAGE>

shares. Accordingly, another purpose of the proposed amendment is to establish a
ratio of authorized  shares to issued shares that more closely  approximates the
ratio that existed  prior to the stock  splits.  The Board of  Directors  has no
present  agreement,  arrangement  or  intention  to issue any of the  additional
shares for which approval is sought. However, if these situations were to arise,
the issuance of additional  shares of Common Stock could have a dilutive  effect
on  earnings  per  share  and a  stockholder's  percentage  voting  power in the
Company.

     The  increase in the  authorized  number of shares of Common  Stock and the
subsequent issuance of such shares could, under certain circumstances,  have the
effect of delaying  or  preventing  a change in control of the  Company  without
further action by the stockholders (for example, by diluting the stock ownership
of a person  seeking  to  effect a change  in the  composition  of the  Board of
Directors or  contemplating a tender offer).  The Company is not presently aware
of any  pending or  proposed  transaction  involving  a change in control of the
Company.  While it may be deemed to have potential  anti-takeover  effects,  the
proposed  amendment to increase the  authorized  Common Stock is not prompted by
any specific effort or takeover threat currently perceived by management.

VOTE REQUIRED

     The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of the Common Stock will be required to approve this  Amendment to the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation. As a result, abstentions and broker non-votes will
have the same effect as negative votes.

             THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS
                   VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT OF THE
                     COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION.


                                 PROPOSAL NO. 3

        APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT OF THE COMPANY'S 1995 DIRECTOR OPTION PLAN

     The Company's 1995 Director Option Plan (the "Directors' Plan") was adopted
by the Board of Directors in September 1995 and was approved by the stockholders
in November  1995.  A total of 425,000  shares of Common  Stock are reserved for
issuance  under  the  Directors'  Plan,   including  the  shares  submitted  for
stockholder  approval at this meeting. As of March 15, 2000, options to purchase
192,000 shares of Common Stock had been granted under the  Directors'  Plan at a
weighted  average per share exercise price of $10.84 and 233,000 shares remained
available for future grants under the Directors'  Plan. There are currently four
directors who are eligible to participate in the Directors' Plan.

     The  stockholders  are requested to approve an amendment to the  Directors'
Plan to  increase  the number of shares  reserved  for  issuance  thereunder  by
200,000 for a total of 425,000 shares.  The Company  believes that these changes
will serve to better  align the  interests  of the  directors  with those of the
stockholders,  facilitate  attracting  highly  qualified  directors and simplify
administration  of the Directors' Plan. The Directors' Plan was adopted in order
to permit equity  participation in the Company by the non-employee  directors of
the Company as  consideration  for their  service on the Board and to provide an
equity incentive associated with the success of the Company's business.

SUMMARY OF THE DIRECTORS' PLAN

A description  of the  principal  features of the  Directors'  Plan is set forth
below.

     PURPOSE.  The purposes of the Directors' Plan are to attract and retain the
best  available  personnel  for service as directors of the Company,  to provide
additional  incentive to the  non-employee  directors of the Company to serve as
directors and to encourage their continued service on the Board.

     STOCK  SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.  The maximum  number of shares of the Company's
Common Stock that may be optioned and sold under the Directors' Plan is 425,000,
including  the shares  submitted  for  approval  at this  meeting.  If an option
expires or becomes unexercisable for any reason, the unpurchased shares of stock
that were subject to the option may be returned to the Directors'  Plan,  unless
such plan has  terminated,  and may become  available for future grant under the
plan.

     ADMINISTRATION.  The  Directors'  Plan fixes the  timing of option  grants,
amount of the grants,  basis for the exercise price and restrictions on exercise
of the  options  in order to remove  any  discretionary  element  from the plan.
Administration of the Directors' Plan, to the extent necessary, will be provided
by the Board of Directors of the Company.  The plan is  structured  such that no
discretion is exercised by any person concerning  material  decisions  regarding
the Directors' Plan.

     ELIGIBILITY.  The  Directors'  Plan  provides  for the  automatic  grant of
nonstatutory options to outside directors of the Company.  Upon being elected or
appointed to the Company's Board of Directors,  each outside director is granted
an option,  subject to certain vesting provisions,  to purchase 30,000 shares of
the Company's Common Stock (the "Initial Option").  Thereafter,  if the proposed
amendment is approved,  each outside director who has served on the Board for at
least six full months prior to the date of grant shall be automatically granted,
on December 1 of each year, an option to purchase  6,000 shares of the Company's
Common Stock (the "Subsequent  Option").  New Directors who join the Board after
June 1 but prior to December 1 of a given year shall receive no annual option in
that year.

     TERM OF PLAN.  The  Directors'  Plan shall be effective for a ten-year term
unless earlier terminated pursuant to the provisions of the plan.

     TERMS OF OPTION;  OPTION  AGREEMENT.  Options  granted under the Directors'
Plan  have  a  term  of ten  years,  unless  otherwise  provided  in the  option
agreement.  Each option is  evidenced by a stock  option  agreement  between the
Company and the director to whom such option is granted.

     EXERCISE  PRICE.  The per share exercise price of each option granted under
the Directors'  Plan is equal to the fair market value per share on the date the
option is granted.  As long as the Common  Stock of the Company is traded on the
Nasdaq National Market,  the fair market value of a share of Common Stock of the
Company shall be the closing sales price for such stock on the date of grant.

     EXERCISE OF OPTION. The  director-optionee  must earn the right to exercise
the option by  continuing  to serve on the Board of  Directors.  Options  become
exercisable  cumulatively,   as  follows:  Initial  Options  granted  under  the
Director's  Plan vest  one-fifth  (1/5) on the first  anniversary of the date of
grant and one-sixtieth  (1/60) of the shares subject to the option at the end of
each month thereafter. Subsequent Options granted under the Director's Plan vest
one-twelfth  (1/12) on the fourth anniversary and one month of the date of grant
and  one-twelfth  (1/12) of the shares  subject to the option at the end of each
month thereafter.


                                       8
<PAGE>


     An option is  exercised  by giving  written  notice of the  exercise to the
Company specifying the number of full shares of Common Stock to be purchased and
tendering payment of the purchase price to the Company.

     FORM OF  CONSIDERATION.  The  consideration to be paid for the shares to be
issued upon exercise of an option under the Directors' Plan may consist of cash,
check,  net exercise or other shares of the Company's Common Stock which, in the
case of the shares acquired upon exercise of an option,  have been  beneficially
owned for at least six months or which were not acquired  directly or indirectly
from the Company,  with a fair market  value on the  exercise  date equal to the
aggregate exercise price of the shares being purchased.

     RULE 16B-3.  Options  granted to directors  must comply with the applicable
provisions  of Rule  16b-3 or any  successor  thereto  and  shall  contain  such
additional  conditions or restrictions as may be required  thereunder to qualify
for the maximum  exemption  from  Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to
Directors' Plan actions.

     TERMINATION OF STATUS AS A DIRECTOR.  If a non-employee  director ceases to
serve as a director of the Company,  options  outstanding  under the  Directors'
Plan may be  exercised,  if the proposed  amendment  is  approved,  within three
months  after he or she  ceases to serve as a  director  of the  Company  to the
extent such options were exercisable on the date of termination.

     DISABILITY.  If a  non-employee  director  ceases  to serve on the Board of
Directors due to a total and permanent disability, options outstanding under the
Directors'  Plan may be  exercised  within 12 months  after  termination  to the
extent that such options were exercisable at the date of termination.

     DEATH OF OPTIONEE.  If a director-optionee  should die while serving on the
Company's  Board of  Directors,  options may be  exercised at any time within 12
months after death,  but only to the extent the options were  exercisable at the
date of death.

     TERMINATION  OF OPTIONS.  No option is  exercisable by any person after the
expiration of ten years from the date the option was granted.

     Nontransferability.   An  option  granted  under  the  Directors'  Plan  is
nontransferable  by the holder otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution,  and is  exercisable  during  the  holder's  lifetime  only by the
optionee,  or in the event of the optionee's  death, by the optionee's estate or
by a person  who  acquires  the  right to  exercise  the  option by  bequest  or
inheritance.

     ADJUSTMENT  UPON  CHANGES IN  CAPITALIZATION  OR  MERGER.  In the event any
change is made in the Company's capitalization, such as a stock split or reverse
stock split,  appropriate  adjustment shall be made to the purchase price and to
the number of shares  subject to the stock option.  In the event of the proposed
dissolution  or   liquidation  of  the  Company,   all  options  will  terminate
immediately prior to the consummation of such actions, unless otherwise provided
by the Board. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the
assets  of the  Company,  or the  merger  of the  Company  with or into  another
corporation,  the outstanding options shall become fully vested and exercisable,
including as to shares for which such option would otherwise be exercisable, for
a period of thirty (30) days, after which the option shall terminate.

     AMENDMENT  AND  TERMINATION  OF  DIRECTOR'S  PLAN.  The  Board may amend or
terminate  the  Directors'  Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board
may deem advisable;  provided that, to the extent  necessary to comply with Rule
16b-3  promulgated  under  the  Exchange  Act  or  any  other  successor  law or
regulation,  the Company shall obtain  stockholder  approval of any amendment to
the Directors'


                                       9
<PAGE>

Plan in such a manner and to such a degree as is required by the applicable law,
rule or regulation.  Any amendment or  termination of the Directors'  Plan shall
not affect options  already  granted and such options shall remain in full force
and effect as if the Directors' Plan had not been amended or terminated, without
the  director-optionee's  consent.  Any provisions of the  Directors'  Plan that
affect  terms  required to be  specified  in the plan by Rule 16b-3  promulgated
under the  Exchange  Act shall not be amended  more than once every six  months,
other than as required by other applicable laws, rules or regulations.

FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

     The  following  is only a summary  of the  effect  of  federal  income  tax
consequences  of  transactions  under the Directors'  Plan.  This summary is not
intended  to be  exhaustive,  and does not  discuss  the tax  consequences  of a
participant's death or the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign
country in which an optionee may reside.

     Options granted under the Directors' Plan are  nonstatutory  stock options.
An  optionee  will not  recognize  any  taxable  income at the time he or she is
granted a nonstatutory  stock option.  Upon exercise of the option, the optionee
will generally  recognize  compensation income for federal tax purposes measured
by the  excess,  if any,  of the then fair  market  value of the shares over the
option  price.  Because the  optionee is a director of the  Company,  in certain
limited  circumstances  the date of  taxation  (and the date of  measurement  of
taxable  ordinary  income) may be deferred unless the optionee files an election
under Section 83(b) of the Code within thirty days of the date of exercise. Upon
resale of such shares by the optionee,  any  difference  between the sales price
and the exercise price,  to the extent not recognized as compensation  income as
provided  above,  will be treated as capital gain or loss,  and will qualify for
long-term  capital gain or loss  treatment if the shares have been held for more
than one year. The Company will be entitled to a tax deduction in the amount and
at the time that the optionee  recognizes ordinary income with respect to shares
acquired upon exercise of a nonstatutory option.

REQUIRED VOTE

         The approval of the amendment to the Director  Option Plan requires the
affirmative  vote of a majority of the Votes Cast on the  proposal at the Annual
Meeting.  The effect of an abstention is the same as a vote against the approval
of the amendment of the 1995 Directors' Option Plan.

THE COMPANY'S  BOARD OF DIRECTORS  RECOMMENDS THAT  STOCKHOLDERS  VOTE "FOR" THE
AMENDMENT  TO THE  DIRECTORS'  OPTION  PLAN TO  INCREASE  THE  NUMBER  OF SHARES
                       RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE THEREUNDER.



                                 PROPOSAL NO. 4

             RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

     The Board of Directors has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
accountants,  to audit the  financial  statements  of the Company for the fiscal
year  ending  December  31,  2000.  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP has  audited the
Company's    financial    statements   since   1989.   A    representative    of
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP is  expected  to be present at the  meeting and will
have the  opportunity  to make a  statement,  and is expected to be available to
respond to appropriate questions.

REQUIRED VOTE

         The Board of Directors has conditioned its appointment of the Company's
independent  accountants  upon the receipt of the affirmative vote of a majority
of the  shares  represented,  in person or by proxy,  and  voting at the  Annual
Meeting,  which shares voting  affirmatively also constitute at least a majority
of the required  quorum.  In the event that the  stockholders do not approve the
selection of  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, the  appointment  of the  independent
accountants will be reconsidered by the Board of Directors.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHTOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION
OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AS INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS FOR
                     FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2000.

      as to which the  individual  has sole or shared voting power or investment
      power and also any shares  which the  individual  has the right to acquire
      within  sixty days of March 15,  2000  through  the  exercise of any stock
      option or other right. Unless otherwise  indicated in the footnotes,  each
      person has sole voting and  investment  power (or shares such powers) with
      respect to the shares shown as beneficially owned.

                COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act ("Section  16(a)") requires the Company's
officers  and  directors,  and  persons  who own  more  than  ten  percent  of a
registered  class  of the  Company's  equity  securities,  to  file  reports  of
ownership  on Form 3 and  changes  in  ownership  on  Form 4 or Form 5 with  the
Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") and the National  Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Such officers,  directors and ten-percent  stockholders
are also  required by SEC rules to furnish  the Company  with copies of all such
forms that they file.

     Based  solely on its  review of the copies of such  forms  received  by the
Company,  or written  representations  from certain  reporting  persons that all
Forms 5 required for such persons were filed,  the Company  believes that during
fiscal 1999 all Section  16(a) filing  requirements  applicable to its officers,
directors and ten-percent stockholders were complied with.

           COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     The  Company's  Compensation  Committee  was formed in October  1995 and is
currently composed of Messrs. Zweben and Robinson. No interlocking  relationship
exists  between any member of the Company's  Board of Directors or  Compensation
Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation  committee of
any other Company,  nor has any such  interlocking  relationship  existed in the
past. No member of the  Compensation  Committee is or was formerly an officer or
an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries.

     During 1997 and 1998,  Mr.  Frank H.  Robinson,  a director of the Company,
served  as  a  consultant  to  the  Company  and  was  paid  $32,000  and  $890,
respectively,  in consulting fees for his services.  No consulting services were
performed by him in 1999.

     The Company has entered into  indemnification  agreements  with each of its
directors and officers.  Such  agreements  require the Company to indemnify such
individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law.

(4)   Potential realizable value assumes that the stock price increases from the
      exercise price from the date of grant until the end of the option term (10
      years) at the  annual  rate  specified  (5% and 10%).  Annual  compounding
      results in total appreciation of approximately  62.9% (at 5% per year) and
      159.4% (at 10% per year).  The assumed  annual rates of  appreciation  are
      specified  in SEC rules and do not  represent  the  Company's  estimate or
      projection of future stock price growth.  The Company does not necessarily
      agree that this method can properly determine the value of an option.

         REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The  Compensation  Committee  of the Board of Directors  (the  "Committee")
consists of directors Monte F. Zweben and Frank H. Robinson,  neither of whom is
an employee or officer of the Company. The Committee sets policy and administers
the Company's cash and equity  incentive  programs for the purpose of attracting
and retaining highly skilled  executives who will promote the Company's business
goals and build long-term  stockholder  value. The Committee is also responsible
for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding all
forms of compensation to be provided to the executive  officers and directors of
the Company,  including stock  compensation  and loans,  and all bonus and stock
compensation to all employees.

     To the extent appropriate,  the Company intends to take the necessary steps
to conform its compensation practices to comply with the $1 million compensation
deduction  cap under  Section  162(m) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as
amended.

COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND POLICIES

     The policy of the Committee is to attract and retain key personnel  through
the payment of competitive base salaries and to encourage and reward performance
through bonuses and stock ownership. The Committee's objectives are to:

o    ensure  that the  executive  team has clear goals and  accountability  with
     respect to corporate performance;

o    establish  pay  opportunities  that are  competitive  based  on  prevailing
     practices for the industry,  the stage of growth,  and the labor markets in
     which the Company operates;

o    independently  assess  operating  results  on a  regular  basis in light of
     expected Company performance; and

o    align  pay  incentives  with  the  long-term  interests  of  the  Company's
     stockholders.

ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION

     Compensation  for officers and key employees  includes both cash and equity
elements.

     Cash compensation consists of base salary, which is determined by the level
of  responsibility,  expertise and experience of the employee,  and  competitive
conditions  in the  industry.  The  Committee  believes that the salaries of its
officers fall within the software  industry norm. In addition,  cash bonuses may
be awarded to officers and other key employees.  Compensation of sales personnel
also includes sales commissions tied to quarterly targets.

     Ownership  of the  Company's  Common  Stock is a key  element of  executive
compensation.  Officers  and other  employees  of the  Company  are  eligible to
participate  in the 1992 Stock Plan (the  "Option  Plan") and the 1995  Employee
Stock  Purchase  Plan (the  "Purchase  Plan"),  which were adopted  prior to the
Company's  initial public offering in November 1995. The Option Plan permits the
Board of Directors or the  Committee to grant stock options to employees on such
terms as the Board or the  Committee may  determine.  The Committee has the sole
authority  to grant  stock  options to  executive  officers  of the  Company and
currently administers stock option grants to employees.  In determining the size
of a stock option grant to a new officer or other key  employee,  the  Committee
takes into account  equity  participation  by  comparable  employees  within the
Company,   external  competitive   circumstances


                                       16
<PAGE>

and other  relevant  factors.  Additional  options  may be  granted  to  current
employees to reward exceptional  performance or to provide  additional  unvested
equity  incentives.  The Purchase Plan permits employees to acquire Common Stock
of the Company  through  payroll  deductions  and  promotes  broad-based  equity
participation  throughout  the Company.  The Committee  believes that such stock
plans align the interests of the employees  with the long-term  interests of the
stockholders.

     The Company  also  maintains a 401(k) Plan to provide  retirement  benefits
through  tax  deferred  salary  deductions  for all its  employees.  The Company
matches  up to  50%  of an  employee's  contribution,  not to  exceed  $500  per
employee. In addition to the employer matching  contribution,  Advent may make a
profit sharing contribution to the 401(k) Plan at the discretion of the Board of
Directors.

1999 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     Executive compensation for 1999 included base salary, cash and equity-based
incentive compensation and, in the case of sales executives,  sales commissions.
Cash  incentive  compensation  is  designed  to  motivate  executives  to attain
corporate, business unit and individual goals. The Company's policy is to have a
significant  portion of an executive's  total  compensation at risk based on the
Company's overall performance.  Executive officers,  like other employees,  were
eligible for option grants under the Option Plan.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

     Compensation  for the Chief  Executive  Officer is  determined by a process
similar to that  discussed  above for executive  officers.  The Chief  Executive
Officer's  target  base pay level has been  analyzed  using data for  comparable
software  companies.  Mr.  Caswell  receives no other material  compensation  or
benefits not provided to all executive officers,  except for the loan previously
referred to under "Certain Transactions."

     The Committee has considered the potential  impact of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which limits the tax deductibility of
cash  compensation  paid to  individual  executive  officers  to $1 million  per
officer. The cash compensation to be paid to the Company's executive officers in
fiscal  2000 is not  expected  to exceed  the $1  million  limit per  individual
officer.

to bring such business  before such meeting.  To be timely,  such  stockholder's

been  given or made at least  100 days  prior  to such  meeting,  notice  by the
stockholder  to be  timely  must be so  received  not  later  than the  close of

                  (ii) a  representation  that the  stockholder  is a holder  of
                  record of stock of the  Corporation  entitled  to vote at such
                  meeting and, if applicable,  intends to appear in person or by

                  specified in the notice or introduce the business specified in

                  (iii) if  applicable,  a description  of all  arrangements  or
                  understandings  between the  stockholder  and each nominee and
                  any other  person or persons  (naming  such person or persons)
                  pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made
                  by the stockholder;

                  (iv) such other  information  regarding  each  nominee or each
                  matter of business to be proposed by such stockholder as would
                  be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant
                  to the proxy rules of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
                  had the nominee been  nominated,  or intended to be nominated,
                  or the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed by the
                  board of directors' and

         The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of
any person or the  proposal  of any  business  not made in  compliance  with the
foregoing procedure.

         II.6     MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE

personally  or  by   first-class   mail  or  by  telegraphic  or  other  written
communication.  Notices not personally  delivered  shall be sent charges prepaid
and shall be addressed  to the  stockholder  at the address of that  stockholder

telegram or other means of written communication.

         An  affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any

evidence of the giving of such notice.

         II.7     QUORUM

         The  holders  of a  majority  in voting  power of the stock  issued and
outstanding  and entitled to vote thereat,  present in person or  represented by
proxy,  shall  constitute a quorum at all meetings of the  stockholders  for the
transaction  of  business  except as  otherwise  provided  by  statute or by the
certificate  of  incorporation.  If,  however,  such  quorum is not  present  or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders,  then either (i) the chairman of
the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or represented  by proxy,  shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance
with Section 2.8 of these bylaws.

         When a quorum is present at any  meeting,  the vote of the holders of a
majority of the stock having  voting power present in person or  represented  by
proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question
is one upon which, by express  provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or
of the  certificate  of  incorporation  or these  bylaws,  a  different  vote is
required,  in which case such  express  provision  shall  govern and control the
decision of the question.

         If a quorum be  initially  present,  the  stockholders  may continue to
transact business until  adjournment,  notwithstanding  the withdrawal of enough
stockholders  to leave less than a quorum,  if any action taken is approved by a
majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.

         II.8     ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE

         When a meeting is  adjourned  to another  time and place,  unless these
bylaws otherwise  require,  notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if
the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken.  At the adjourned  meeting the  corporation  may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original  meeting.  If the adjournment is
for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the  adjourned  meeting,  a notice of the  adjourned  meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

         II.9     VOTING

         The stockholders  entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall
be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws,
subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law
of  Delaware  (relating  to voting  rights of  fiduciaries,  pledgors  and joint
owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).

         Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation
or these bylaws,  each stockholder  shall be entitled to one vote for each share
of capital stock held by such stockholder.

         II.10    STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING

         Any action  required or  permitted to be taken at any annual or special
meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing  setting forth the action so
taken shall be signed by the holders of  outstanding  stock having not less than
the minimum  number of votes that would be  necessary  to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares  entitled to vote  thereon  were present
and voted. Such consents shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to it
registered office in the state of Delaware,  its principal place of business, or
an  officer  or agent of the  corporation  having  custody  of the book in which
proceedings  of  meetings  of  stockholders  are  recorded.  Delivery  made to a
corporation's  registered  office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested.

         II.11    RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING

         For purposes of determining the stockholders  entitled to notice of any
meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record
date,  which  shall not precede  the date upon which the  resolution  fixing the
record  date is adopted by the board of  directors  and which  shall not be more
than  sixty  (60) days nor less than ten (10) days  before  the date of any such
meeting,  and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are
entitled to notice and to vote,  notwithstanding  any  transfer of any shares on
the books of the corporation after the record date.

         If the board of  directors  does not so fix a record  date,  the record
date for determining  stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting
of  stockholders  shall be at the close of  business  on the  business  day next
preceding  the day on which  notice is given,  or, if notice is  waived,  at the
close of  business  on the  business  day next  preceding  the day on which  the
meeting is held.

         A  determination  of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders  shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting
unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting,
but the  board of  directors  shall  fix a new  record  date if the  meeting  is
adjourned  for more than  thirty  (30)  days from the date set for the  original
meeting.

         The record date for any other  purpose  shall be as provided in Section
8.1 of these bylaws.

         II.12    PROXIES

        Every person  entitled to vote for  directors,  or on any other matter,
shall  have  the  right  to do so  either  in  person  or by one or more  agents
authorized  by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary
of the  corporation,  but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three
(3) years from its date,  unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy
shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether
by manual signature,  typewriting,  telegraphic  transmission,  telefacsimile or
otherwise)  by  the  stockholder  or  the  stockholder's  attorney-


                                       5
<PAGE>

in-fact.  The  revocability  of a  proxy  that  states  on its  face  that it is
irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware.

         II.13    ORGANIZATION

         The  chairman  of the board,  or in the  absence of the  chairman,  the
president, shall call the meeting of the stockholders to order, and shall act as
chairman  of the  meeting.  In the  absence of the  chairman  of the board,  the
president,  and all of the vice  presidents,  the  stockholders  shall appoint a
chairman for such  meeting.  The chairman of any meeting of  stockholders  shall
determine  the order of business and the  procedures  at the meeting,  including
such  matters  as the  regulation  of the  manner of voting  and the  conduct of
business.  The  secretary  of the  corporation  shall  act as  secretary  of all
meetings of the stockholders, but in the absence of the secretary at any meeting
of the  stockholders,  the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act
as secretary of the meeting.

         II.14    LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE

         The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders  entitled to vote at the meeting,  arranged in
alphabetical  order,  and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to
the  examination  of any  stockholder,  for any purpose  germane to the meeting,
during ordinary  business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to
the meeting,  either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held,
which  place  shall be  specified  in the notice of the  meeting,  or, if not so
specified,  at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be
produced  and kept at the time and place of the  meeting  during  the whole time
thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

                                    DIRECTORS

         III.1    POWERS

         Subject to the  provisions of the General  Corporation  Law of Delaware
and to any  limitations  in the  certificate  of  incorporation  or these bylaws
relating  to  action  required  to be  approved  by the  stockholders  or by the
outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed
and all  corporate  powers shall be  exercised by or under the  direction of the
board of directors.

<PAGE>

         III.2    NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

         The board of directors shall consist of six (6) members.  The number of
directors  may be changed by an  amendment  to this bylaw,  duly  adopted by the
board of directors or by the stockholders, or by a duly adopted amendment to the
certificate of incorporation.

         III.3    ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS

         Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws,  directors  shall be
elected at each annual  meeting of  stockholders  to hold office  until the next
annual meeting. Each director, including a director elected or appointed to fill
a vacancy,  shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected
and until a successor has been elected and qualified.

         III.4    RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES

         Any  director  may resign  effective  on giving  written  notice to the
chairman of the board,  the president,  the secretary or the board of directors,
unless  the  notice  specifies  a later  time for  that  resignation  to  become
effective.  If the  resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the
board of  directors  may elect a successor  to take office when the  resignation
becomes effective.

         Vacancies in the board of directors  may be filled by a majority of the
remaining  directors,  even  if  less  than a  quorum,  or by a  sole  remaining
director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of
the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares  represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which
a quorum is  present  (which  shares  voting  affirmatively  also  constitute  a
majority of the required  quorum).  Each  director so elected  shall hold office
until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been
elected and qualified.

         Unless otherwise  provided in the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws:

                  (i) Vacancies and newly created  directorships  resulting from
any  increase  in the  authorized  number  of  directors  elected  by all of the
stockholders  having  the  right to vote as a single  class  may be  filled by a
majority of the directors then in office,  although less than a quorum,  or by a
sole remaining director.

                  (ii)  Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or
series  thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of
the certificate of incorporation,  vacancies and newly created  directorships of
such class or classes  or series  may be filled by a majority  of the  directors
elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office,  or by a sole
remaining director so elected.

         If at any time, by reason of death or resignation  or other cause,  the
corporation  should  have no  directors  in  office,  then  any  officer  or any
stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder,
or other fiduciary  entrusted with like  responsibility for the person or estate

of a stockholder,  may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with
the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply
to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided
in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

         If,  at  the  time  of  filling  any  vacancy  or  any  newly   created
directorship,  the directors then in office  constitute  less than a majority of
the whole board (as constituted  immediately  prior to any such increase),  then
the Court of Chancery may, upon  application of any  stockholder or stockholders
holding at least ten (10)  percent of the total number of the shares at the time
outstanding  having  the right to vote for such  directors,  summarily  order an
election to be held to fill any such  vacancies or newly created  directorships,
or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid,
which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.

committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board, shall have and
may exercise all the powers and  authority of the board,  but no such  committee

resolutions  providing  for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the board
of directors  as provided in Section  151(a) of the General  Corporation  Law of
Delaware,  fix the  designations  and any of the  preferences  or rights of such
shares  relating to dividends,  redemption,  dissolution,  any  distribution  of
assets of the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares
for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any
other class or classes of stock of the corporation),  (ii) adopt an agreement of
merger or consolidation under Sections 251 or 252 of the General Corporation Law
of Delaware,  (iii) recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of
all  or  substantially  all of  the  corporation's  property  and  assets,  (iv)
recommend to the  stockholders a dissolution of the  corporation or a revocation
of a dissolution  or (v) amend the bylaws of the  corporation;  and,  unless the
board resolution  establishing  the committee,  the bylaws or the certificate of
incorporation  expressly so provide,  no such committee  shall have the power or
authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt
a  certificate  of ownership  and merger  pursuant to Section 253 of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware.

                                AND OTHER AGENTS

         VI.1     INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

         The  corporation  shall,  to the  maximum  extent  and  in  the  manner

reasonably  incurred in  connection  with any  threatened,  pending or completed
action,  suit,  or  proceeding  in  which  such  person  was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the  corporation.  For  purposes of this  Section  6.1, a
"director" or "officer" of the  corporation  shall mean any person (i) who is or
was a director or officer of the corporation,  (ii) who is or was serving at the
request  of the  corporation  as a director  or officer of another  corporation,
partnership,  joint  venture,  trust or  other  enterprise,  or (iii)  who was a
director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor  corporation of the
corporation  or of  another  enterprise  at  the  request  of  such  predecessor
corporation.

<PAGE>


         The corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in
connection  with an action,  suit, or proceeding (or part thereof)  initiated by
such  director  or officer  only if the  initiation  of such  action,  suit,  or
proceeding  (or part  thereof) by the director or officer was  authorized by the
board of Directors of the corporation.

         The  corporation  shall pay the expenses  (including  attorney's  fees)
incurred by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification
hereunder  in  defending  any  action,  suit or  proceeding  referred to in this
Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment
of expenses  incurred by a director or officer of the  corporation in advance of
the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an  undertaking  by the  director  or  officer  to repay all  amounts
advanced if it should  ultimately be determined  that the director or officer is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.

         The  rights  conferred  on any  person  by this  Article  shall  not be
exclusive of any other  rights  which such person may have or hereafter  acquire
under any statute,  provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation,
these bylaws,  agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise.

         Any repeal or modification of the foregoing  provisions of this Article
shall not adversely  affect any right or  protection  hereunder of any person in
respect of any act or  omission  occurring  prior to the time of such  repeal or
modification.

         VI.2     INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS

         The corporation  shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the
manner  permitted  by the  General  Corporation  Law of Delaware as the same now
exists or may  hereafter  be  amended,  to  indemnify  any  person  (other  than
directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines,  and amounts  paid in  settlement  actually  and  reasonably  incurred in
connection  with  any  threatened,   pending  or  completed  action,   suit,  or
proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party by reason of the fact that such  person is or was an  employee or agent of
the  corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of
the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who
is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at
the request of the  corporation as an employee or agent of another  corporation,
partnership,  joint  venture,  trust or other  enterprise,  or (iii)  who was an
employee or agent of a corporation  which was a predecessor  corporation  of the
corporation  or of  another  enterprise  at  the  request  of  such  predecessor
corporation.

         VI.3     INSURANCE

         The  corporation  may purchase and maintain  insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director,  officer, employee or agent of the corporation,
or is or was serving at the request of the  corporation as a director,  officer,
employee or agent of another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust or
other enterprise  against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred
by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,
whether  or not the  corporation  would have the power to  indemnify  him or her
against such liability  under the provisions of the General  Corporation  Law of
Delaware.

         VI.4     SAVINGS CLAUSE

         If this Article VI or any portion  thereof shall be  invalidated on any
ground  by any  court of  competent  jurisdiction,  then the  corporation  shall
nevertheless  indemnify  each  director,  officer,  employee  or  agent  of  the
corporation against expenses (including attorney's fees),  judgments,  fines and
amounts paid in  settlement  with  respect to any action,  suit,  proceeding  or
investigation,  whether civil, criminal or administrative,  and whether internal
or external,  including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by
or in the  right  of  the  corporation,  to the  full  extent  permitted  by any
applicable  portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated,  or by
any other applicable law.

         VI.5     CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF   EXPENSES

         The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VI shall,  unless  otherwise prided when authorized or
ratified,  continue  as to a person  who has ceased to be a  director,  officer,
employee  or agent and shall inure to the  benefit of the heirs,  executors  and
administrators of such a person.

         VII.1    MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS

         The corporation shall,  either at its principal  executive office or at
such place or places as designated  by the board of directors,  keep a record of
its  stockholders  listing their names and addresses and the number and class of
shares  held by each  stockholder,  a copy of these  bylaws as  amended to date,
accounting books and other records of its business and properties.

         Any  stockholder  of record,  in person or by attorney or other  agent,

<PAGE>

and records and to make copies or extracts  therefrom.  A proper  purpose  shall
mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In
every  instance  where an  attorney  or other  agent is the person who seeks the
right to  inspection,  the demand under oath shall be  accompanied by a power of
attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so
act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the
corporation  at its registered  office in Delaware or at its principal  place of
business.

         VII.2    INSPECTION BY DIRECTORS

         Any director  shall have the right to examine the  corporation's  stock

a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the corporation.

         VII.4    REPRESENTATION OF SHARES OF OTHER CORPORATIONS

         The chairman of the board,  if any, the president,  any vice president,
the chief financial  officer,  the secretary or any assistant  secretary of this
corporation,  or any other  person  authorized  by the board of directors or the
president or a vice president,  is authorized to vote, represent and exercise on
behalf of this  corporation  all  rights  incident  to any and all shares of the
stock of any other  corporation  or  corporations  standing  in the name of this
corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person
directly  or by any  other  person  authorized  to do so by  proxy  or  power of
attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.

         VII.5    CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF BYLAWS

         The original or a copy of these bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                 GENERAL MATTERS

         VIII.1   RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING

         For  purposes  of  determining  the  stockholders  entitled  to receive
payment of any dividend or other  distribution or allotment of any rights or the
stockholders  entitled  to  exercise  any  rights  in  respect  of  any  change,
conversion or exchange of stock,  or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the board of  directors  may fix, in  advance,  a record  date,  which shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and
which  shall not be more than sixty (60) days  before any such  action.  In that
case, only  stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed
are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to
exercise such rights,  as the case may be,  notwithstanding  any transfer of any
shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as
otherwise provided by law.

         If the  board of  directors  does not so fix a  record  date,  then the
record date for  determining  stockholders  for any such purpose shall be at the
close  of  business  on the day on  which  the  board of  directors  adopts  the
applicable resolution.

         VIII.2   CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS

         From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution
which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for
payment of money,  notes or other evidences of  indebtedness  that are issued in
the name of or payable to the  corporation,  and only the persons so  authorized
shall sign or endorse those instruments.

         VIII.3   CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED

         The board of directors,  except as otherwise  provided in these bylaws,
may authorize and empower any officer or officers,  or agent or agents, to enter
into any contract or execute any  instrument in the name of and on behalf of the
corporation;  such power and  authority  may be general or  confined to specific
instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within
the agency  power of an officer,  no officer,  agent or employee  shall have any
power or authority to bind the  corporation  by any contract or engagement or to
pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.

         VIII.4   STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES

         The shares of the  corporation  shall be represented  by  certificates,
provided  that  the  board  of  directors  of the  corporation  may  provide  by
resolution  or  resolutions  that some or all of any or all classes or series of
its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to
shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
corporation.  Notwithstanding  the adoption of such a resolution by the board of
directors,  every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request,
every holder of uncertificated  shares,  shall be entitled to have a certificate
signed by, or in the name of the corporation  by, the chairman or  vice-chairman
of the  board of  directors,  or the  president  or  vice-president,  and by the
treasurer or an assistant



                                       20
<PAGE>

treasurer,  or the  secretary  or an  assistant  secretary  of such  corporation
representing the number of shares  registered in certificate form. Any or all of
the  signatures  on the  certificate  may be a  facsimile.  In case any officer,
transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been
placed  upon a  certificate  has ceased to be such  officer,  transfer  agent or
registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation
with the  same  effect  as if he or she were  such  officer,  transfer  agent or
registrar at the date of issue.

         Certificates  for shares  shall be of such form and device as the board
of directors  may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the
shares represented thereby;  its number; date of issuance;  the number of shares
for  which it is  issued;  a  summary  statement  or  reference  to the  powers,
designations,  preferences  or  other  special  rights  of  such  stock  and the
qualifications,  limitations or restrictions of such preferences  and/or rights,
if any;  a  statement  or  summary of liens,  if any;  a  conspicuous  notice of
restrictions  upon transfer or registration of transfer,  if any; a statement as
to any applicable  voting trust agreement;  if the shares be assessable,  or, if
assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.

         Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of
a certificate  for shares duly  endorsed or  accompanied  by proper  evidence of
succession,  assignment  or authority  to transfer,  it shall be the duty of the
corporation to issue a new  certificate to the person entitled  thereto,  cancel
the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.

         The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly
paid and  subject  to call for the  remainder  of the  consideration  to be paid
therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock  certificate  issued to represent
any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in
the  case  of  uncertificated  partly  paid  shares,  the  total  amount  of the
consideration  to be paid  therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.
Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall
declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class,  but only upon the
basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

         VIII.5   SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES

         If the  corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock
or more than one series of any class,  then the powers,  the  designations,  the
preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
each class of stock or series  thereof and the  qualifications,  limitations  or
restrictions  of such  preferences  and/or  rights shall be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of the  certificate  that the  corporation  shall
issue to  represent  such  class or series of stock;  provided,  however,  that,
except as otherwise  provided in Section 202 of the General  Corporation  Law of
Delaware,  in lieu of the foregoing  requirements  there may be set forth on the
face or back of the certificate  that the  corporation  shall issue to represent
such class or series of stock a  statement  that the  corporation  will  furnish
without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations,
the  preferences  and the  relative,  participating,  optional or other  special
rights  of each


                                       21
<PAGE>

class  of  stock  or  series  thereof  and the  qualifications,  limitations  or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

         VIII.6   LOST CERTIFICATES

         Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new  certificates for shares
shall be issued to replace a previously issued  certificate unless the latter is
surrendered  to the  corporation  and  cancelled at the same time.  The board of
directors  may,  in case any  share  certificate  or  certificate  for any other
security is lost,  stolen or destroyed,  authorize  the issuance of  replacement
certificates  on such terms and  conditions as the board may require;  the board
may  require  indemnification  of the  corporation  secured  by a bond or  other
adequate security  sufficient to protect the corporation  against any claim that
may be made against it,  including any expense or  liability,  on account of the
alleged loss,  theft or  destruction  of the  certificate or the issuance of the
replacement certificate.

         VIII.7   TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS

         The board of  directors  may  appoint  one or more  transfer  agents or
transfer  clerks,  and  one or  more  registrars,  each  of  which  shall  be an
incorporated  bank or trust company -- either domestic or foreign,  who shall be
appointed at such times and places as the  requirements  of the  corporation may
necessitate and the board of directors may designate.

         VIII.8   CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS

         Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of
construction  and  definitions in the General  Corporation Law of Delaware shall
govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this
provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the
plural  number  includes the singular,  and the term  "person"  includes both an
entity and a natural person.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   AMENDMENTS

         The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended
or repealed by the stockholders  entitled to vote; provided,  however,  that the
corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt,
amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.  The fact that such power has been so
conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor
limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.


                                       22
<PAGE>


         Whenever an  amendment  or new bylaw is adopted,  it shall be copied in
the book of bylaws with the original  bylaws,  in the appropriate  place. If any
bylaw is repealed,  the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the
repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative  written  consent(s)  shall be
stated in said book.

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED

                          CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     Advent Software,  Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws
of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation"), hereby certifies that :

     A. The name of this Corporation, and the name under which it was originally
incorporated, is Advent Software, Inc.

     B.  The  date of  filing  of this  Corporation's  original  Certificate  of
Incorporation with the
Secretary of State of Delaware was October 4, 1995.

     C.  Pursuant to Sections  241 and 245 of the Delaware  General  Corporation
Law, this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation restates, integrates
and amends the provisions of the  Corporation's  Certificate of Incorporation as
follows:

     FIRST. The name of this corporation is Advent Software, Inc.

     SECOND. The address of the corporation's  registered office in the State of
Delaware  is 1209 Orange  Street,  Wilmington,  County of New  Castle,  Delaware
19801. The name of its registered agent at such address is The Corporation Trust
Company.

     THIRD.  The purpose of this  corporation  is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which  corporations may be organized under the General  Corporation
Law of Delaware.

     FOURTH. This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of shares to be
designated   respectively   Preferred  Stock   ("Preferred")  and  Common  Stock
("Common").  The total number of shares of Preferred this corporation shall have
authority to issue shall be 2,000,000,  $.01 par value,  and the total number of

     The  Preferred  Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series
pursuant to a resolution or resolutions providing for such issue duly adopted by
the Board of Directors  (authority to do so being hereby expressly vested in the
Board).  The Board of Directors is further  authorized to determine or alter the
rights, preferences,  privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any
wholly  unissued  series of Preferred  Stock and, to fix the number of shares of
any such series of  Preferred  Stock and the  designation  of any such series of

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     We are a leading  provider of  Enterprise  Investment  Management,  or EIM,
solutions that automate and integrate  mission-critical functions for investment
management professionals.

     Advent Office(TM),  our suite of integrated products,  addresses the demand
for software  products  that  automate,  simplify and  integrate  functions  for
investment  management by automating and integrating  work and data flows across
the entire investment management enterprise. Advent Office reduces client costs,
improves the accuracy of client  information  and enables our clients to provide
enhanced customer service.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND OUR CLIENTS

     Our  clients  include  a range  of  organizations  that  manage  investment
portfolios,  including  investment  advisors,  brokerage firms,  banks and hedge
funds.  Our  clients  also  include  corporations,  public  funds,  foundations,
universities and non-profit  organizations that manage investment portfolios and
perform  similar  portfolio  management  functions.   Recently,  the  investment
management  industry has  experienced  significant  growth which, in combination
with other  factors,  has led to  increasing  demand for software  products that
automate,   simplify  and  integrate  functions  within  investment   management
organizations.  This increasing  demand is driven by several industry  dynamics.
Financial assets under management have increased  substantially  during the last
decade.  As the value of total financial  assets under management has increased,
there has been a  substantial  increase in the number of  investment  management
organizations and a steady introduction of increasingly  sophisticated financial
instruments.  As a  result,  investment  managers  are faced  with  increasingly
complicated  portfolio  accounting  and  management   requirements  as  well  as
extensive and evolving industry standards and government regulations.

     These dynamics have increased the volume and complexity of information  and
data  flows  within  investment   management   organizations  and  between  such
organizations and third parties, such as brokerage firms,  clients,  custodians,
banks,  pricing  services  and other data  providers.  Consequently,  investment
management  organizations  require more  sophisticated  and integrated  software
products for their front, middle and back offices.

     The front office operations of an investment  manager include the marketing
and  customer  relationship  management  aspect of dealing with  customers;  the
middle office focuses on trade order  management and trading  workflow;  and the
back office includes the accounting  functions of the organization.  In order to
operate efficiently within this environment, investment management organizations
must  automate  and  integrate  their   mission-critical   and   labor-intensive
functions,  including (i) investment  decision  support and client  relationship
management,  (ii) order  management and trading and (iii) portfolio  accounting,
performance measurement, report generation and compliance. Investment management
organizations   historically  have  relied  on  internally   developed  systems,
timesharing services or simple  spreadsheet-based  systems to manage information
flows. Due to inherent limitations in each of these types of systems, investment
management organizations are demanding highly


                                       2

functional,   easy-to-use,   scalable,   cost-effective  and  flexible  software
applications  that  automate  and  integrate  their  mission-critical   business
functions.

THE ADVENT SOLUTION

     The Advent solution  combines a fully  integrated  suite of  client-centric
software  products,   with  a  full  range  of  professional   services  -  from
implementation   management  and  training  to  technical   support  and  custom
engineering, all aimed at accomplishing our clients' business objectives.

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

     We offer an  integrated  suite of  software  products  for  automating  and
integrating work and data flows across the investment  management  organization,
as well as the information flows between the investment management  organization
and external parties.  Our products are intended to reduce client costs, improve
the accuracy of client  information and generally  enable clients to improve the
service  they provide to their  customers  rather than  focusing on  operational
details.  Each software  component in the Advent Office suite focuses on certain
mission-critical  functions  of the  investment  management  organization.  Each
Advent  Office  implementation  is  tailored  to meet the needs of a  particular
market segment, as determined by size, assets under management and complexity of
the investment environment.

     We believe that our Enterprise Investment  Management,  or EIM, solution is
well suited for the  investment  management  functions of  corporations,  public
funds, partnerships,  foundations, universities and non-profit organizations. An
Enterprise  Investment  Management  solution  is an  evolutionary  process  that
encompasses three phases:

o    Investment Process Integration - involves the integration of front-,  mid-,
     and  back-office  components  with  each  other  as well  as with  standard
     productivity  applications  such as Microsoft  Word(R) and  Excel(R).  This
     integration  eliminates  ineffective  communication  between  processes and
     minimizes processing errors, enabling growth by reducing bottlenecks within
     the company.

o    Data  Collection  and  Reconciliation  -  enables  the  investment  firm to
     integrate the external data regarding  pricing and  settlements so that the
     firm  can  quickly  and  efficiently   settle   transactions   and  monitor
     performance in an automated fashion.

o    Customer  Responsiveness - incorporates  numerous capabilities enabling our
     clients  to  provide  more  personal,  effective  communication  with their
     customers.  This  capability  enables  decision makers for the firm to have
     timely access to information  in order to make more effective  decisions on
     behalf of the clients.

BACK OFFICE

     We offer three portfolio accounting and management systems: Axys(R), Advent
Partner(R)  and  Geneva(R),  each  targeted at a different  market  segment,  to
automate  the back  office  functions.  We also  offer  additional  back  office
applications,  including our REX(TM)  solution,  which  provides  reconciliation
management,   and  our  Advent  Warehouse(TM)  solution,   which  provides  data
warehousing capabilities.

     AXYS,  our  core  product,  introduced  in  1993,  is a  highly  functional
portfolio   accounting  and  management   system  targeted  towards   investment
management  organizations of all sizes. Axys provides  investment  professionals
with  broad  portfolio  accounting   functionality,   timely  decision  support,
sophisticated  performance  measurement  and flexible  reporting.  Specifically,
clients  can  record,  account  for  and  report  on  a  variety  of  investment
instruments, including equities, fixed income, mutual funds and cash. Axys users
gain access on demand to  portfolio  holdings,  asset  allocation,  realized and
unrealized  gains and losses,  actual and  projected  income and other  valuable
data. Portfolio performance can be measured for individual portfolios or related
groups, and for any specified time period.  Investment  professionals can choose
from over 200 pre-defined reports with flexible "as-of" reporting,  which can be
customized as to formats and fonts. Clients can easily generate fully customized
reports with the assistance of the Axys Report Writer.  Clients can also produce
presentation-quality  graphics via an  integrated  link with  Microsoft  Excel's
charting  capability.   In  addition,  Axys  offers  integrated   multi-currency
capabilities  which,  among other  things,  allow  reports to be restated in any
currency,   tracks  reclaimable   foreign  withholding  tax,  and  can  identify
components  of  return  attributable  to  market  prices  versus  currency  rate
fluctuations.

     Axys also provides integration with a variety of investment tools and data.
These tools include (i) Moxy, our trade order management solution, (ii) pricing,
corporate  actions,  analytics  and  fundamental  data  via  interfaces  to data
vendors, (iii) automatic

data entry and  reconciliation of trades with interfaces to the Depository Trust
Corporation (DTC), brokerage firms and custodians,  (iv) integrating through the
Internet via our custodial data service and software, and (v) Internet reporting
via Advent Browser  Reporting(TM) for Enterprise  Users, our Internet  reporting
service.

     ADVENT PARTNER,  introduced in December 1996, is an investment  partnership
allocation  solution,  which  integrates with Axys. This product is specifically
designed for hedge funds, venture funds and limited investment partnerships that
face  the  complex  and  time-consuming  task  of  consistently  and  accurately
accounting for and reporting on partnership tax allocation and other activities.
The  Windows-based  system  tracks  partner-specific  information,  handles  the
complexities  of  allocating  realized and  unrealized  gains and losses for tax
purposes,  allocates  performance incentive fees, provides on-demand partner and
partnership reporting on an economic or tax allocation basis and streamlines the
production of partnership tax returns (K-1's).

     GENEVA,  introduced to target  organizations in 1995 and made  commercially
available in October 1997, is a high-end portfolio accounting system designed to
meet  the  needs of  large,  global  investment  management  organizations  with
complex,  international  accounting  requirements.  Geneva  offers  feature-rich
global accounting,  extensive reporting  (including profit and loss reporting by
strategy) and sophisticated  multicurrency  capabilities.  In addition, Geneva's
highly flexible design allows users to add newly created  financial  instruments
and tailor accounting treatments to their specific needs.

     REX,  introduced  in the  second  quarter  of 1997,  is the  Advent  Office
solution  for  reconciliation  management.  REX is  integrated  with Axys and is
designed for firms that want to electronically  reconcile their Axys information
against their  custodial  information.  REX  automates  matching and helps users
identify  exceptions,  correct  or  add  transactions  to  their  portfolios  or
communicate and track changes required by their custodian.

     ADVENT WAREHOUSE, introduced in 1998, is a data warehouse solution designed
to allow investment  professionals to readily access  investment data regardless
of how the data was created or maintained,  without impacting the performance of
their high volume transaction-based Advent Office systems. Relational technology
and data  warehousing  tools  provide an open  environment  for ad hoc  decision
support and  customized  reporting on enterprise  wide  investment  information.
Investment  professionals can take advantage of the sea of information  captured
during the investment  process to improve  client  service and gain  competitive
advantage.

MIDDLE OFFICE

     MOXY(R),  introduced  in 1995,  automates and  streamlines  the trading and
order management process.  Moxy facilitates  accurate trade order management and
preparation, tracks trade-order status, automates the allocation of block trades
across multiple portfolios and electronically interfaces with Axys to provide an
integrated solution. Moxy supports fixed income, mutual funds and equity trading
and offers  multicurrency  capabilities.  Moxy  enables  investment  managers to
accurately  adjust  portfolio  holdings,  rebalance  portfolios  against models,
interactively  assess "what-if" scenarios and automatically  create orders to be
executed.  For traders,  Moxy tracks cash and positions  during the trading day,
enables the accurate  preparation of block trades and internal  electronic trade
tickets,   facilitates  compliance  with  investment  restrictions  and  trading
requirements and minimizes  trading errors.  Moxy also allows traders and others
to view the status of orders via customizable screens and maintain an electronic
audit trail of the trade  process.  Moxy  automates  the  allocation  process of
partial and complete  executions and allows the user to send allocation  results
using OASYS,  an electronic  allocation  system,  to communicate  allocations to
brokers  electronically.  Moxy also  provides  Internet-ready  electronic  order
routing based on the industry standard FIX messaging protocol so that Moxy users
can route trades  electronically to any FIX-compliant broker or crossing network
that  supports  the Internet or other TCP/IP  connections.  Moxy  electronically
posts  allocated  trades  into Axys on demand,  eliminating  time-consuming  and
error-prone manual entry.

FRONT OFFICE

     QUBE(R), introduced in 1995, is designed to help securities professionals
develop  and improve  client  relationships  by  automating  scheduling,  client
communications  and client data.  For example,  Qube  integrates  with portfolio
information on Axys and enables investment professionals to interactively screen
client  investment  profiles and notes of conversations to identify  appropriate
candidates for various investment  opportunities.  In addition, Qube can be used
to  enhance  direct   marketing   campaigns  by  matching  clients  with  market
opportunities.  Qube captures  extensive  investment  profile  information,  has
on-line query capability,  networking  features and mail merge  capabilities and
facilitates information sharing across professionals in an office.

     ADVENT BROWSER REPORTING FOR DECISION MAKERS,  introduced in 1998, puts the
power of data  analysis on the  portfolio  managers'  desktop via the  Internet.
Using our On-line  Analytical  Processing  tools (OLAP),  investment data can be
sliced  and  diced to  improve  the  decision  making  process.  ADVENT  BROWSER
REPORTING FOR INVESTORS,  also introduced in 1998, allows investment managers to
post Axys  reports to a secure  website  where their  clients  can access  these
reports 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  ADVENT BROWSER  REPORTING FOR ENTERPRISE
USERS  allows  investment  professionals  the ability to access Axys from remote
locations via the Internet and run Axys reports as if they were in their office.

GRANTS MANAGEMENT

     GIFTS FOR WINDOWS(TM) is a proposal  tracking and grants  management system
that allows the user to retrieve and classify  requests,  generate  personalized
letters,  manage contacts,  schedule and monitor  activities,  maintain complete
organization history,  track payments,  contingencies and report requests.  This
software  product  is  primarily  used by the  philanthropic  community  such as
foundations,  corporations and other  organizations to manage their grant-making
activities.

MAINTENANCE SUPPORT AND DATA INTERFACES

     We earn recurring  revenues by offering a choice of  maintenance  contracts
and by providing  proprietary  interfaces to external  sources of critical data.
These interfaces allow clients to (1) download  pricing,  corporate  actions and
other  data from  third  party  vendors  such as  Interactive  Data  Corporation
(Interactive  Data), a wholly owned indirect  subsidiary of Pearson plc, and (2)
interface with DTC, certain brokerage firms and custodians for trading activity.
Many of our clients use our  proprietary  interface to  electronically  retrieve
pricing  and  other  data  from  Interactive  Data.  Interactive  Data pays us a
commission based on Interactive  Data's revenues from providing such data to our
clients.

     Our Hub Data subsidiary  consolidates  securities information and data from
various  third party  providers  such as Muller Data  Corporation,  Standard and
Poor's J.J. Kenny, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Interactive Data and
others,   and  provides  data  feeds  and  services  to  a  range  of  financial
institutions via electronic interfaces to many portfolio software systems.

     Due to the mission-critical  nature of our products,  many clients purchase
annual  maintenance  contracts,  which  entitle  them to  technical  support and
product upgrades as they become  available.  We continually  upgrade and enhance
our  products  to  respond  to  changing  market  needs,   evolving   regulatory
requirements and new technologies.

INTERNET INITIATIVE

     We believe the Internet will be a low-cost  communications platform used to
integrate external information into our products,  thereby providing our clients
with straight through processing of business  information.  To take advantage of
the Internet, we have launched an Internet Initiative, developing services, both
announced and unannounced,  to bring Internet-based products and services to our
clients.  We launched REX, our first Internet  service during the second quarter
of 1997. Using the Internet, REX consolidates communication and information from
all  participating  custodians,  enabling  our  clients  to  quickly  and easily
reconcile  transactions  and  holdings  with a click of the  mouse.  Our  second
Internet-based product is Advent Browser Reporting, which we introduced in 1998.
Advent  Browser  Reporting  is a reporting  component  of Advent  Office,  which
provides  users the ability to access  Advent Office  information  through a web
browser. In May 1999, we introduced Advent Corporate Actions, an enterprise-wide
notification  service  that  automates  and  simplifies  the process of tracking
corporate actions such as mergers, spin-offs and bankruptcies.

     Additionally  we  have  added  Distance  Learning  and  Advent  Connection.
Distance Learning is Advent's online  interactive  classroom  offering education
services via the Internet.  Now our clients can  participate  in an  interactive
education  session with a certified Advent  instructor from the comfort of their
office or home.  Advent  Connection is our  client-only  website which  provides
technical information,  support, educational offerings,  discussion groups and a
software center that allows our clients to download free client reports.

     From  time to  time,  as we  begin  the  development  of new  products  and
services,  including our Internet Initiative,  we plan to continue to enter into
development agreements with information  providers,  clients, or other companies
in order to accelerate the delivery of new products and services.

ALLIANCE PROGRAM

     Our  Alliance  Program was  launched in May 1998 and is designed to benefit
both our clients and our partners. The program provides a formal process through
which partners can develop,  promote,  and sell their  products,  services,  and
solutions in conjunction  with our suite of  applications.  Our Alliance Program
was created to further extend our breadth of product and service offerings.

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

     Professional  services  consist of consulting,  implementation  management,
integration management, custom programming, and training. To ensure a successful
product implementation, consultants assist clients with the initial installation
of a system,  assist  in the  conversion  of the  client's  historical  data and
provide ongoing training and education.  Consulting services may be required for
as  little  as two  days  for  small  systems  or up to  many  weeks  for  large
implementations. We believe that consulting services facilitate a client's early
success  with our  products,  strengthen  the  relationship  with the client and
generate valuable feedback for us.

     Implementation  management provides a single point-of-contact who will work
closely with our client's project team to plan the  implementation,  to optimize
the use of our products,  to coordinate Advent  resources,  to advocate on their
behalf,  and to  minimize  schedule  delays  and  project  risks.  Additionally,
implementation  managers  provide  documentation  for  the  implementation  from
planning through production.

     Integration  management  provides  services  to clients  with more  complex
needs.  Integration  managers  work with the clients  during  implementation  to
integrate their systems and workflows with our products.  The services  include:
development of custom  interfaces from back-office  systems to our Axys and Moxy
products,  configuration and management of large volumes of data, and strategies
for deployment of our products for distributed sites.

     We provide our clients with custom programming services that enable clients
to tailor end-user reports to their own specifications. We also provide training
sessions to our clients at various  sites across the country.  Additionally,  we
host semi-annual conferences that provide product information and user workshops
for our clients.

CLIENTS

     Our clients  vary  significantly  in size and assets under  management  and
include investment advisors,  brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds, corporations,
public funds,  universities and non-profit  organizations.  At present,  we have
licensed  products to over 5,800  institutions  in 36 countries  for use by more
than 60,000 concurrent users.

SALES AND MARKETING

Sales

     We sell  our  products  and  services  primarily  through  a  direct  sales
organization comprised of field sales and telesales  representatives.  Our field
sales force is organized by geographic  region and is primarily  responsible for
selling our suite of  products  to  mid-sized  and large  investment  management
organizations.  We have  sales  offices  in San  Francisco,  CA,  New York,  NY,
Cambridge, MA and Melbourne,  Australia. Our telesales organization is primarily
focused on selling our products to existing Axys clients and small and mid-sized
investment management  organizations.  Our telesales representatives are located
in San Francisco, CA, New York, NY, Cambridge, MA and Melbourne,  Australia. Our
sales force is supported by extensive, ongoing product and sales training.

 Marketing

     Our marketing department is responsible for assessing market opportunities,
product  planning and management and specific sales support.  In addition to its
traditional marketing functions, our marketing organization is actively involved
in a process  called "Market  Validation."  Market  Validation  uses a system of
interaction  with  and  input  from  potential  and  existing  clients,  product
development,  sales and client  services and support  departments  to define the
scope,  features and  functionality  of new products  and product  upgrades.  In
addition,  our product managers are responsible for all phases of a product life
cycle from product  development  through product  introduction  and beyond.  Our
marketing  department is also  responsible  for corporate  marketing,  including
generating client leads, targeted direct mail campaigns, seminars,  advertising,
trade shows and conferences


                                       6

and public relations  efforts and also provides the sales force with appropriate
written and electronic materials to use during the sales process.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

     In recent years, we have  substantially  increased our product  development
expenditures  in order to  accelerate  the  rate of new  product  introductions,
incorporate new technologies  and sustain the quality of our products.  In 1999,
1998, and 1997, our product  development  expenditures were approximately  $16.8
million, $12.6 million, and $9.4 million,  respectively. Our product development
activities include the  identification and validation of product  specifications
as well as engineering, quality assurance and documentation.

     Our  new  products  and  product   upgrades   require  varying  degrees  of
development time,  depending upon the complexity of the accounting  requirements
and securities  regulations  which they are intended to address,  as well as the
number and type of features incorporated. To date, we have primarily relied upon
the internal development of our products. We have in the past acquired,  and may
again in the future  acquire,  additional  technologies  or products  from third
parties or  consultants.  We intend to  continue  to support  industry  standard
operating environments, client/server architectures and network protocols.

     We may not be  successful  in  developing,  introducing  and  marketing new
products or product  enhancements  on a timely and cost effective  basis,  or at
all, and our new products and product  enhancements  may not adequately meet the
requirements  of the  marketplace  or achieve market  acceptance.  Delays in the
commencement of commercial  shipments of new products or enhancements may result
in client  dissatisfaction  and  delay or loss of  product  revenues.  If we are
unable,  for  technological  or other  reasons,  to develop  and  introduce  new
products or enhancements of existing  products in a timely manner in response to
changing  market  conditions or client  requirements,  or if new products or new
versions of existing  products do not achieve  market  acceptance,  our business
would be seriously harmed. In addition,  our ability to develop new products and
product  enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software  vendors,
including  certain  system  software  vendors,  such as  Microsoft  Corporation,
database vendors and development  tool vendors.  If the products of such vendors
have design defects or flaws,  or if such products are  unexpectedly  delayed in
their introduction, our business could be seriously harmed. Software products as
complex as those  offered by us may  contain  undetected  defects or errors when
first  introduced  or as  new  versions  are  released.  Although  we  have  not
experienced adverse effects resulting from any software errors, we cannot assure
you that,  despite testing by us and our clients,  defects or errors will not be
found in new products after commencement of commercial  shipments,  resulting in
loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

COMPETITION

     The market for investment management software is segmented by the relative
size of the organizations that manage investment portfolios.  The market in each
segment is intensely competitive and highly fragmented,  subject to rapid change
and highly  sensitive  to new product  introductions  and  marketing  efforts by
industry participants. Our competitors include providers of software and related
services as well as providers of timeshare  services.  Competitors vary in size,
scope of services  offered and  platforms  supported.  In  addition,  we compete
indirectly with existing and potential  clients,  many of whom develop their own
software for their  particular  needs and  therefore may be reluctant to license
software products offered by independent vendors such as Advent. With respect to
the market for our portfolio accounting products, we currently compete primarily
with Shaw Data, a division of SunGard Data Systems,  Inc., Thomson Financial,  a
division  of The  Thomson  Corporation,  and  with a  number  of  other  smaller
companies.  We believe that the  principal  competitive  factors  affecting  our
market include product performance and functionality,  ease of use, scalability,
ability to integrate  external  data  sources,  product and company  reputation,
client service and support and price.  We may not compete  successfully  against
current and future competitors,  and competitive pressures could result in price
reductions, reduced operating margins or the loss of market share.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

     Our success is dependent in part on our ability to protect our proprietary
technology.  We rely on a combination  of copyright and  trademark  laws,  trade
secrets,  software  security  measures,  confidentiality  agreements and license
agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights and our software.  We
have  registered  trademarks  including  our  "Advent"  name and  logo.  We will
continue to evaluate the  registration of additional  trademarks as appropriate.
We generally enter into  confidentiality  agreements with our employees and with
our  resellers and  customers.  Despite  these  efforts,  it may be possible for
unauthorized  third  parties to copy  certain  portions  of our  products  or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information.  We do
not  have  any  patents,   and  existing  copyright  laws  afford  only  limited
protection.  In  addition,  we cannot be certain  that  others  will not develop
substantially   equivalent  or  superseding  proprietary  technology,   or  that
equivalent  products  will not be marketed  in


                                       7
<PAGE>

competition with our products,  thereby substantially  reducing the value of our
proprietary rights.  Furthermore,  confidentiality agreements between us and our
employees or any license  agreements with our clients may not provide meaningful
protection of our proprietary  information in the event of any  unauthorized use
or disclosure of it. In addition,  the laws of certain  countries do not protect
our  proprietary  rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.
Accordingly,  we may not be able to protect  our  proprietary  software  against
unauthorized  third party  copying or use,  which could  significantly  harm our
business.

EMPLOYEES

  As of March 1,  2000,  we had 603  employees,  including  75 in sales,  109 in
professional  services,  30 in  marketing,  168 in product  development,  117 in
client services and support and 104 in finance,  administration,  operations and
general  management.  We  believe  that we  maintain  competitive  compensation,
benefits,  equity  participation  and work  environment  policies  to  assist in
attracting  and  retaining  qualified  personnel.   Our  success  depends  to  a
significant  extent upon a limited  number of members of senior  management  and
other key employees, including Stephanie DiMarco, our Chairman of the Board. The
loss of the service of one or more senior managers or other employees could have
a material  adverse  effect upon our business,  operating  results and financial
condition.  None of our employees are  represented by a labor union. We have not
experienced  any work stoppages and we consider  relations with our employees to
be good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     We lease office space in San  Francisco,  CA, New York, NY,  Millburn,  NJ,
Cambridge,  MA, and Melbourne,  Australia.  We have three separate leases in San
Francisco;  a 59,000  square foot lease on our main office that  expires in 2008
with a five-year  extension  option;  a 32,000  square foot lease in an adjacent
building that expires in 2004 with a five-year  extension  option;  and a 60,000
square foot lease that expires in 2009 with two consecutive  five-year extension
options.  This office space is directly  across the street from the main office.
These are Advent's  principal  executive  offices,  where  product  development,
marketing,  technical  support and production  are located.  Advent leases three
separate  office  spaces in New York.  We  currently  have a 12,100  square foot
lease,  expiring in April 2000.  We signed a new lease for 30,100  square  feet,
expiring in 2010, with a five-year extension option at another location near the
current space and plan to occupy the premises by April 2000.  Our third lease in
New York is a 29,000 square foot lease for MicroEdge that expires in 2008 with a
five-year extension. We have a 1000 square foot lease in New Jersey that expires
in June 2002. We have a 6,700 square foot lease in Cambridge,  MA, which expires
in 2003. In addition, there is a 5,300 square foot lease in Melbourne, Australia
that expires in 2004, with a five-year  extension  option. We believe that these
facilities are adequate for our near-term needs and that suitable  additional or
alternative space will be available as needed.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     From time to time we are involved in  litigation  incidental to the conduct
of our  business.  We are not party to any lawsuit or  proceeding  that,  in our
opinion, is likely to seriously harm our business.

                                     PART II

     With the exception of the information incorporated by reference to the 1999
Annual Report to Stockholders in Part II of this Form 10-K, Advent's 1999 Annual
Report to Stockholders is not deemed to be filed as part of this Form 10-K.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

     Advent  had  approximately  82  stockholders  of record  at March 6,  2000.
Because  many of our  shares  of  Common  Stock  are held by  brokers  and other
institutions  on behalf of  stockholders,  we are unable to  estimate  the total
number of stockholders  represented by these record holders.  Other  information
required by this Item is  incorporated  by reference  to the  sections  entitled
"Selected  Financial  Data  -  Price  Range  of  Common  Stock"  and  "Corporate
Information - Stock Information" in Advent's 1999 Annual Report to Stockholders.

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

     Other information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the
sections  entitled  "Selected  Financial  Data -  Selected  Annual  Data"  and "
- -Selected Quarterly Data" in Advent's 1999 Annual Report to Stockholders.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

     The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the
section entitled  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition
and Results of Operations" in Advent's 1999 Annual Report to Stockholders.

     In addition,  we operate in a rapidly changing  environment that involves a
number of risks, some of which are beyond our control.  The following discussion
highlights some of these risks.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN
OUR EXISTING GROWTH RATES.

     Licenses into  multi-user  networked  environments  have  increased both in
individual  size and  number,  and the  timing  and size of  individual  license
transactions are becoming increasingly  important factors in quarterly operating
results.  The sales cycles for  transactions  of this size are often lengthy and
unpredictable.  We may not be successful  in closing large license  transactions
such


                                       9
<PAGE>

as these on a timely basis or at all. Accordingly, if future revenues from large
site licenses  constitute a material portion of our net revenues,  the timing of
such licenses  could cause  additional  variability  in our quarterly  operating
results.  We typically  ship our software  products  shortly  after receipt of a
signed license agreement and initial payment and, consequently, software product
backlog  at the  beginning  of any  quarter  typically  represents  only a small
portion of that  quarter's  expected  revenues.  Our expense levels are based in
significant  part on our  expectations  of future  revenues  and  therefore  are
relatively  fixed in the short term.  Due to the fixed nature of these  expenses
combined with the relatively  high gross margin  historically  achieved by us on
products  and  services,  an  unanticipated  decline  in  net  revenues  in  any
particular  quarter is likely to  disproportionately  adversely affect operating
results.

     We have  generally  realized  lower revenues from license fees in the first
quarter of the year than in the last quarter of the prior year.  We believe that
this has been due  primarily  to the  concentration  by some  clients  of larger
capital  purchases in the fourth  quarter of the  calendar  year and their lower
purchasing  activity during the subsequent first quarter.  We believe our annual
incentive  compensation  plans,  which tend to produce increased  year-end sales
activity,  compound  this  factor.  Furthermore,  we  have  often  recognized  a
substantial portion of each quarter's license revenues in the last month of that
quarter.

     Because of the above factors,  we believe that period to period comparisons
of  our  operating  results  are  not  necessarily  meaningful  and  that  these
comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.

     Our stock  price has  fluctuated  significantly  since our  initial  public
offering in November  1995.  Like many  companies in the technology and emerging
growth sector, our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations, particularly
during  times of high  market  volatility.  If net  revenues  or earnings in any
quarter fail to meet the investment community's expectations, our stock price is
likely to  decline.  In  addition,  our stock  price may be  affected by broader
market trends unrelated to our performance.

OUR SALES CYCLE IS LONG AND WE HAVE  LIMITED  ABILITY TO FORECAST THE TIMING AND
AMOUNT OF SPECIFIC SALES.

     Because the purchase of our software  products often requires  significant,
executive-level  investment  and systems  architecture  decisions by prospective
customers,  we must generally engage in a relatively lengthy sales effort. These
transactions  may be delayed during the customer  acceptance  process because we
must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding
the use and benefit of our  products.  As a result,  the sales cycle  associated
with the  purchase of our software  products is  typically  between two and nine
months  depending  upon the size of the  client,  though it can be  considerably
longer,  and is  subject  to a number of  significant  risks  over which we have
little or no control,  including customers'  budgeting  constraints and internal
acceptance  procedures.  As a result of the length of our sales  cycle,  we have
limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales.  The timing
of large  individual  sales is  especially  difficult to  forecast.  Because our
expenses are generally  relatively  fixed in the near term,  any shortfall  from
anticipated  revenues  could result in  significant  variations in our operating
results from quarter to quarter.

     The  implementation of our solutions  involves a significant  commitment of
resources by customers and by us over an extended period of time. Also, the size
and complexity of any particular  implementation project can cause delays in the
sales cycle that precedes it. Any such delays could seriously harm our business.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON OUR PRODUCT, AXYS.

  In 1997, 1998 and 1999, we derived a substantial  majority of our net revenues
from the licensing of Axys and related products and services. In addition,  many
of our other  products,  such as Moxy,  Qube and various  data  interfaces  were
designed to operate with Axys to provide an integrated solution. As a result, we
believe that a majority of our net revenues,  at least through 2000, will depend
upon continued market  acceptance of Axys,  enhancements or upgrades to Axys and
related products and services.

WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR INTERNET INITIATIVE.

     To take advantage of the Internet,  we are continuing to expand an Internet
initiative  under  which  we  are  developing   services,   both  announced  and
unannounced, to bring Internet-based products and services to clients. The first
of these  services,  Rex, was launched  during the second  quarter of 1997.  The
second service,  Advent Browser Reporting,  was launched in the third quarter of
1998. As we develop new products and services under our Internet Initiative,  we
have and will continue to enter into  development  agreements  with  information
providers, clients or other companies in order to accelerate the delivery of new
products  and  services.  We may not be  successful  in  marketing  our Internet
services or in developing  other Internet  services.  Our failure to do so could
seriously harm our business.


                                       10
<PAGE>

WE EXPECT OUR GROSS MARGIN MAY FLUCTUATE OVER TIME.

     We also expect that our gross margins may  fluctuate  from period to period
as  we  continue  to  introduce  new  recurring  revenue  products,  expand  our
professional  services  organization  and associated  revenue,  continue to hire
additional  personnel and increase  other  expenses to support our business.  We
plan our expense levels based primarily on forecasted  revenue  levels.  Because
these expenses are relatively  fixed in the short term, a fluctuation in revenue
could lead to operating results differing from expectations

WE MUST CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS.

     The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change,
changes in customer demands and evolving industry  standards.  As a result,  our
future  success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products
that  address  the future  needs of our target  markets  and to respond to these
changing  standards  and  practices.  Delays in the  commencement  of commercial
shipments of new products or enhancements  may result in client  dissatisfaction
and delay or loss of product revenues.  In addition,  our ability to develop new
products  and  product  enhancements  is  dependent  upon the  products of other
software  vendors,   including  system  software  vendors,   such  as  Microsoft
Corporation,  database vendors and development tool vendors.  If the products of
these  vendors  have  design  defects  or  flaws,   or  if  these  products  are
unexpectedly  delayed in their  introduction,  our  business  could be seriously
harmed.

WE DEPEND UPON FINANCIAL MARKETS.

     The target clients for our products include a range of  organizations  that
manage investment  portfolios,  including investment advisors,  brokerage firms,
banks and hedge  funds.  In  addition,  we target  corporations,  public  funds,
universities  and  non-profit   organizations,   which  also  manage  investment
portfolios  and have many of the same needs.  The success of many of our clients
is intrinsically  linked to the health of the financial markets. We believe that
demand for our products could be  disproportionately  affected by  fluctuations,
disruptions,  instability or downturns in the financial  markets which may cause
clients and  potential  clients to exit the industry or delay,  cancel or reduce
any  planned  expenditures  for  investment   management  systems  and  software
products.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY REDUCE OUR LICENSE REVENUES.

     We believe  that the market for large  management  software  systems may be
negatively impacted by a number of factors, including:

        o reductions in capital expenditures by large customers;

        o poor performance of major financial markets, and

        o increasing competition.

The above factors may, in turn,  give rise to a number of market trends that may
slow license revenue growth across the industry, including:

        o longer sales cycles;

        o deferral or delay of information technology projects and generally
          reduced expenditures for software; and

        o increased priced competition.

     Although we do not believe  these  factors  have  impacted  our revenues to
date, the continued presence of these factors in the market for large management
software systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

IF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH INTERACTIVE DATA IS TERMINATED, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE
HARMED.

     Many  of our  clients  use  our  proprietary  interface  to  electronically
retrieve pricing and other data from Interactive Data.  Interactive Data pays us
a commission  based on their  revenues from  providing this data to our clients.
Our software  products


                                       11
<PAGE>

have been  customized to be compatible with their system and this software would
need to be  redesigned  if  their  services  were  unavailable  for any  reason.
Termination  of our agreement with  Interactive  Data would require at least two
years notice by either us or them, or 90 days in the case of material breach. If
our  relationship  with  Interactive Data were terminated or their services were
unavailable  to our clients for any reason,  replacing  these  services could be
costly and time consuming.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

     The market for investment  management software is intensely competitive and
highly  fragmented,  subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product
introductions  and marketing efforts by industry  participants.  Our competitors
include  providers  of software  and related  services as well as  providers  of
timeshare services.

     Our  competitors  vary in size,  scope of services  offered  and  platforms
supported.  In addition,  we compete  indirectly  with  existing  and  potential
clients,  many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and
therefore may be reluctant to license  software  products offered by independent
vendors like us. Many of our  competitors  have longer  operating  histories and
greater  financial,  technical,  sales and  marketing  resources  than we do. We
cannot  guarantee that we will be able to compete  successfully  against current
and future  competitors or that  competitive  pressures will not result in price
reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which
could seriously harm our business.

WE FACE CHALLENGES IN EXPANDING OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

     We market and sell our  products  in the  United  States  and,  to a lesser
extent,  internationally.  We have established a subsidiary located in Australia
to market and sell our  products  in  Australia.  In  addition,  during  1999 we
entered into a  distributor  relationship  with Advent  Europe,  an  independent
entity financially backed by our existing  distributor in Scandinavia.  In order
to expand our international  operations,  we would need to continue to establish
additional  facilities,  acquire  other  businesses  or  enter  into  additional
distribution  relationships  in other parts of the world.  The  expansion of our
existing  international  operations  and  entry  into  additional  international
markets will require significant  management  attention and financial resources.
We cannot be certain that our  investments in  establishing  facilities in other
countries  will produce  desired  levels of revenue.  We currently  have limited
experience  in developing  localized  versions of our products and marketing and
distributing our products internationally. In addition, international operations
are subject to other inherent risks, including:

        o The impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;

        o Greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer
          collection periods;

        o Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

        o Difficulties in successfully adapting our products to the language and
          technology standards of other countries;

        o Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;

        o Reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

        o Potentially adverse tax consequences; and

        o Political and economic instability.

     Our international  revenues are generally  denominated in US dollars,  with
the exception of our  subsidiary,  Advent  Australia.  The  revenues,  expenses,
assets and  liabilities  of our  subsidiary,  Advent  Australia,  are  primarily
denominated  in  Australian  dollars.  We do not  currently  engage in  currency
hedging activities.  Although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has been
insignificant,  future  fluctuations  in currency  exchange  rates may adversely
affect  revenues  from  international  sales and the US  dollar  value of Advent
Australia's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities.

UNDETECTED  SOFTWARE ERRORS OR FAILURES FOUND IN NEW PRODUCTS MAY RESULT IN LOSS
OF OR DELAY IN MARKET  ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT COULD  SERIOUSLY HARM OUR
BUSINESS.

     Our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first
introduced or as new versions are released. Despite testing by us and by current
and  potential  customers,  errors may not be found in new products  until after
commencement of commercial shipments,  resulting in loss of or a delay in market
acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

IF WE ARE  UNABLE TO  PROTECT  OUR  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO
INCREASED COMPETITION THAT COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

     Our success  depends  significantly  upon our  proprietary  technology.  We
currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws,  trade secrets,
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary
rights.  We seek to  protect  our  software,  documentation  and  other  written
materials  under trade  secret and  copyright  laws,  which  afford only limited
protection.  We cannot assure you that we will develop  proprietary  products or
technologies that are patentable,  that any patent, if issued,  would provide us
with any competitive  advantages or would not be challenged by third parties, or
that the patents of others will not adversely affect our ability to do business.

     Litigation  may be necessary to protect our  proprietary  technology.  This
litigation may be time-consuming  and expensive.  Despite our efforts to protect
our proprietary rights,  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our
products  or to obtain and use  information  that we regard as  proprietary.  In
addition,  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect  proprietary rights
to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.  We cannot assure you
that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our
competitors will not  independently  develop similar  technology,  duplicate our
products  or  design  around  any  patent  that  may be  issued  to us or  other
intellectual property rights of ours.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES.

     We may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or
technologies.  In addition,  we continually  evaluate the performance of all our
products  and  product  lines and may sell or  discontinue  current  products or
product lines. If we buy a company, we could have difficulty in integrating that
company's  personnel  and  operations.  In  addition,  the key  personnel of the
acquired  company  may  decide  not to work for us.  If we make  other  types of
acquisitions,  we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired  technology
or products into our operations.  These  difficulties  could disrupt our ongoing
business,  distract our  management  and  employees  and increase our  expenses.
Furthermore,  we may have to incur debt, write-off software development costs or
other assets, incur severance liabilities, amortize expenses related to goodwill
and other  intangible  assets or issue equity  securities  to pay for any future
acquisitions.  The  issuance  of equity  securities  could  dilute our  existing
stockholders' ownership.

     In addition,  potential acquisition  candidates targeted by us may not have
audited financial  statements,  detailed financial  information or any degree of
internal  controls.  There can be no assurance  that an audit  subsequent to any
successful completion of an acquisition will not reveal matters of significance,
including  issues  regarding  revenues,  expenses,  liabilities,  contingent  or
otherwise, and intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the Company
would  be  successful  in  overcoming  these  or  any  other  significant  risks
encountered  and the failure to do so could have a material  adverse effect upon
the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.

WE MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED TECHNICAL AND SALES PERSONNEL.

     Our  continued  success  depends,  in part,  on our  ability  to  identify,
attract,  motivate and retain  qualified  technical,  sales and other personnel.
Because our future  success is  dependent  on our ability to continue to enhance
and  introduce  new products,  we are  particularly  dependent on our ability to
identify,  attract,  motivate and retain qualified  engineers with the requisite
education,  backgrounds  and  industry  experience.  Competition  for  qualified
engineers,  particularly in Northern  California and the San Francisco Bay Area,
is intense. The loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or
sales  people  could  be  disruptive  to our  development  efforts  or  business
relationships and could seriously harm our business.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We  considered  the  provision  of  Financial   Reporting  Release  No.  48
"Disclosure of Accounting  Policies for  Derivative  Financial  Instruments  and
Derivative Commodity Instruments, and Disclosure of Quantitative and Qualitative
Information  about Market Risk  Inherent in  Derivative  Financial  Instruments,
Other  Financial  Instruments  and  Derivative  Commodity  Instruments".  We are
exposed to  financial  market  risks,  including  changes  in  foreign  currency
exchange rates and interest rates.  Much of our revenue and capital  spending is
transacted in U.S.  dollars.  However,  since the formation of Advent Australia,
Pty. Ltd., (Advent Australia) whose revenues and capital spending are transacted
in Australian dollars we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
Results of  operations  from Advent  Australia are not material to our operating
results,  therefore,  we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not
materially   adversely  affect  our  overall  financial  position,   results  of
operations  or cash  flows.  We believe  that the fair  value of our  investment
portfolio or related income would not be significantly  impacted by increases or
decreases  in  interest  rates  due  mainly  to  the  short-term  nature  of our
investment  portfolio.  However, a sharp increase in interest rates could have a
material  adverse  affect  on  the  fair  value  of  our  investment  portfolio.
Conversely,  sharp  declines in interest  rates could  seriously  harm  interest
earnings of our investment portfolio.

     The table below presents  principal  amounts by expected  maturity (in U.S.
dollars) and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our
investment portfolio.

         II.1     PLACE OF MEETINGS

         Meetings of  stockholders  shall be held at any place within or outside

executive office of the corporation.

        The annual  meeting of  stockholders  shall be held each year on a date

holiday,  then the meeting  shall be held at the same time and place on the next
succeeding full business day. At the meeting,  directors  shall be elected,  and
any other proper business may be transacted.

         II.3     SPECIAL MEETING

         A special meeting of the  stockholders may be called at any time by the
board of directors,  or by the chairman of the board,  or by the chief executive

         II.4     NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

         All  notices of  meetings of  stockholders  shall be sent or  otherwise

special  meeting,  the purpose or  purposes  for which the meeting is called (no
business  other than that  specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in
the case of the annual meeting,  those matters which the board of directors,  at
the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders
(but any proper  matter may be  presented at the meeting for such  action).  The
notice of any meeting at which  directors  are to be elected  shall  include the
name of any  nominee  or  nominees  who,  at the time of the  notice,  the board
intends to present for election.

         II.5    ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES AND STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS

         To be properly  brought  before an annual  meeting or special  meeting,

direction of the board of directors  or other person so  authorized  pursuant to
Section 2.3 of these bylaws,  (b) otherwise  properly brought before the meeting
by or at the  direction  of the board of  directors  or (c)  otherwise  properly
brought  before the  meeting by a  stockholder.  For such  nominations  or other
business to be considered  properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder,
such  stockholder must have given timely notice and in proper form of his intent
to bring such business  before such meeting.  To be timely,  such  stockholder's
notice  must be  delivered  to or mailed and  received by the  secretary  of the
Corporation not less than 90 days prior to the meeting; provided,  however, that
in the case of a meeting called by or on behalf of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation  where prior notice,  or public  disclosure,  of the meeting has not
been  given or made at least  100 days  prior  to such  meeting,  notice  by the
stockholder  to be  timely  must be so  received  not  later  than the  close of
business on the tenth day  following the day on which such notice of the date of
the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. To be in proper form,
a stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth:

                  make the nominations,  propose the business,  and, as the case
                  may be,  the name and  address  of the person or persons to be
                  nominated or the nature of the business to be proposed;

                  (ii) a  representation  that the  stockholder  is a holder  of
                  record of stock of the  Corporation  entitled  to vote at such
                  meeting and, if applicable,  intends to appear in person or by
                  proxy  at the  meeting  to  nominate  the  person  or  persons
                  specified in the notice or introduce the business specified in
                  the notice;

                  (iii) if  applicable,  a description  of all  arrangements  or
                  understandings  between the  stockholder  and each nominee and
                  any other  person or persons  (naming  such person or persons)
                  pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made
                  by the stockholder;

                  (iv) such other  information  regarding  each  nominee or each
                  matter of business to be proposed by such stockholder as would
                  be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant
                  to the proxy rules of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
                  had the nominee been  nominated,  or intended to be nominated,
                  or the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed by the
                  board of directors' and

                  (v) if  applicable,  the  consent  of each  nominee  to  serve
                  as  director  of the Corporation if so elected.

         The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of
any person or the  proposal  of any  business  not made in  compliance  with the
foregoing procedure.

         II.6     MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE

         Written  notice of any meeting of  stockholders  shall be given  either
personally  or  by   first-class   mail  or  by  telegraphic  or  other  written
communication.  Notices not personally  delivered  shall be sent charges prepaid
and shall be addressed  to the  stockholder  at the address of that  stockholder
appearing on the books of the  corporation  or given by the  stockholder  to the
corporation for the purpose of notice. Notice shall be deemed to have been given
at the  time  when  delivered  personally  or  deposited  in the mail or sent by
telegram or other means of written communication.

         An  affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any
stockholders'  meeting,  executed by the secretary,  assistant  secretary or any
transfer  agent of the  corporation  giving  the  notice,  shall be prima  facie
evidence of the giving of such notice.

         II.7     QUORUM

         The  holders  of a  majority  in voting  power of the stock  issued and
outstanding  and entitled to vote thereat,  present in person or  represented by
proxy,  shall  constitute a quorum at all meetings of the  stockholders  for the
transaction  of  business  except as  otherwise  provided  by  statute or by the
certificate  of  incorporation.  If,  however,  such  quorum is not  present  or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders,  then either (i) the chairman of
the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or represented  by proxy,  shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance
with Section 2.8 of these bylaws.

         When a quorum is present at any  meeting,  the vote of the holders of a
majority of the stock having  voting power present in person or  represented  by
proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question
is one upon which, by express  provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or
of the  certificate  of  incorporation  or these  bylaws,  a  different  vote is
required,  in which case such  express  provision  shall  govern and control the
decision of the question.

         If a quorum be  initially  present,  the  stockholders  may continue to
transact business until  adjournment,  notwithstanding  the withdrawal of enough
stockholders  to leave less than a quorum,  if any action taken is approved by a
majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.

         II.8     ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE

         When a meeting is  adjourned  to another  time and place,  unless these
bylaws otherwise  require,  notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if
the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken.  At the adjourned  meeting the  corporation  may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original  meeting.  If the adjournment is
for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the  adjourned  meeting,  a notice of the  adjourned  meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

         II.9     VOTING

         The stockholders  entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall
be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws,
subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law
of  Delaware  (relating  to voting  rights of  fiduciaries,  pledgors  and joint
owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).

         Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation
or these bylaws,  each stockholder  shall be entitled to one vote for each share
of capital stock held by such stockholder.

<PAGE>


         II.10    STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING

         Any action  required or  permitted to be taken at any annual or special
meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing  setting forth the action so
taken shall be signed by the holders of  outstanding  stock having not less than
the minimum  number of votes that would be  necessary  to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares  entitled to vote  thereon  were present
and voted. Such consents shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to it
registered office in the state of Delaware,  its principal place of business, or
an  officer  or agent of the  corporation  having  custody  of the book in which
proceedings  of  meetings  of  stockholders  are  recorded.  Delivery  made to a
corporation's  registered  office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested.

         II.11    RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING

         For purposes of determining the stockholders  entitled to notice of any
meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record
date,  which  shall not precede  the date upon which the  resolution  fixing the
record  date is adopted by the board of  directors  and which  shall not be more
than  sixty  (60) days nor less than ten (10) days  before  the date of any such
meeting,  and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are
entitled to notice and to vote,  notwithstanding  any  transfer of any shares on
the books of the corporation after the record date.

         If the board of  directors  does not so fix a record  date,  the record
date for determining  stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting
of  stockholders  shall be at the close of  business  on the  business  day next
preceding  the day on which  notice is given,  or, if notice is  waived,  at the
close of  business  on the  business  day next  preceding  the day on which  the
meeting is held.

         A  determination  of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders  shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting
unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting,
but the  board of  directors  shall  fix a new  record  date if the  meeting  is
adjourned  for more than  thirty  (30)  days from the date set for the  original
meeting.

         The record date for any other  purpose  shall be as provided in Section
8.1 of these bylaws.

         II.12    PROXIES

        Every person  entitled to vote for  directors,  or on any other matter,
shall  have  the  right  to do so  either  in  person  or by one or more  agents
authorized  by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary
of the  corporation,  but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three
(3) years from its date,  unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy
shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether
by manual signature,  typewriting,  telegraphic  transmission,  telefacsimile or
otherwise)  by  the  stockholder  or  the  stockholder's  attorney-


                                       5
<PAGE>

in-fact.  The  revocability  of a  proxy  that  states  on its  face  that it is
irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware.

         II.13    ORGANIZATION

         The  chairman  of the board,  or in the  absence of the  chairman,  the
president, shall call the meeting of the stockholders to order, and shall act as
chairman  of the  meeting.  In the  absence of the  chairman  of the board,  the
president,  and all of the vice  presidents,  the  stockholders  shall appoint a
chairman for such  meeting.  The chairman of any meeting of  stockholders  shall
determine  the order of business and the  procedures  at the meeting,  including
such  matters  as the  regulation  of the  manner of voting  and the  conduct of
business.  The  secretary  of the  corporation  shall  act as  secretary  of all
meetings of the stockholders, but in the absence of the secretary at any meeting
of the  stockholders,  the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act
as secretary of the meeting.

         II.14    LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE

         The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders  entitled to vote at the meeting,  arranged in
alphabetical  order,  and showing the address of each stockholder and the number
of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to
the  examination  of any  stockholder,  for any purpose  germane to the meeting,
during ordinary  business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to
the meeting,  either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held,
which  place  shall be  specified  in the notice of the  meeting,  or, if not so
specified,  at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be
produced  and kept at the time and place of the  meeting  during  the whole time
thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

                                    DIRECTORS

         III.1    POWERS

         Subject to the  provisions of the General  Corporation  Law of Delaware
and to any  limitations  in the  certificate  of  incorporation  or these bylaws
relating  to  action  required  to be  approved  by the  stockholders  or by the
outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed
and all  corporate  powers shall be  exercised by or under the  direction of the
board of directors.

<PAGE>

         III.2    NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

         The board of directors shall consist of six (6) members.  The number of
directors  may be changed by an  amendment  to this bylaw,  duly  adopted by the
board of directors or by the stockholders, or by a duly adopted amendment to the
certificate of incorporation.

         III.3    ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS

         Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws,  directors  shall be
elected at each annual  meeting of  stockholders  to hold office  until the next
annual meeting. Each director, including a director elected or appointed to fill
a vacancy,  shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected
and until a successor has been elected and qualified.

         III.4    RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES

         Any  director  may resign  effective  on giving  written  notice to the
chairman of the board,  the president,  the secretary or the board of directors,
unless  the  notice  specifies  a later  time for  that  resignation  to  become
effective.  If the  resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the

director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of
the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares  represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which
a quorum is  present  (which  shares  voting  affirmatively  also  constitute  a
majority of the required  quorum).  Each  director so elected  shall hold office
until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been
elected and qualified.

stockholders  having  the  right to vote as a single  class  may be  filled by a
majority of the directors then in office,  although less than a quorum,  or by a
sole remaining director.

                  (ii)  Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or
series  thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of
the certificate of incorporation,  vacancies and newly created  directorships of
such class or classes  or series  may be filled by a majority  of the  directors
elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office,  or by a sole
remaining director so elected.

corporation  should  have no  directors  in  office,  then  any  officer  or any
stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder,
or other fiduciary  entrusted with like  responsibility for the person or estate

the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply
to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided
in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

         If,  at  the  time  of  filling  any  vacancy  or  any  newly   created
directorship,  the directors then in office  constitute  less than a majority of
the whole board (as constituted  immediately  prior to any such increase),  then
the Court of Chancery may, upon  application of any  stockholder or stockholders
holding at least ten (10)  percent of the total number of the shares at the time
outstanding  having  the right to vote for such  directors,  summarily  order an
election to be held to fill any such  vacancies or newly created  directorships,

which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.

of directors  as provided in Section  151(a) of the General  Corporation  Law of
Delaware,  fix the  designations  and any of the  preferences  or rights of such

assets of the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares
for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any

incorporation  expressly so provide,  no such committee  shall have the power or
authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt
a  certificate  of ownership  and merger  pursuant to Section 253 of the General

                                AND OTHER AGENTS

         VI.1     INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

         The  corporation  shall,  to the  maximum  extent  and  in  the  manner
permitted by the General  Corporation  Law of Delaware as the same now exists or
may  hereafter be amended,  indemnify  any person  against  expenses  (including
attorneys' fees), judgments,  fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably  incurred in  connection  with any  threatened,  pending or completed
action,  suit,  or  proceeding  in  which  such  person  was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the  corporation.  For  purposes of this  Section  6.1, a
"director" or "officer" of the  corporation  shall mean any person (i) who is or
was a director or officer of the corporation,  (ii) who is or was serving at the
request  of the  corporation  as a director  or officer of another  corporation,
partnership,  joint  venture,  trust or  other  enterprise,  or (iii)  who was a
director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor  corporation of the
corporation  or of  another  enterprise  at  the  request  of  such  predecessor
corporation.

                                       16
<PAGE>


         The corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in
connection  with an action,  suit, or proceeding (or part thereof)  initiated by
such  director  or officer  only if the  initiation  of such  action,  suit,  or
proceeding  (or part  thereof) by the director or officer was  authorized by the
board of Directors of the corporation.

         The  corporation  shall pay the expenses  (including  attorney's  fees)
incurred by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification
hereunder  in  defending  any  action,  suit or  proceeding  referred to in this
Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment
of expenses  incurred by a director or officer of the  corporation in advance of
the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an  undertaking  by the  director  or  officer  to repay all  amounts
advanced if it should  ultimately be determined  that the director or officer is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.

         The  rights  conferred  on any  person  by this  Article  shall  not be
exclusive of any other  rights  which such person may have or hereafter  acquire
under any statute,  provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation,
these bylaws,  agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise.

         Any repeal or modification of the foregoing  provisions of this Article
shall not adversely  affect any right or  protection  hereunder of any person in
respect of any act or  omission  occurring  prior to the time of such  repeal or
modification.

         VI.2     INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS

         The corporation  shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the
manner  permitted  by the  General  Corporation  Law of Delaware as the same now
exists or may  hereafter  be  amended,  to  indemnify  any  person  (other  than
directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines,  and amounts  paid in  settlement  actually  and  reasonably  incurred in
connection  with  any  threatened,   pending  or  completed  action,   suit,  or
proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party by reason of the fact that such  person is or was an  employee or agent of
the  corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of
the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who
is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at
the request of the  corporation as an employee or agent of another  corporation,
partnership,  joint  venture,  trust or other  enterprise,  or (iii)  who was an
employee or agent of a corporation  which was a predecessor  corporation  of the
corporation  or of  another  enterprise  at  the  request  of  such  predecessor
corporation.

<PAGE>
         VI.3     INSURANCE

         The  corporation  may purchase and maintain  insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director,  officer, employee or agent of the corporation,
or is or was serving at the request of the  corporation as a director,  officer,
employee or agent of another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust or
other enterprise  against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred
by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,
whether  or not the  corporation  would have the power to  indemnify  him or her
against such liability  under the provisions of the General  Corporation  Law of
Delaware.

         VI.4     SAVINGS CLAUSE

         If this Article VI or any portion  thereof shall be  invalidated on any
ground  by any  court of  competent  jurisdiction,  then the  corporation  shall
nevertheless  indemnify  each  director,  officer,  employee  or  agent  of  the
corporation against expenses (including attorney's fees),  judgments,  fines and
amounts paid in  settlement  with  respect to any action,  suit,  proceeding  or
investigation,  whether civil, criminal or administrative,  and whether internal
or external,  including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by
or in the  right  of  the  corporation,  to the  full  extent  permitted  by any
applicable  portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated,  or by
any other applicable law.

         VI.5     CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF   EXPENSES

         The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VI shall,  unless  otherwise prided when authorized or
ratified,  continue  as to a person  who has ceased to be a  director,  officer,
employee  or agent and shall inure to the  benefit of the heirs,  executors  and
administrators of such a person.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                               RECORDS AND REPORTS

         VII.1    MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS

         The corporation shall,  either at its principal  executive office or at
such place or places as designated  by the board of directors,  keep a record of
its  stockholders  listing their names and addresses and the number and class of
shares  held by each  stockholder,  a copy of these  bylaws as  amended to date,
accounting books and other records of its business and properties.

         Any  stockholder  of record,  in person or by attorney or other  agent,
shall,  upon written  demand under oath  stating the purpose  thereof,  have the
right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper  purpose the
corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders,  and its other books

                                       18
<PAGE>

and records and to make copies or extracts  therefrom.  A proper  purpose  shall
mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In
every  instance  where an  attorney  or other  agent is the person who seeks the
right to  inspection,  the demand under oath shall be  accompanied by a power of
attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so
act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the
corporation  at its registered  office in Delaware or at its principal  place of
business.

         VII.2    INSPECTION BY DIRECTORS

         Any director  shall have the right to examine the  corporation's  stock
ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose
reasonably related to his or her position as a director.

         VII.3    ANNUAL STATEMENT TO STOCKHOLDERS

         The board of directors shall present at each annual meeting, and at any
special meeting of the stockholders when called for by vote of the stockholders,
a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the corporation.

         VII.4    REPRESENTATION OF SHARES OF OTHER CORPORATIONS

         The chairman of the board,  if any, the president,  any vice president,
the chief financial  officer,  the secretary or any assistant  secretary of this
corporation,  or any other  person  authorized  by the board of directors or the
president or a vice president,  is authorized to vote, represent and exercise on
behalf of this  corporation  all  rights  incident  to any and all shares of the
stock of any other  corporation  or  corporations  standing  in the name of this
corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person
directly  or by any  other  person  authorized  to do so by  proxy  or  power of
attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.

         VII.5    CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF BYLAWS

         The original or a copy of these bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered
to  date,  certified  by the  secretary,  shall  be  kept  at the  corporation's

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                 GENERAL MATTERS

         VIII.1   RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING

         For  purposes  of  determining  the  stockholders  entitled  to receive
payment of any dividend or other  distribution or allotment of any rights or the
stockholders  entitled  to  exercise  any  rights  in  respect  of  any  change,
conversion or exchange of stock,  or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the board of  directors  may fix, in  advance,  a record  date,  which shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and
which  shall not be more than sixty (60) days  before any such  action.  In that
case, only  stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed
are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to
exercise such rights,  as the case may be,  notwithstanding  any transfer of any
shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as
otherwise provided by law.

         If the  board of  directors  does not so fix a  record  date,  then the
record date for  determining  stockholders  for any such purpose shall be at the
close  of  business  on the day on  which  the  board of  directors  adopts  the
applicable resolution.

         VIII.2   CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS

         From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution
which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for
payment of money,  notes or other evidences of  indebtedness  that are issued in
the name of or payable to the  corporation,  and only the persons so  authorized
shall sign or endorse those instruments.

         VIII.3   CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED

         The board of directors,  except as otherwise  provided in these bylaws,
may authorize and empower any officer or officers,  or agent or agents, to enter
into any contract or execute any  instrument in the name of and on behalf of the
corporation;  such power and  authority  may be general or  confined to specific
instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within
the agency  power of an officer,  no officer,  agent or employee  shall have any
power or authority to bind the  corporation  by any contract or engagement or to
pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.

         VIII.4   STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES

         The shares of the  corporation  shall be represented  by  certificates,
provided  that  the  board  of  directors  of the  corporation  may  provide  by
resolution  or  resolutions  that some or all of any or all classes or series of
its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to
shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
corporation.  Notwithstanding  the adoption of such a resolution by the board of
directors,  every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request,
every holder of uncertificated  shares,  shall be entitled to have a certificate
signed by, or in the name of the corporation  by, the chairman or  vice-chairman
of the  board of  directors,  or the  president  or  vice-president,  and by the
treasurer or an assistant



                                       20
<PAGE>

treasurer,  or the  secretary  or an  assistant  secretary  of such  corporation
representing the number of shares  registered in certificate form. Any or all of
the  signatures  on the  certificate  may be a  facsimile.  In case any officer,
transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been
placed  upon a  certificate  has ceased to be such  officer,  transfer  agent or
registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation
with the  same  effect  as if he or she were  such  officer,  transfer  agent or
registrar at the date of issue.

         Certificates  for shares  shall be of such form and device as the board
of directors  may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the
shares represented thereby;  its number; date of issuance;  the number of shares
for  which it is  issued;  a  summary  statement  or  reference  to the  powers,
designations,  preferences  or  other  special  rights  of  such  stock  and the
qualifications,  limitations or restrictions of such preferences  and/or rights,
if any;  a  statement  or  summary of liens,  if any;  a  conspicuous  notice of
restrictions  upon transfer or registration of transfer,  if any; a statement as
to any applicable  voting trust agreement;  if the shares be assessable,  or, if
assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.

         Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of
a certificate  for shares duly  endorsed or  accompanied  by proper  evidence of
succession,  assignment  or authority  to transfer,  it shall be the duty of the
corporation to issue a new  certificate to the person entitled  thereto,  cancel
the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.

         The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly
paid and  subject  to call for the  remainder  of the  consideration  to be paid
therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock  certificate  issued to represent
any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in
the  case  of  uncertificated  partly  paid  shares,  the  total  amount  of the
consideration  to be paid  therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.
Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall
declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class,  but only upon the
basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

         VIII.5   SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES

         If the  corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock
or more than one series of any class,  then the powers,  the  designations,  the
preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
each class of stock or series  thereof and the  qualifications,  limitations  or
restrictions  of such  preferences  and/or  rights shall be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of the  certificate  that the  corporation  shall
issue to  represent  such  class or series of stock;  provided,  however,  that,
except as otherwise  provided in Section 202 of the General  Corporation  Law of
Delaware,  in lieu of the foregoing  requirements  there may be set forth on the
face or back of the certificate  that the  corporation  shall issue to represent
such class or series of stock a  statement  that the  corporation  will  furnish
without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations,
the  preferences  and the  relative,  participating,  optional or other  special
rights  of each


                                       21
<PAGE>

class  of  stock  or  series  thereof  and the  qualifications,  limitations  or
restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

         VIII.6   LOST CERTIFICATES

         Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new  certificates for shares
shall be issued to replace a previously issued  certificate unless the latter is
surrendered  to the  corporation  and  cancelled at the same time.  The board of
directors  may,  in case any  share  certificate  or  certificate  for any other
security is lost,  stolen or destroyed,  authorize  the issuance of  replacement
certificates  on such terms and  conditions as the board may require;  the board
may  require  indemnification  of the  corporation  secured  by a bond or  other
adequate security  sufficient to protect the corporation  against any claim that
may be made against it,  including any expense or  liability,  on account of the
alleged loss,  theft or  destruction  of the  certificate or the issuance of the
replacement certificate.

         VIII.7   TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS

         The board of  directors  may  appoint  one or more  transfer  agents or
transfer  clerks,  and  one or  more  registrars,  each  of  which  shall  be an
incorporated  bank or trust company -- either domestic or foreign,  who shall be
appointed at such times and places as the  requirements  of the  corporation may
necessitate and the board of directors may designate.

         VIII.8   CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS

         Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of
construction  and  definitions in the General  Corporation Law of Delaware shall
govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this
provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the
plural  number  includes the singular,  and the term  "person"  includes both an
entity and a natural person.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   AMENDMENTS

         The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended
or repealed by the stockholders  entitled to vote; provided,  however,  that the
corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt,
amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.  The fact that such power has been so
conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor
limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.


                                       22
<PAGE>


         Whenever an  amendment  or new bylaw is adopted,  it shall be copied in
the book of bylaws with the original  bylaws,  in the appropriate  place. If any
bylaw is repealed,  the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the
repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative  written  consent(s)  shall be
stated in said book.

or demand,  and  without  any  set-off,  counterclaim,  abatement  or  deduction
whatsoever,  except as may be expressly set forth in this Lease, in lawful money

                                    ARTICLE 3

                                USE AND OCCUPANCY

     Section 3.1 (a)  Permitted  Uses.  Tenant shall use and occupy the Premises
for the Permitted Uses and for no other purpose.  Tenant shall not use or occupy
or  permit  the  use or  occupancy  of any  part  of the  Premises  in a  manner
constituting a Prohibited Use. If Tenant uses or suffers the use of the Premises
for a purpose which constitutes a Prohibited Use or violates any Requirement, or
which causes the Building to be in  violation  of any  Requirement,  then Tenant
shall  promptly  discontinue  such use upon notice of such  violation.  Tenant's
failure to  promptly  (and,  in all  events,  within 10 days after such  notice)
discontinue  such use shall be a material  default  hereunder and Landlord shall
have the right,  without  Tenant having any further period in which to cure, (i)
to terminate this Lease immediately, and (ii) to exercise any and all rights and
remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity.

                 (b) Licenses and Permits. Tenant, at its expense, shall obtain
and at all times  maintain  and  comply  with the terms  and  conditions  of all
licenses and permits  required for the lawful  conduct of the Permitted  Uses in
the Premises.  Landlord  represents that the certificate of occupancy issued for
the  Building  permits the use of the Premises as offices.  Landlord  shall not,
without Tenant's approval, amend during the Term the certificate of occupancy in
effect for the Building to (i) change the use provided  therein of the floors of
the  Building  where the  Premises are located in respect of the Premises if the
effect of such change would prevent  Tenant from using the Premises for offices,
(ii)  reduce  the  permitted  floor load  provided  therein of the floors of the
Building  where the Premises are located,  or (iii) reduce the number of persons
permitted  therein to occupy any floor of the  Building  where the  Premises are
located.

     Section 3.2 Delivery of Premises. (a) Landlord shall not be liable for
failure to deliver  possession of the Premises on any specified  date,  and such
failure  shall not impair the  validity  of the Lease.  Landlord  shall  provide
Tenant  with at  least 10  Business  Days'  prior  notice  of the date  Landlord
reasonably  anticipates  will be the  Construction  Period Start Date.  Landlord
shall be deemed to have delivered  possession of the Premises to Tenant upon the
giving of notice by Landlord to Tenant stating that the Premises are vacant,  in
the condition  required under this Lease, and available for Tenant's  occupancy.
There shall be no  postponement  of the  Construction  Period Start Date (or the
Rent  Commencement  Date) for (i) any delay in the delivery of possession of the
Premises  to Tenant  which  results  from any Tenant  Delay or (ii) any delay by
Landlord in the performance of any Punch List Items relating to Landlord's Work.
Landlord shall complete such Punch List Items, of which Tenant notifies Landlord
within 10 days after Substantial Completion of the applicable work in connection
therewith,  and remedy any latent defects in Landlord's  Work which Tenant could
not with  reasonable  diligence  have  discovered  when  Landlord  delivered the
Premises to Tenant,  of which Tenant  notifies  Landlord  within 12 months after
Substantial Completion of the applicable work in connection therewith, within 60
days after Tenant gives Landlord any such notice. The provisions of this Section
3.2 are intended to constitute "an express provision to the contrary" within the
meaning  of Section  223-a of the New York Real  Property  Law or any  successor
Requirement.

     (b) If  Landlord  fails to  Substantially  Complete  Landlord's  Work on or
before March 1, 2000,  which date shall be subject to  extension  for any Tenant
Delay and Unavoidable  Delay,  then, as Tenant's  exclusive  remedy with respect
thereto other than as provided in Section  3.2(c) below,  Tenant shall receive a
credit  (without  duplication  if more than one item of  Landlord's  Work is not
Substantially  Complete)  of $1,999.74  per day to be applied  against the first
installments   of  Fixed  Rent  payable   hereunder,   commencing  on  the  Rent
Commencement  Date,  for each day in the period  commencing on March 1, 2000 (as
extended by Tenant Delay and Unavoidable Delay) and ending on the date all items
of Landlord's Work are Substantially Complete.

     (c) If  Landlord  is unable  for any reason to  deliver  possession  of the
Premises with the Landlord's Work (other than item 8) Substantially  Complete on
or before  September 1, 2000,  as extended by  Unavoidable  Delays (the "Outside
Delivery  Date"),  Tenant  shall have the right within 30 days after the Outside
Delivery Date, as its sole and exclusive remedy  therefor,  to cancel this Lease
by giving notice of  cancellation  to Landlord.  If Tenant  timely  delivers the
aforesaid cancellation notice, this Lease shall terminate 30 days after the date
of such notice,  unless Landlord  delivers vacant  possession of the Premises in
the condition  required by this Lease within such 30-day  period,  in which case
Tenant's cancellation notice shall be void and this Lease shall continue in full
force and effect.  Failure by Tenant to exercise such right to cancel this Lease
within such 30-day period shall constitute a waiver of such right; time being of
the essence with respect thereto.

     Section 3.3 Use of Building Name or Image.  Neither Tenant nor any occupant
of the Premises shall use CHRYSLER EAST BUILDING, CHRYSLER CENTER or CHRYSLER or
any other name for the  Premises as  designated  by  Landlord or any  variation,
abbreviation  (including  initials),  or simulation thereof, or any depiction or
rendering  of  any  recognizable  feature  of the  Building,  for  any  purposes
whatsoever,  including for any corporate, firm or trade name, trademark, service
mark or other designation of the source or origin of merchandise or services, or
which  otherwise  implies  affiliation  with, or  endorsement  or sponsorship by
Landlord. However, the foregoing shall not prevent Tenant or any other permitted
occupant of the Premises from using CHRYSLER EAST BUILDING OR CHRYSLER CENTER in
a  descriptive  or  geographically  descriptive  manner and without  emphasis or
display, as part of Tenant's or such permitted occupant's business address or as
a geographic  reference to the location of Tenant or such permitted  occupant in
the ordinary course of its business, in the form "at the Chrysler East Building"
or "at the Chrysler Center."


                                    ARTICLE 4

Landlord nor Landlord's agents have made any  representations or warranties with
respect to the Premises or the Building  except as expressly  set forth  herein,

Section 4.2 hereof and except for  Landlord's  Work  described  in Section  4.3,

expense or make any  alterations or  improvements to the Premises to prepare the
Premises  for  Tenant's  occupancy.  Any  work  to be  performed  by  Tenant  in
connection with Tenant's initial  occupancy of the Premises shall be referred to
hereinafter as the "Initial  Installations".  Tenant's  occupancy of any part of
the  Premises  for the  conduct of its  ordinary  business  shall be  conclusive
evidence, as against Tenant, that Landlord has Substantially  Completed any work
to be performed by Landlord under this Lease,  Tenant has accepted possession of
the Premises in its then current  condition and at the time such  possession was
taken,  the Premises  were in a good and  satisfactory  condition as required by

as provided in Section 3.2(a).

     Section 4.2 Landlord's  Contribution.  (a) Landlord agrees to pay to Tenant

engineering,  permit and construction consulting fees not in excess of $119,172)
and  Tenant's  Property  (other  than the cost of  Tenant's  moveable  walls and
partitions)), provided that as of the date on which Landlord is

                                       6

required to make payment thereof  pursuant to Section 4.2(b):  (i) this Lease is
in full force and effect, and (ii) no Event of Default then exists. Accordingly,
Tenant may use any amount of  Landlord's  Contribution  to purchase  and install
moveable  walls  and  partitions.  Tenant  shall  pay all  costs of the  Initial
Installations  in excess of  Landlord's  Contribution.  Landlord's  Contribution
shall be  payable  solely on account of labor  directly  related to the  Initial
Installations  and materials  delivered to the Premises in  connection  with the
Initial  Installations  (excluding  any "soft costs" (other than  architectural,
engineering,  permit and construction consulting fees not in excess of $119,172)
and  Tenant's  Property  (other  than the cost of  Tenant's  moveable  walls and
partitions)).  Tenant shall not be entitled to receive any portion of Landlord's
Contribution  not actually  expended by Tenant in the performance of the Initial
Installations  in  accordance  with this  Section 4.2, nor shall Tenant have any
right to apply any  unexpended  portion of Landlord's  Contribution  as a credit
against Rent or any other obligation of Tenant hereunder. Upon the completion of
the Initial  Installations  and satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this
Section 4.2, any amount of Landlord's Contribution which has not been previously
disbursed shall be retained by Landlord; provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything  contained  herein to the  contrary,  the  applicable  portion  of such
retained amounts shall continue to be held for the benefit of Tenant by Landlord
if Tenant  delivers a notice to Landlord prior to satisfaction of the conditions
set  forth in this  Section  4.2  that it is in  dispute  with any  contractors,
subcontractors,  vendors  or other  providers  of  service  and  refuses to make
payments at such time or if any contracts  provide for  retainage  which has not
then been finally paid.

     (b) Landlord  shall pay Landlord's  Contribution  to Tenant after the first
anniversary of the Rent  Commencement  Date following  commencement  of Tenant's
business  operations  at the  Premises and the final  completion  of the Initial
Installations,  within 30 days  after  submission  by Tenant  to  Landlord  of a
written  requisition  therefor,  signed by the chief financial officer of Tenant
and  accompanied  by (i) copies of paid  invoices  covering  all of the  Initial
Installations, (ii) a written certification from Tenant's architect stating that
(A) the Initial Installations  described on such invoices have been completed in
accordance with the plans and specifications approved by Landlord, (B) such work
has been  paid in full by Tenant  and (C) all  contractors,  subcontractors  and
material suppliers have delivered to Tenant waivers of lien with respect to such
work (copies of which shall be included  with such  architect's  certification),
(iii) proof of the satisfactory  completion of all required  inspections and the
issuance of any required  approvals  and sign-offs by  Governmental  Authorities
with respect thereto,  (iv) final "as-built"  plans and  specifications  for the
Initial  Installations  as required  pursuant to Section 5.1(c),  (v) final lien
waivers from all contractors, subcontractors and material suppliers covering all
of the Initial  Installations,  and (vi) such other documents and information as
Landlord may reasonably request, including title drawdowns and endorsements. The
right to receive Landlord's Contribution is for the exclusive benefit of Tenant,
and in no event shall such right be assigned to or be  enforceable by or for the
benefit  of  any  third  party,   including   any   contractor,   subcontractor,
materialman, laborer, architect, engineer, attorney or other Person.

     Section 4.3 Landlord's Work. Landlord will commence the performance of
the  work  described  in  Exhibit  C  ("Landlord's  Work")  reasonably  promptly
following  the  date  hereof  and,  subject  to  Tenant's  compliance  with  the
provisions  of this  Section  4.3,  will  Substantially  Complete,  at its  sole
expense,  Landlord's Work in a good and workmanlike  manner  consistent with the
standards applicable to the Building prior to the Construction Period Start Date
other than in the case of item 8 thereof, which item of Landlord's Work shall be
Substantially  Completed  prior to Tenant's  occupancy  of the  Premises for the
conduct of its  business.  Landlord and its  employees,  contractors  and agents
shall have access to the Premises at all reasonable times for the performance of
Landlord's  Work  and  for the  storage  of  materials  reasonably  required  in
connection therewith, and Tenant will use all commercially reasonable efforts to
avoid any interference  with the performance of Landlord's Work.  Landlord shall
use reasonable efforts to minimize  interference with Tenant's use and occupancy
of the Premises  during the performance of item 8 of Landlord's  Work,  provided
that  Landlord  shall  have no  obligation  to  employ  contractors  or labor at
overtime  or other  premium  pay rates or to incur any other  overtime  costs or
additional expenses whatsoever. There shall be no Rent abatement or allowance to
Tenant for a diminution of rental value, no actual or  constructive  eviction of
Tenant,  in whole or in part, no relief from any of Tenant's  other  obligations
under  this  Lease,  and no  liability  on the part of  Landlord,  by  reason of
inconvenience,  annoyance or injury to business  arising from the performance of
such item of  Landlord's  Work or the  storage of any  materials  in  connection
therewith.

applicable  to the  facade,  lobby and the floors of the  Building  on which the
Premises  are  located  in a good and  workmanlike  manner  consistent  with the
standards  applicable to the Building.  Landlord may make such  modifications to
the  Building  Work  as  Landlord,  in  its  sole  discretion,  deems  desirable
consistent with a first-class  renovated  building of comparable age and quality
in midtown Manhattan.

     (b) Redevelopment. Tenant hereby acknowledges that Landlord is redeveloping
the Building,  including but not limited to constructing  substantial additional
space on the 30th and 31st floors of the Building along with other floors of the
Building,  renovating  the lobby,  elevator cabs and  mechanical  systems of the
Building.  Tenant  understands and acknowledges  that there shall be substantial
noise and dust associated with such redevelopment.

     (c) Access.  Landlord and its employees,  contractors and agents shall have
access to the Premises at all times,  prior to the  occupancy of the Premises by
Tenant for the conduct of its ordinary business, for the performance of Building
Work and for the storage of  materials  required in  connection  therewith,  and
Tenant will use all  commercially  reasonable  efforts to avoid any interference
with the performance of the Building Work.  Landlord shall

                                       8
<PAGE>


use all commercially  reasonable efforts to minimize  interference with Tenant's
use and occupancy of the Premises  during the  performance of the Building Work,
provided that Landlord  shall have no obligation to employ  contractors or labor
at overtime or other premium pay rates or to incur any other  overtime  costs or
additional expenses  whatsoever.  Neither Landlord nor its agents or contractors
shall be liable for any damage (including damage resulting from lost business as
well as damage to Tenant's Personal Property) which Tenant may sustain resulting
from the Building Work.

                                   ALTERATIONS

     Section  5.1   Tenant's   Alterations.   (a)  Tenant  shall  not  make  any
alterations,  additions  or other  physical  changes  in or about the  Premises,
including the Initial Installations  (collectively,  "Alterations"),  other than
decorative  Alterations  such as painting,  wall  coverings and floor  coverings
(collectively,  "Decorative  Alterations"),  without  Landlord's  prior consent,
which  may be  withheld  in  Landlord's  sole  discretion.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  Landlord shall not unreasonably  withhold its consent to Alterations
so long as such Alterations (i) are  non-structural  and do not adversely affect
the  Building  Systems,   (ii)  are  performed  only  by  Landlord's  designated
contractors or by contractors  approved by Landlord to perform such Alterations,
(iii)  affect only the Premises and are not visible from outside of the Premises
or the Building,  (iv) do not affect the certificate of occupancy issued for the
Building or the Premises,  (v) do not adversely affect any service  furnished by
Landlord  to  Tenant  or to any other  tenant  of the  Building  and (vi) do not
violate  any   Requirement   or  cause  the  Premises  or  the  Building  to  be
non-compliant with any Requirement.

     (b) Plans and Specifications.  Prior to making any Alterations,  Tenant, at
its expense,  shall (i) submit to Landlord for its approval,  detailed plans and
specifications  (including  layout,   architectural,   mechanical,   electrical,
plumbing,  sprinkler and structural drawings) of each proposed Alteration (other
than Decorative  Alterations and alterations of such a scope that such plans and
specifications are not required by any Requirement and would not be customary in
accordance with good construction practice),  and with respect to any Alteration
affecting any Building System, Tenant shall submit proof that the Alteration has
been designed by, or reviewed and approved by,  Landlord's  designated  engineer
for the  affected  Building  System,  (ii)  obtain all  permits,  approvals  and
certificates required by any Governmental Authorities, (iii) furnish to Landlord
duplicate original policies or certificates of worker's  compensation  (covering
all  persons  to  be  employed  by  Tenant,   and   Tenant's   contractors   and
subcontractors  in  connection  with such  Alteration)  and  commercial  general
liability  (including  property  damage  coverage)  insurance and Builder's Risk
coverage  (issued  on a  completed  value  basis)  all in such  form,  with such
companies,  for such  periods  and in such  amounts as Landlord  may  reasonably
require, naming Landlord, Landlord's managing

                                       9

agent, and their respective  employees and agents,  any Lessor and any Mortgagee
of which Tenant has notice as  additional  insureds and (iv) furnish to Landlord
such other  evidence of Tenant's  ability to complete  and to fully pay for such
Alterations (other than Decorative Alterations) as is reasonably satisfactory to
Landlord. Upon Tenant's request, Landlord shall reasonably cooperate with Tenant
in obtaining any permits,  approvals or certificates  required to be obtained by
Tenant in connection  with any permitted  Alteration  (if the  provisions of the
applicable Requirement require that Landlord join in such application), provided
that Tenant  shall  reimburse  Landlord  for any cost,  expense or  liability in
connection therewith.  Tenant shall give Landlord not less than 5 Business Days'
notice prior to performing any Decorative  Alteration which notice shall contain
a description of such Decorative Alteration.  If Landlord shall deny any request
for approval to an  Alteration,  Landlord shall provide Tenant with a reasonably
detailed   explanation  of  the  reason(s)  for  such  denial.   Any  plans  and
specifications  resubmitted  by  Tenant  to  Landlord  for  Landlord's  approval
reflecting  changes  or  additions  made to such  plans  and  specifications  as
requested by Landlord ("Tenant's  Resubmission")  shall be approved or denied by
Landlord,  subject to Section 5.1(a),  within 5 Business Days following Tenant's
Resubmission. If Landlord shall fail to respond to Tenant's request for approval
to  Alterations  within 15 Business Days  following the  submission of final and
complete  plans and  specifications  thereof  (or within 5  Business  Days after
Tenant's Resubmission),  as applicable, Landlord shall be deemed to have granted
such  approval,  provided  Landlord fails to respond to Tenant within 5 Business
Days after receipt of a second notice from Tenant (which notice may only be sent
if  Landlord  failed to respond  within  said 15 or 5 Business  Day  period,  as
aforesaid, and such notice shall expressly state in bold letters that Landlord's
failure to timely respond  thereto shall be deemed  approval of the  Alterations
which are the subject of such notice).

     (c) Governmental Approvals. Upon completion of any
Alterations, Tenant, at its expense, shall promptly obtain certificates of final
approval of such Alterations  required by any  Governmental  Authority and shall
furnish  Landlord  with  copies  thereof,  together  with  "as-built"  plans and
specifications for such Alterations (other than Decorative Alterations) prepared
on an Autocad Computer Assisted Drafting and Design system (or such other system
or medium  as  Landlord  may  accept)  using  naming  conventions  issued by the
American  Institute of Architects in June, 1990 (or such other naming convention
as Landlord may accept) and magnetic  computer media of such record drawings and
specifications,  translated  in DXF  format  or  another  format  acceptable  to
Landlord.

     Section 5.2 Manner and Quality of  Alterations.  All  Alterations  shall be
performed (a) in a good and  workmanlike  manner and free from  defects,  (b) in
accordance with the plans and  specifications as required under Section 5.1, and
by  contractors  approved by Landlord,  (c) under the  supervision of a licensed
architect   reasonably   satisfactory   to  Landlord   (other  than   Decorative
Alterations),  and (d) in compliance  with all  Requirements,  the terms of this
Lease,  all standard  procedures and regulations then prescribed by Landlord for
all work  performed in the  Building.  All materials and equipment to be used in
the  Premises  shall be of first  quality and at least  equal to the  applicable
standards for the

                                       10
<PAGE>

Building then established by Landlord, and no such materials or equipment (other
than Tenant's Property) shall be subject to any lien or other encumbrance.

     Section 5.3 Removal of Tenant's  Property.  Tenant's  Property shall be and
remain the  property  of Tenant and Tenant may remove the same at any time on or
before  the  Expiration  Date.  On or prior  to the  Expiration  Date or  sooner
termination  of the Term,  Tenant  shall,  at  Tenant's  expense,  remove all of
Tenant's  Property and, unless  otherwise  directed by Landlord:  (a) remove any
Specialty  Alteration  and (b) close up any slab  penetrations  in the Premises.
Landlord  shall advise Tenant,  at the time of Landlord's  approval of the plans
and specifications  therefor,  as to whether Tenant will be required to remove a
Specialty  Alteration,  provided Tenant requests in writing (using bold letters)
that Landlord advise of such removal obligation with submittal of the applicable
plans and  specifications.  At least 30 days prior to commencing  the removal of
any  Specialty  Alterations  or  effecting  such  closings,  Tenant shall notify
Landlord of its intention to remove such  Specialty  Alterations  or effect such
closings,  and if Landlord  notifies  Tenant  within such 30 day period,  Tenant
shall not remove such Specialty Alterations or close such slab penetrations, and
the Specialty  Alterations  not so removed shall become the property of Landlord
upon the Expiration Date or sooner  termination of the Term. Tenant shall repair
and restore, in a good and workmanlike manner, any damage to the Premises or the
Building  caused by Tenant's  removal of any Specialty  Alterations  or Tenant's
Property or by the closing of any slab  penetrations,  and upon default thereof,
Tenant shall reimburse Landlord, on demand, for Landlord's cost of repairing and
restoring  such  damage.  Any  Specialty  Alterations  or Tenant's  Property not
removed on or before the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the Term shall
be deemed  abandoned  and  Landlord  may either  retain  the same as  Landlord's
property or remove and dispose of same, and repair and restore any damage caused
thereby, at Tenant's cost and without accountability to Tenant. This Section 5.3
shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

     Section 5.4 Mechanic's Liens.  Tenant, at its expense,  shall discharge any
lien or charge  filed  against the Premises or the Real  Property in  connection
with any work claimed or reasonably determined in good faith by Landlord to have
been done by or on behalf of, or materials  claimed or reasonably  determined in
good faith by Landlord to have been furnished to,  Tenant,  within 30 days after
Tenant's  receipt of notice thereof by payment,  filing the bond required by law
or otherwise in accordance with law.

     Section  5.5 Labor  Relations.  Tenant  shall  not  employ,  or permit  the
employment of, any contractor,  mechanic or laborer,  or permit any materials to
be delivered to or used in the Building,  if, in Landlord's sole judgment,  such
employment,  delivery or use will  interfere or cause any conflict or disharmony
with other  contractors,  mechanics  or  laborers  engaged in the  construction,
maintenance or operation of the Building by Landlord,  Tenant or others,  or the
use and enjoyment of the Building by other tenants or occupants. In the event of
such interference, conflict or disharmony, upon Landlord's request, Tenant shall
cause all

                                       11
<PAGE>

contractors,  mechanics  or laborers  causing such  interference  or conflict to
leave the Building immediately.

     Section 5.6 Tenant's  Costs.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord or its designee,
within  30 days  after  demand,  all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  costs  actually
incurred by Landlord in connection  with  Tenant's  Alterations  (including  the
Initial  Installations),   including  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  (a)
Landlord's review of the Alterations  (including review of requests for approval
thereof) and (b) the provision of Building  personnel  during the performance of
any Alteration required by trade union policy or otherwise, to operate elevators
or otherwise  to  facilitate  Tenant's  Alterations.  In  addition,  if Tenant's
Alterations  (other  than  the  Initial  Installations)  shall  cost  more  than
$100,000,  Tenant  shall  pay to  Landlord  or its  designee,  upon  demand,  an
administrative  fee in respect of the  performance of such  Alterations  and the
scheduling  of  Building  equipment,  facilities  and  personnel  in  connection
therewith equal to three percent of the total cost of such Alterations.

     Section 5.7 Tenant's Equipment.  Tenant shall not move any heavy machinery,
heavy equipment,  freight, bulky matter or fixtures (collectively,  "Equipment")
into or out of the Building  without  Landlord's  prior  consent,  which consent
shall  not be  unreasonably  withheld,  and  payment  to  Landlord  of any costs
incurred by Landlord in connection therewith. If such Equipment requires special
handling,  Tenant  agrees (a) to employ only persons  holding a Master  Rigger's
License to perform such work,  (b) all work  performed in  connection  therewith
shall comply with all  applicable  Requirements  and (c) such work shall be done
only during hours designated by Landlord.

     Section 5.8 Legal Compliance.  The approval of plans or specifications,  or
consent  by  Landlord  to the  making of any  Alterations,  does not  constitute
Landlord's  agreement  or  representation  that such  plans,  specifications  or
Alterations  comply with any Requirements or the certificate of occupancy issued
for the Building.  Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant or any other party
in connection with Landlord's  approval of any plans and  specifications for any
Alterations, or Landlord's consent to Tenant's performing any Alterations. If as
the  result  of any  Alterations  made by or on behalf of  Tenant,  Landlord  is
required to make any  alterations or improvements to any part of the Building in
order to comply with any  Requirements,  whether or not in or near the Premises,
Tenant shall pay all costs and expenses  incurred by Landlord in connection with
such alterations or improvements as provided in Article 20.

     Section 5.9 ICIP.  Landlord hereby notifies Tenant that Landlord intends to
avail itself of the Industrial and Commercial  Incentive  Program  ("ICIP").  In
connection  therewith,  all of Tenant's construction  managers,  contractors and
subcontractors  employed in connection  with  construction  work at the Building
shall be  contractually  required  by Tenant  to  comply  with the New York City
Department of Business Services/ Division of Labor Services ("DLS") requirements
applicable to construction  projects  benefiting from the ICIP. Such compliance,
as of the date hereof, includes the following:  the submission and approval

employment in the Premises,  the nature of each worker's  employment  and to the
extent  applicable,  the New York City  residency of each  worker,  (ii) provide
access to the Premises by employees and agents of the  Department  (as such term

     Section 7.2 Tenant's Repair and Maintenance.  Tenant shall promptly, at its
expense  and  in  compliance  with  Article  5  of  this  Lease,  (a)  make  all

foregoing,  but subject to the  provisions  of Section  12.2,  all damage to the
Premises or to any other part of the Building,  or to any  fixtures,  equipment,
sprinkler system and/or appurtenances  thereof,  whether requiring structural or
nonstructural repairs, caused by or resulting from any act, omission, neglect or
improper conduct of, or Alterations made by, or the moving of Tenant's fixtures,
furniture or equipment into,  within or out of the Premises by any Tenant Party,
and all damage to any portion of the Building  Systems  located in the Premises,
shall be repaired at Tenant's expense. Such repairs shall be made by (i) Tenant,
at Tenant's expense,  if the required repairs are nonstructural in nature and do

Premises,  or (ii) Landlord,  at Tenant's  expense,  if the required repairs are
structural in nature,  involve  replacement of exterior window glass (if damaged

due  diligence to make any repairs  required to be made by Tenant,  Landlord may
make such  repairs  and all costs and  expenses  incurred by Landlord on account
thereof shall be paid by Tenant as provided in Article 20.

make all changes, alterations,  additions, improvements, repairs or replacements
to the  Building,  including  the Building  Systems  which  provide  services to
Tenant,  as Landlord  deems  necessary or  desirable,  provided that in no event
shall the level of any Building  service  decrease in any material  respect from
the level  required of Landlord  in this Lease as a result  thereof  (other than
temporary  changes in the level of such services  during the  performance of any
such work by  Landlord).  Landlord  shall use  reasonable  efforts  to  minimize
interference  with Tenant's use and occupancy of the Premises  during the making
of such  changes,  repairs,  alterations,  additions,  improvements,  repairs or
replacements   provided  that  Landlord  shall  have  no  obligation  to  employ
contractors  or labor at  overtime  or other  premium  pay rates or to incur any
other overtime costs or additional  expenses  whatsoever.  Except as provided in
Section  11.9,  there shall be no Rent  abatement  or  allowance to Tenant for a

     (b)  "Base  Operating  Expenses"  shall  mean  one-half  of  the  aggregate
Operating Expenses for the Base Expense Years.

     (c) "Base Taxes" shall mean the Assessed Valuation of the Real Property for
the Base Tax Year  multiplied  by the annual real estate tax rate of the City of
New York applicable to the Building for the Base Tax Year, plus all other taxes,
assessments and other governmental levies,  impositions or charges, which may be
assessed  upon  all or any  part of the Real  Property  for the  Base Tax  Year,
provided,  if the Assessed Valuation for the Real Property for the 2000/2001 Tax
Year is more than 105% of the Assessed  Valuation  for the Real Property for the
Base Tax Year other than as a result of a "physical  increase"  contemplated  by
the last  sentence of Section  8.1(h),  then the portion of such  assessment  in
excess of 105%  (other  than as  provided  above)  shall be included in the Real
Property's  Assessed Valuation for the Base Tax Year for purposes of determining
Base Taxes.

     (d)  "Comparison  Year" shall mean (a) with respect to Taxes,  any calendar
year  commencing  subsequent to the first day of the Base Tax Year, and (b) with
respect to Operating  Expenses,  any calendar year commencing  subsequent to the
first day of the 1999 Base Expense Year.

     (e) "Operating Expenses" shall mean the aggregate of all costs and expenses
(and  taxes,  if any,  thereon)  paid or  incurred  by or on behalf of  Landlord
(whether  directly or through  independent  contractors)  in connection with the
ownership,  operation,  repair  and  maintenance  of the  Building  and the Real
Property,  such as: (i) insurance premiums,  (ii) the cost of electricity,  gas,
oil,  steam,  water,  air  conditioning  and  other  fuel and  utilities,  (iii)
attorneys'   fees  and   disbursements   and  auditing,   management  and  other
professional   fees  and  expenses,   and  (iv)  the  annual   depreciation   or
amortization,  on a straight-line basis over the useful life thereof as Landlord
shall reasonably determine (with interest on the unamortized

portion  at the Base  Rate plus 2  percent  per  annum),  of any  capital  costs
incurred  after  the Base  Expense  Years  for any  equipment,  device  or other
improvement  made or acquired  which is either (A)  intended  as a  labor-saving
measure or to effect other economies in the operation,  maintenance or repair of
the Building (but only to the extent that the annual benefits  anticipated to be
realized   therefrom  are  reasonably  related  to  the  annual  amounts  to  be
amortized),  or (B)  required by any  Requirement  other than a  Requirement  in
effect  as of the date of this  Lease  and with  which  Landlord  is not then in
compliance.  Operating  Expenses  shall not include any  Excluded  Expenses.  If
during all or part of the Base Expense Years or any  Comparison  Year,  Landlord
shall not  furnish  any  particular  item(s)  of work or  service  (which  would
otherwise  constitute  an  Operating  Expense) to any  leasable  portions of the
Building for any reason,  then, for purposes of computing Operating Expenses for
the Base Expense  Years or any  Comparison  Year, as the case may be, the amount
included in  Operating  Expenses for such period shall be increased by an amount
equal to the costs and  expenses  that would have been  reasonably  incurred  by
Landlord  during such period if Landlord had  furnished  such item(s) of work or
service to such portion of the Building.  In determining the amount of Operating
Expenses for the Base Expense  Years or any  Comparison  Year,  if less than 100
percent of the Building  rentable  area shall have been occupied by tenant(s) at
any time  during  any such Base  Expense  Years or  Comparison  Year,  Operating
Expenses shall be determined  for such Base Expense Years or Comparison  Year to
be an amount equal to the like expenses  which would  normally be expected to be
incurred had such occupancy been 100 percent  throughout such Base Expense Years
or Comparison Year. To the extent that any service  furnished to the Building is
provided by  facilities  and equipment  located in and employees  located at the
Chrysler  Building,  now known as 405 Lexington Avenue,  New York, New York (the
"Chrysler Building"),  or in any other building owned by Landlord (together with
the Chrysler  Building,  an "Adjoining  Building"),  the cost of maintaining and
repairing such  facilities and equipment and the  compensation of such employees
shall be deemed an Operating Expense of the Building,  if and to the same extent
that such cost would have constituted an Operating  Expense had such facilities,
equipment and employees  been located in or at the Building.  To the extent that
any  service or goods are  furnished  or supplied  to both the  Building  and an
Adjoining  Building pursuant to the same agreement or by the same facilities and
equipment,  Operating  Expenses  for  purposes of this Lease shall be limited to
that  portion  of  the  Operating  Expenses  which  is  properly  allocable,  in
Landlord's reasonable judgment, to the Building.

     (f) "Statement"  shall mean a statement  containing a comparison of (1) the
Taxes  payable for the Base Tax Year and the Taxes  payable  for any  Comparison
Year, or (2) the Base Operating  Expenses and the Operating Expenses payable for
any Comparison Year.

     (g) "Tax Year" shall mean the twelve  month period from July 1 through June
30 (or such other period as  hereinafter  may be duly adopted by the City of New
York as its fiscal year for real estate tax purposes).

     (h) "Taxes"  shall mean (i) all real estate taxes,  assessments,  including
assessments made as a result of the Building being within a business improvement
district,  and  other  governmental  levies,  impositions  or  charges,  whether
general, special, ordinary, extraordinary,  foreseen or unforeseen, which may be
assessed, levied or imposed upon all or any part of the Real Property and/or the
Building  and  (ii)  all  expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and
disbursements and experts' and other witnesses' fees) incurred in contesting any
of the foregoing or in connection  with any  application  for a reduction of the
Assessed  Valuation  of all or any part of the Real  Property  or for a judicial
review thereof (but in no event shall such expenses be included in Taxes payable
for the Base Tax Year).  Taxes  shall not  include  (x)  interest  or  penalties
incurred by Landlord as a result of Landlord's late payment of Taxes, except for
interest  payable in  connection  with the  installment  payment of  assessments
pursuant to the next  sentence or (y) franchise or net income taxes imposed upon
Landlord. If Landlord elects to pay any assessment in annual installments,  then
for the purposes of this Article 8, (A) such assessment  shall be deemed to have
been  so  divided  and to be  payable  in the  maximum  number  of  installments
permitted  by law,  and (B)  there  shall be deemed  included  in Taxes for each
Comparison Year the installments of such assessment becoming payable during such
Comparison  Year,  together with interest payable during such Comparison Year on
such installments and on all installments thereafter becoming due as provided by
law, all as if such  assessment had been so divided.  If at any time the methods
of taxation prevailing on the date hereof shall be altered so that in lieu of or
as an  addition  to the whole or any part of  Taxes,  there  shall be  assessed,
levied or imposed (1) a tax, assessment, levy, imposition or charge based on the
income  or rents  received  from the Real  Property  whether  or not  wholly  or
partially  as a  capital  levy  or  otherwise,  (2)  a  tax,  assessment,  levy,
imposition  or charge  measured  by or based in whole or in part upon all or any
part of the Real Property and imposed upon Landlord,  (3) a license fee measured
by the rents,  or (4) any other tax,  assessment,  levy,  imposition,  charge or
license fee however  described  or  imposed,  then all such taxes,  assessments,
levies, impositions,  charges or license fees or the part thereof so measured or
based  shall be deemed to be Taxes,  provided  that any tax,  assessment,  levy,
imposition  or  charge  imposed  on  income  from  the  Real  Property  shall be
calculated   as  if  the  Real   Property  were  the  only  asset  of  Landlord.
Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  contained  herein,  in the event any
Building Work causes an increase in the Assessed Valuation of the Real Property,
as separately identified on the applicable tax bill as a "physical increase" for
a  Comparison  Year up to the  2001/2002  Tax Year (to the  extent  not  already
included in the Base Tax Year), then the Base Taxes shall be increased solely as
a result of the increased assessment  attributable to such identifiable Building
Work  using the tax rates  otherwise  applicable  to the Base Tax Year (it being
agreed that  Landlord  shall not be required to refund any amount paid by Tenant
for prior Tax Years solely as a result of such adjustment).

     Section 8.2 (a) Tenant's Tax Payment. If the Taxes payable for any Tax Year
after the Base Tax Year  exceed the Base  Taxes,  Tenant  shall pay to  Landlord
Tenant's  Proportionate Share of such excess ("Tenant's Tax Payment").  Landlord
may furnish to Tenant,  prior to the  commencement  of each  Comparison  Year in
which  any  such  Tax Year

                                       17
<PAGE>

commences,  a Statement setting forth Landlord's reasonable estimate of Tenant's
Tax Payment for such Tax Year. Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2(a),
Tenant  shall pay to  Landlord  on the first day of each  month  during any such
Comparison  Year  (and  on the  first  day of  each  month  thereafter  in  such
Comparison  Year) an amount equal to 1/12th of  Landlord's  estimate of Tenant's
Tax Payment for such Tax Year.  If Landlord  shall not furnish any such estimate
for  such  Comparison  Year or if  Landlord  shall  furnish  any  such  estimate
subsequent  to the  commencement  thereof,  then (x)  until the first day of the
month following the month in which such estimate is furnished to Tenant,  Tenant
shall pay to  Landlord  on the first  day of each  month an amount  equal to the
monthly sum payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Section 8.2(a) for the last
month of the preceding  Comparison Year; (y) after such estimate is furnished to
Tenant,  if the  installments  of Tenant's Tax Payment  previously made for such
Comparison  Year were  greater or less than the  installments  of  Tenant's  Tax
Payment  to be made in  accordance  with such  estimate,  then (1) if there is a
deficiency, Tenant shall pay the amount thereof to Landlord within 20 days after
such  estimate  is  furnished  to  Tenant,  or (2) if there  is an  overpayment,
Landlord shall credit such overpayment against subsequent  installments of Rent;
and (z) on the first day of the month following the month in which such estimate
is furnished to Tenant and monthly  thereafter  throughout such Comparison Year,
Tenant  shall pay to Landlord an amount  equal to 1/12th of Tenant's Tax Payment
shown on such estimate.  Landlord may, during each Comparison  Year,  furnish to
Tenant a revised  Statement of  Landlord's  estimate of Tenant's Tax Payment for
such Comparison Year, and in such case, Tenant's Tax Payment for such Comparison
Year shall be adjusted and any deficiencies  paid or overpayments  credited,  as
the case may be,  substantially  in the same manner as provided in the preceding
sentence.  After the end of each  Comparison  Year,  Landlord  shall  furnish to
Tenant a Statement of Taxes for such  Comparison  Year and (A) if such Statement
shall show that the sums so paid by Tenant were less than  Tenant's  Tax Payment
for such  Comparison  Year,  Tenant  shall pay to  Landlord  the  amount of such
deficiency  in  Tenant's  Tax  Payment  within 20 days after such  Statement  is
furnished to Tenant,  or (B) if such Statement  shall show that the sums so paid
by Tenant were more than Tenant's Tax Payment for such Comparison Year, Landlord
shall, at its election,  pay to Tenant such overpayment in Tenant's Tax Payments
or  credit  such   overpayment  in  Tenant's  Tax  Payment  against   subsequent
installments  of  Rent  payable  by  Tenant  and  if  any  such  credit  remains
outstanding as of the Expiration  Date,  Landlord will pay the amount thereof to
Tenant  within 30 days  thereafter.  If there shall be any increase in the Taxes
for any Comparison  Year,  whether during or after such  Comparison  Year, or if
there shall be any decrease in the Taxes for any Comparison  Year,  Tenant's Tax
Payment  for such  Comparison  Year  shall  be  appropriately  adjusted  and any
deficiencies paid or overpayments credited, as the case may be, substantially in
the same  manner as  provided  in the  preceding  sentence.  The  benefit of any
discount for any early  payment or  prepayment of Taxes and of any tax exemption
or  abatement  relating  to all or any part of the Real  Property  shall  accrue
solely  to  the  benefit  of  Landlord  and  Taxes  shall  be  computed  without
subtracting  such  discount  or  taking  into  account  any  such  exemption  or
abatement.

     (b) Taxes for each real estate tax fiscal year shall be  apportioned on the
basis of the number of days in such fiscal year included in any  particular  Tax
Year subsequent to the Base Tax Year for the purpose of making the  computations
under this Section.

     (c) Tenant  shall not (and  hereby  waives any and all rights it may now or
hereafter  have to) institute or maintain any action,  proceeding or application
in any court or other body having the power to fix or review assessed valuations
or tax  rates,  for the  purpose  of  reducing  Taxes.  The  filing  of any such
proceeding by Tenant without  Landlord's  consent shall be an immediate Event of
Default hereunder. If the Base Taxes are reduced, the Additional Rent previously
paid or payable on account of Tenant's Tax Payment  hereunder for all Comparison
Years shall be recomputed on the basis of such  reduction,  and Tenant shall pay
to Landlord, within 20 Business Days after being billed therefor, any deficiency
between  the amount of such  Additional  Rent  previously  computed  and paid by
Tenant to Landlord, and the amount due as a result of such recomputation. If the
Base Taxes are  increased,  then  Landlord  shall  either  pay to Tenant,  or at
Landlord's election,  credit against subsequent payments of Rent due, the amount
by which such Additional Rent previously paid on account of Tenant's Tax Payment
exceeds the amount actually due as a result of such  recomputation.  If Landlord
receives a refund or credit of Taxes for any  Comparison  Year,  Landlord  shall
recalculate Tenant's Tax Payment for the applicable periods (taking into account
the provisions of Section 8.2 (a)) and shall, as and when such refund payment or
credit is received,  at its election,  either pay to Tenant,  or credit  against
subsequent  payments  of  Rent  due  hereunder,  an  amount  equal  to  Tenant's
Proportionate  Share of the refund,  net of any expenses incurred by Landlord in
achieving such refund and  adjustments  to Tenant's Tax Payments  resulting from
such recalculation,  which amount shall not exceed Tenant's Tax Payment paid for
such Comparison Year. Landlord shall not be obligated to file any application or
institute any proceeding seeking a reduction in Taxes or the Assessed Valuation.

     (d) Tenant shall be obligated to make  Tenant's Tax Payment  regardless  of
whether  Tenant may be exempt from the payment of any taxes as the result of any
reduction,  abatement,  or  exemption  from  Taxes  granted  or agreed to by any
Governmental  Authority, or by reason of Tenant's diplomatic or other tax exempt
status.

     (e) If the Expiration Date shall occur on a date other than the last day of
a Tax Year, any Additional Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Section
8.2 for the  Comparison  Year in which  such  Expiration  Date  occurs  shall be
apportioned  on the basis of the number of days in the period from such last day
to the Expiration Date shall bear to the total number of days in such Comparison
Year. In the event of the expiration or earlier  termination of this Lease,  any
Additional  Rent under this Section 8.2 shall be paid or adjusted within 30 days
after submission of the Statement.  In no event shall Fixed Rent ever be reduced
by operation of this Section 8.2.


                                       19

     (f) Tenant shall be responsible  for any  applicable  occupancy or rent tax
now in effect or  hereafter  enacted  and,  if such tax is payable by  Landlord,
Tenant shall promptly pay such amounts to Landlord,  upon Landlord's  demand, as
Additional Rent.

     Section 8.3  Tenant's  Operating  Payment.  (a) If the  Operating  Expenses
payable for any Comparison Year exceed the Base Operating Expenses, Tenant shall
pay to Landlord,  as Additional Rent during each Comparison Year, for any period
from and after  January 1, 2001,  Tenant's  Proportionate  Share of such  excess
("Tenant's Operating Payment"). For each Comparison Year, Landlord shall furnish
to Tenant a written  statement  setting forth  Landlord's good faith  reasonable
estimate of Tenant's Operating Payment for such Comparison Year, based upon such
year's  budget.  Tenant  shall pay to  Landlord  on the first day of each  month
during  such  Comparison  Year an  amount  equal to  one-twelfth  of  Landlord's
estimate of Tenant's  Operating  Payment for such  Comparison  Year. If Landlord
does not  furnish  any such  estimate  for a  Comparison  Year  until  after the
commencement  thereof,  then (i) until the first day of the month  following the
month in which  such  estimate  is  furnished  to  Tenant,  Tenant  shall pay to
Landlord  on the first  day of each  month an amount  equal to the  monthly  sum
payable by Tenant to  Landlord  under this  Section 8.3 during the last month of
the preceding Comparison Year, (ii) promptly after such estimate is furnished to
Tenant or  together  therewith,  Landlord  shall give  notice to Tenant  stating
whether the installments of Tenant's  Operating Payment previously made for such
Comparison Year were greater or less than the installments of Tenant's Operating
Payment to be made for such  Comparison  Year in accordance  with such estimate,
and (A) if there  shall be a  deficiency,  Tenant  shall pay the amount  thereof
within  20 days  after  demand  therefor,  or (B) if there  shall  have  been an
overpayment,  Landlord shall, at its election,  pay to Tenant, or credit against
subsequent  payments of Rent due  hereunder,  the amount thereof and if any such
credit  remains  outstanding as of the  Expiration  Date,  Landlord will pay the
amount thereof to Tenant within 30 days  thereafter,  and (iii) on the first day
of the month  following the month in which such estimate is furnished to Tenant,
and on the first day of each month  thereafter  throughout the remainder of such
Comparison Year,  Tenant shall pay to Landlord an amount equal to one-twelfth of
Tenant's Operating Payment shown on such estimate.

     (b) Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a Statement of Operating  Expenses for
the immediately preceding Comparison Year. If such Statement shall show that the
sums paid by Tenant under Section 8.3(a)  exceeded the actual amount of Tenant's
Operating Payment for such Comparison Year, Landlord shall, at its election, pay
to Tenant,  or credit against  subsequent  payments of Rent due  hereunder,  the
amount of such  excess  and if any such  credit  remains  outstanding  as of the
Expiration  Date,  Landlord will pay the amount thereof to Tenant within 30 days
thereafter.  If the Statement for such  Comparison Year shall show that the sums
so paid by Tenant were less than Tenant's  Operating Payment for such Comparison
Year,  Tenant  shall pay the  amount  of such  deficiency  within 20 days  after
Tenant's receipt of such Statement.

<PAGE>


     (c) If the  Expiration  Date shall occur on a date other than  December 31,
any Additional Rent under this Section 8.3 for the Comparison Year in which such
Expiration  Date shall occur shall be  apportioned on the basis of the number of
days in the period from January 1 to the Expiration Date. Upon the expiration or
earlier  termination  of this Lease,  any  Additional  Rent under this Article 8
shall be paid or adjusted within 30 days after  submission of the Statement.  In
no event shall Fixed Rent ever be reduced by operation of this Section 8.3.

     Section 8.4 Formula. The computations of Additional Rent under this Article
8 are intended to constitute a formula for an agreed rental  adjustment  and may
or may not constitute an actual  reimbursement to Landlord for Taxes,  costs and
expenses paid by Landlord with respect to the Building.

     Section 8.5  Non-Waiver;  Disputes.  (a)  Landlord's  failure to render any
Statement  on a timely  basis  with  respect  to any  Comparison  Year shall not
prejudice Landlord's right to thereafter render a Statement with respect to such
Comparison Year or any subsequent  Comparison Year, nor shall the rendering of a
Statement prejudice  Landlord's right to thereafter render a corrected Statement
for any  Comparison  Year unless such  failure  continues  for more than 3 years
after the expiration of the Comparison  Year in question to which such Statement
or corrected Statement relates.

     (b) Each Statement sent to Tenant shall be conclusively binding upon Tenant
unless Tenant  shall,  within 45 days after such  Statement is sent,  (i) pay to
Landlord the amount set forth in such Statement,  without  prejudice to Tenant's
right to dispute such Statement,  and (ii) request for review backup information
in respect of such  Statement.  Landlord shall provide backup  information  with
respect to Landlord's  Statement as shall  reasonably be necessary for Tenant to
confirm the accuracy  thereof and the proper  inclusion  of Operating  Expenses.
Tenant  agrees that Tenant will not  employ,  in  connection  with any review or
dispute under this Lease,  any person who is to be  compensated,  in whole or in
part, on a contingency fee basis. In connection with any such review or dispute,
Tenant  and  its  representatives  shall  execute  and  deliver  to  Landlord  a
confidentiality  agreement,  in form and substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to
Landlord,  whereby such parties  agree not to disclose to any third party any of
the information obtained in connection with such review, or the substance of any
admissions  or  stipulations  by any party in  connection  therewith,  or of any
resulting  reconciliation,  compromise or  settlement.  Each  Statement  sent to
Tenant shall be conclusively  binding upon Tenant unless Tenant shall, within 60
days after such  additional  backup  information  is provided to Tenant,  send a
written  notice to Landlord  objecting  to such  Statement  and  specifying  the
reasons for Tenant's claim that such Statement is incorrect.  If the parties are
unable to  resolve  any such  dispute  within 30 days  following  the  giving of
Tenant's  notice of  objection,  either  party  may  within  ten days  after the
expiration of such 30-day period refer the issues raised to an independent  firm
of certified public accountants selected by such party and reasonably acceptable
to the other  party,  and,  if the  parties  cannot  agree upon such a firm,  an
independent  firm of  certified  public  accountants  selected  by the

                                       21
<PAGE>

American  Arbitration  Association upon the application of either party, and the
decision of such  accountants  shall be  conclusively  binding upon Landlord and
Tenant.  Tenant  shall pay the fees and  expenses  relating to such  proceeding,
unless such accountants  shall determine that Landlord  overstated the Operating
Expenses by more than 5% for such  Comparison  Year, as finally  determined,  in
which case Landlord shall pay such fees and expenses. Except as provided in this
Section, Tenant shall have no right whatsoever to dispute by judicial process or
otherwise the accuracy of any Statement.

     Section  8.6 No  Reduction  in  Rent.  Anything  in this  Article  8 to the
contrary notwithstanding, under no circumstances shall any decrease in Operating
Expenses or Taxes in any Comparison  Year below the Base  Operating  Expenses or
Base Taxes,  as the case may be,  result in a reduction in the Fixed Rent or any
other component of Additional Rent payable hereunder.

                               REQUIREMENTS OF LAW

     Section 9.1 (a) Tenant's Compliance.  Tenant, at its expense,  shall comply
(or cause to be complied)  with all  Requirements  applicable  to the  Premises,
regardless of whether  imposed by their terms upon Landlord or Tenant,  provided
however,  that Tenant  shall not be  obligated  to comply  with any  Requirement
requiring any structural  alteration to the Premises  unless the  application of
such  Requirement  arises from (i)  Tenant's  manner of use or  occupancy of the
Premises (as distinguished  from the use or occupancy of the Premises for office
purposes generally),  (ii) any cause or condition created by or on behalf of any
Tenant Party  (including any  Alterations),  (iii) the breach of any of Tenant's
obligation under this Lease, or (iv) any Hazardous Materials having been brought
into the Building or affected by any Tenant Party.  All repairs and  alterations
to the  Premises,  required to be made by Tenant as provided  above to cause the
Premises to comply with any  Requirements  shall be made by Tenant,  at Tenant's
expense and in  compliance  with Article 5, if such repairs or  alterations  are
nonstructural,  do not adversely affect any Building  System,  do not affect the
exterior  windows of the  Premises  and do not involve the  performance  of work
outside of the Premises, or by Landlord, at Tenant's reasonable expense, if such
repairs or alterations are structural,  otherwise  affect any Building System or
the exterior  windows of the Premises or involve the performance of work outside
the  Premises.  If Tenant  obtains  knowledge  of any failure to comply with any
Requirements  applicable  to the  Premises,  Tenant shall give  Landlord  prompt
written notice thereof.

     (b) Hazardous Materials. Tenant shall not (i) cause or permit any Hazardous
Materials to be brought into the  Building,  (ii) cause or permit the storage or
use of Hazardous  Materials in any manner not permitted by any Requirements,  or
(iii) cause or permit the escape, disposal or release of any Hazardous Materials
within or in the  vicinity of the

                                       22
<PAGE>

Building.  Nothing  herein  shall  be  deemed  to  prevent  Tenant's  use of any
Hazardous  Materials  customarily  used in the  ordinary  course of office work,
provided  such use is in  accordance  with  all  Requirements.  Tenant  shall be
responsible, at its expense, for all matters directly or indirectly based, on or
arising or resulting from the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous  Materials
in the Premises or in the Building which is caused or permitted by Tenant or any
Tenant Party.  Tenant shall provide to Landlord copies of all  communications in
respect of the  Premises  received  by Tenant with  respect to any  Requirements
relating to Hazardous Materials, and/or any claims made in connection therewith.
Landlord or its agents may perform environmental  inspections of the Premises at
any  time.  The  covenants  contained  in  this  subsection  shall  survive  the
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

     (c)  Landlord's  Compliance.  Landlord  shall  comply  with (or cause to be
complied  with) all  Requirements  applicable to the Building  which are not the
obligation of Tenant, to the extent that non-compliance  would materially impair
Tenant's use and  occupancy of the Premises and Tenant's  ability to conduct its
business in the Premises for office use; and the cost thereof  shall be included
in Operating Expenses.

     (d)  Landlord's  Insurance.  Tenant shall not cause or permit any action or
condition  that would (i)  invalidate  or  conflict  with  Landlord's  insurance
policies, (ii) violate applicable rules,  regulations and guidelines of the Fire
Department,  Fire Insurance  Rating  Organization or any other authority  having
jurisdiction over the Building, (iii) cause an increase in the premiums for fire
insurance  then  covering  the  Building  over  that  payable  with  respect  to
comparable  first-class office buildings,  or (iv) result in insurance companies
of good  standing  refusing to insure the  Building or any  property  therein in
amounts and against  risks as  reasonably  determined  by Landlord.  If the fire
insurance  premiums  increase as a result of Tenant's failure to comply with the
provisions  of this Article,  Tenant shall  promptly cure such failure and shall
reimburse  Landlord,  as  Additional  Rent,  for the  increased  fire  insurance
premiums  paid by Landlord as a result of such failure by Tenant.  In any action
or proceeding to which Landlord and Tenant are parties,  a schedule or "make up"
of rates  for the  Building  or the  Premises  issued  by the  appropriate  Fire
Insurance Rating  Organization,  or other body fixing such fire insurance rates,
shall be conclusive  evidence of the fire insurance rates then applicable to the
Building.

     Section  9.2  Fire  Alarm  System;  Sprinkler.  Tenant  shall  install  and
thereafter  maintain  in good  order  and  repair a  sprinkler,  fire-alarm  and
life-safety  system in the  Premises,  if and to the extent  such system has not
been installed in the Premises prior to the Construction Period Start Date. Such
installation  and  maintenance  shall be performed by Tenant in accordance  with
this  Lease,  the  Rules  and  Regulations  and all  Requirements.  If the  Fire
Insurance Rating Organization or any Governmental Authority or any of Landlord's
insurers requires or recommends any modifications  and/or Alterations be made or
any additional  equipment be supplied in connection with the sprinkler system or
fire alarm and life-safety system serving the Building or the Premises by reason
of Tenant's business,  any Alteration performed by Tenant or the location of the
partitions,  trade fixtures, or other

                                       23
<PAGE>

contents  of the  Premises,  Landlord  (to  the  extent  such  modifications  or
Alterations  are   structural,   affect  any  Building  System  or  involve  the
performance  of work  outside of the  Premises)  or Tenant  (to the extent  such
modifications  or  Alterations  are  nonstructural,  do not affect any  Building
System and do not involve the  performance  of work outside the Premises)  shall
make  such  modifications   and/or  Alterations,   and  supply  such  additional
equipment, in either case at Tenant's expense.

     Section 9.3  Limitations  on Rent. If at any time during the Term by reason
of any  Requirement  the Rent is not fully  collectible,  Tenant shall take such
other steps (without additional expense to Tenant) as Landlord may request,  and
as may be legally  permissible,  to permit Landlord to collect the maximum rents
which may during the continuance of such restriction be legally permissible (but
not in excess of the Rent reserved  under this Lease).  Upon the  termination of
such restriction  during the Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord,  in addition to
the Rent for the  period  following  such  termination  of the  restriction,  if
legally permissible,  the portion of Rent which would have been paid pursuant to
this  Lease  but for such  legal  restriction  less the Rent  paid by  Tenant to
Landlord while such restriction was in effect, together with interest thereon at
the Base Rate.

     Section 9.4 Contest of Requirements.  Tenant, at its expense,  may contest,
by appropriate proceedings prosecuted diligently and in good faith, the legality
or applicability of any Requirement affecting the Premises and with which Tenant
is obligated to comply at its expense pursuant to Section 9.1, provided that (i)
Landlord (or any Indemnitee)  shall not be subject to prosecution for any crime,
nor shall the  Building,  the Real  Property  or any part  thereof be subject to
being  imminently  condemned  or  vacated by reason of  non-compliance,  (ii) no
unsafe or hazardous  condition  relating to such contest or non-compliance  then
exists which remains  uncured,  (iii) such  non-compliance  or contest shall not
prevent  Landlord from  obtaining  any and all permits and licenses  required by
applicable  Requirements in connection  with the operation of the Building,  nor
shall the  certificate  of occupancy for the Building be suspended or threatened
in  writing  by  any  Governmental  Authority  to  be  suspended  by  reason  of
noncompliance or by reason of such contest, (iv) Tenant shall indemnify Landlord
(and any Indemnitee) against the cost of such compliance and liability resulting
from or incurred in  connection  with such contest or  non-compliance,  (v) such
non-compliance  or contest shall not constitute or result in a violation (either
with the  giving of notice or the  passage  of time or both) of the terms of any
Mortgage  or  Superior  Lease,  or if such  Superior  Lease  or  Mortgage  shall
condition such  noncompliance or contest upon the taking of action or furnishing
of security by Landlord,  such action shall be taken or such  security  shall be
furnished  at the  expense of Tenant,  and (vi)  Tenant  shall  promptly  notify
Landlord of such contest and keep Landlord regularly advised as to the status of
such  proceedings.  For the  purposes  of clause  (i)  above,  Landlord  (or any
Indemnitee)  shall be deemed subject to prosecution  for a crime if Landlord (or
any  Indemnitee),  a Lessor,  a Mortgagee or any of their  officers,  directors,
partners, shareholders,  agents or employees is charged with a crime of any kind
whatsoever by reason of such non-compliance unless such charges are withdrawn 10
days before Landlord (or any Indemnitee),  such Lessor or such Mortgagee or such
officer,

                                       24
<PAGE>

director,  partner,  shareholder,  agent or  employee,  as the  case may be,  is
required  to plead or answer  thereto.  Landlord  shall  execute  any  documents
reasonably  required by Tenant in order to permit Tenant effectively to carry on
any such contest permitted under this Section,  provided Landlord is not thereby
subjected to any cost or expense not reimbursed by Tenant.

                                  SUBORDINATION

     Section  10.1  Subordination  and  Attornment.  (a) This Lease and Tenant's
rights  hereunder  are subject and  subordinate  to all  Mortgages  and Superior
Leases,  and, at the request of any Mortgagee or Lessor,  Tenant shall attorn to
such  Mortgagee  or Lessor,  its  successors  in interest or any  purchaser in a
foreclosure sale.

     (b) If a Lessor or Mortgagee or any other person or entity
shall  succeed  to the rights of  Landlord  under this  Lease,  whether  through
possession or foreclosure action or the delivery of a new lease or deed, then at
the request of the successor landlord and upon such successor landlord's written
agreement to accept Tenant's attornment and to recognize Tenant's interest under
this  Lease,  Tenant  shall be deemed to have  attorned to and  recognized  such
successor  landlord as Landlord under this Lease. The provisions of this Article
are  self-operative  and require no further  instruments  to give effect hereto;
provided, however, that Tenant shall promptly execute and deliver any instrument
that  such  successor  landlord  may  reasonably  request  (x)  evidencing  such
attornment,  (y) setting forth the terms and conditions of Tenant's tenancy, and
(z)  containing  such other  terms and  conditions  as may be  required  by such
Mortgagee or Lessor, provided such terms and conditions do not increase Tenant's
obligations  other than to a de minimis extent or adversely affect the rights of
Tenant under this Lease other than to a de minimis extent.  Upon such attornment
this Lease  shall  continue in full force and effect as a direct  lease  between
such  successor  landlord  and  Tenant  upon all of the  terms,  conditions  and
covenants set forth in this Lease except that such successor  landlord shall not
be:

          (i) liable for any act or omission  of Landlord  (except to the extent
such act or omission is a default under this Lease and continues beyond the date
when such successor landlord succeeds to Landlord's  interest and Tenant gives
notice of such act or omission to such successor landlord);

          (ii)  subject to any  defense,  claim, counterclaim, set-off or offset
which Tenant may have against Landlord (except as provided in clause (i) above,
Section 4.2(c) and in Articles 13 and 14);

          (iii) bound by any  prepayment  of more than one month's  Rent to any
prior landlord;


                                       25
<PAGE>


          (iv) bound by any  obligation  to make any payment to Tenant which was
required to be made prior to the time such successor landlord succeeded to
Landlord's interest other than pursuant to Section 4.2;

          (v)bound by any obligation to perform any work or to make improvements
to the Premises except for (x) repairs and  maintenance  required to be made by
landlord under this Lease, and (y) repairs to the Premises as a result of damage
by fire or other casualty or a partial  condemnation  pursuant to the provisions
of this Lease, but only to the extent that such  repairs can  reasonably be made
from the net  proceeds of any insurance or condemnation awards, respectively,
actually made available to such successor landlord; or

          (vi)  bound by any  modification,  amendment  or renewal of this Lease
made without the consent of any Lessor or Mortgagee of which Tenant has been
provided notice (other than pursuant to the express provisions of Articles 37
and 38).

     Section 10.2 Mortgage or Superior Lease  Defaults.  Any Mortgagee may elect
that this Lease shall have  priority  over the Mortgage  that it holds and, upon
notification  to Tenant by such  Mortgagee,  this Lease  shall be deemed to have
priority over such Mortgage, regardless of the date of this Lease. In connection
with any financing of the Real Property,  the Building or of the interest of the
lessee  under  any  Superior  Lease,  Tenant  shall  consent  to any  reasonable
modifications of this Lease requested by any lending institution,  provided such
modifications do not increase the  obligations,  or adversely affect the rights,
of Tenant under this Lease other than to a de minimis extent in any case.

     Section 10.3 Tenant's Termination Right. Except as provided in Section13.3,
as long as any Superior Lease or Mortgage shall exist,  Tenant shall not seek to
terminate  this Lease by reason of any act or  omission  of  Landlord  (a) until
Tenant  shall have given  notice of such act or omission  to all Lessors  and/or
Mortgagees,  and (b)  until a  reasonable  period  of time  shall  have  elapsed
following  the  giving of  notice  of such  default  and the  expiration  of any
applicable  notice or grace periods  (unless such act or omission is not capable
of being remedied  within a reasonable  period of time) during which period such
Lessors and/or  Mortgagees shall have the right,  but not the obligation,  after
obtaining  possession  of the  Building  to  remedy  such  act or  omission  and
thereafter diligently proceed to so remedy such act or obligation. If any Lessor
or Mortgagee elects to remedy such act or omission of Landlord, Tenant shall not
seek to terminate  this Lease so long as such Lessor or Mortgagee is  proceeding
with reasonable diligence to effect such remedy.

     Section 10.4 Applicability.  The provisions of this Article shall (a) inure
to the  benefit  of  Landlord,  any  future  owner of the  Building  or the Real
Property,  any  Lessor or  Mortgagee  and any  sublessor  thereof  and (b) apply
notwithstanding  that,  as a matter of law,  this Lease may  terminate  upon the
termination of any Superior Lease or the foreclosure of any Mortgage.

     Section 10.5 Future Condominium Declaration. This Lease and Tenant's rights
hereunder  are  and  will  be  subject  and   subordinate  to  any   condominium
declaration,  by-laws and other instruments  (collectively,  the  "Declaration")
which may be recorded in order to subject the Building to a condominium  form of
ownership  pursuant  to  Article  9-B of the New York Real  Property  Law or any
successor statute,  provided that the Declaration does not by its terms increase
the Rent or increase Tenant's non-Rent  obligations under this Lease (other than
to a de minimis  extent) or adversely  affect  Tenant's  rights under this Lease
(other than to a de minimis extent). At Landlord's  request,  and subject to the
foregoing proviso, and provided Tenant shall receive a non-disturbance agreement
reasonably  satisfactory  to it,  Tenant will execute and deliver to Landlord an
amendment of this Lease confirming such  subordination  and modifying this Lease
to conform to such condominium regime.

     Section 10.6 Non-Disturbance Agreements. Landlord represents that there
is no Superior Lease and the only existing Mortgagee is Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. ("Lehman").  Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to obtain for Tenant, at
no cost to  Landlord,  the SNDA  referred to below.  If  Landlord  shall fail to
deliver to Tenant a  subordination  and  non-disturbance  agreement (the "SNDA")
from Lehman substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit H within 60 days
following  execution  and delivery of this Lease by both  parties,  Tenant shall
have the right for 10 days after the  expiration of such 60-day period to cancel
this Lease by giving  Landlord  notice of such  election,  whereupon  this Lease
shall become null and void as of the date such notice is given, provided that if
Landlord  shall deliver the SNDA to Tenant within 10 days  following  receipt of
notice of cancellation  from Tenant,  this Lease shall continue and Tenant shall
have no right to cancel  it. If no notice is given  within  such  10-day  period
(time being of the essence),  then Tenant's  right to cancel this Lease shall be
deemed  waived.  As a condition to Tenant's  agreement  hereunder to subordinate
Tenant's  interest in this Lease to any future Mortgage or future Superior Lease
made between Landlord and any Mortgagee or Lessor,  as the case may be, Landlord
shall obtain from each such future  Mortgagee and Lessor,  as the case may be, a
subordination  and  non-disturbance  agreement in the standard form  customarily
employed  by such  Mortgagee  or  Lessor,  as the  case  may be.  Any  agreement
substantially  in the  form of a  subordination  and  non-disturbance  agreement
previously  executed  by Tenant in  connection  with this Lease  shall be deemed
satisfactory  to Tenant.  If Tenant  shall fail or refuse,  for any  reason,  to
execute and deliver to Landlord a subordination and non-disturbance agreement in
proper  form  within 10 days after  delivery  thereof to Tenant,  then  Tenant's
interest under this Lease shall be subordinate to the future  Mortgage or future
Superior Lease in question.

Days from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

     Section 11.2 Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning.  (a) Landlord shall
furnish to the Premises heating,  ventilation and  air-conditioning  ("HVAC") in
accordance  with the  standards set forth in Exhibit E on all Business Days from
8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Landlord,  at its expense,  shall repair and maintain the
HVAC System in good working order,  provided repairs required as a result of the
negligence  or willful  misconduct of Tenant,  its agents or  employees,  shall,
subject to the  provisions of Section  12.2,  be performed at Tenant's  expense.
Landlord  shall have access to all  air-cooling,  fan,  ventilating  and machine
rooms and electrical closets and all other mechanical  installations of Landlord
(collectively,  "Mechanical  Installations"),  and  Tenant  shall not  construct
partitions or other  obstructions  which may interfere  with  Landlord's  access
thereto  or the  moving  of  Landlord's  equipment  to and from  the  Mechanical
Installations. Neither Tenant, nor its agents, employees or contractors shall at
any time enter the Mechanical Installations or tamper with, adjust, or otherwise
affect such Mechanical Installations.

     (b)  Landlord  shall not be  responsible  if the  normal  operation  of the
Building System providing HVAC to the Premises (the "HVAC System") shall fail to
provide  cooled  or  heated  air,  as the case may be,  in  accordance  with the
specifications  set  forth  in  Exhibit  E by  reason  of (i) any  machinery  or
equipment  installed by or on behalf of Tenant or any person claiming through or
under  Tenant,  which  shall have an  electrical  load in excess of the  average
electrical load and human occupancy factors for the HVAC System as designed,  as
the case may be, or (ii) any  rearrangement of partitioning or other Alterations
(including  the  Initial  Installations)  made or  performed  by or on behalf of
Tenant or any person claiming through or under Tenant.  Tenant shall install, if
missing,  blinds or shades on all  windows,  which  blinds and  shades  shall be
subject to Landlord's  approval,  and shall keep all of the operable  windows in
the Premises  closed,  and lower the blinds when necessary  because of the sun's
position,  whenever the HVAC System is in  operation  or when and as  reasonably
required  by any  Requirement.  Tenant at all times shall  cooperate  fully with
Landlord  and shall  abide by the  rules  and  regulations  which  Landlord  may
reasonably  prescribe  for the proper  functioning  and  protection  of the HVAC
System.

     Section 11.3 Overtime Freight Elevators and HVAC. The Rent does not reflect
or include  any  charge to Tenant for the  furnishing  of any  freight  elevator
service or HVAC to the Premises  during any periods other than for the hours and
days set forth in Sections 11.1 and 11.2 hereof ("Overtime  Periods").  Landlord
shall not be required  to furnish  any such


                                       28
<PAGE>

services  during  Overtime  Periods unless Tenant  delivers notice to Landlord's
property  management  office  serving the Building  requesting  such services at
least 24 hours prior to the time at which such services are to be provided,  but
Landlord  shall  use  reasonable  efforts  (without   obligation  to  incur  any
additional  cost) to arrange such service on such shorter notice as Tenant shall
provide.  If Landlord  furnishes freight elevator service to the Premises during
Overtime Periods, Tenant shall pay to Landlord Landlord's then established rates
for such service in the Building. If Landlord shall furnish HVAC to the Premises
during  Overtime  Periods,   Tenant  shall  pay  to  Landlord   Landlord's  then
established  rates per floor for such service in the Building,  which rate is on
the date of this Lease $150 per hour.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
provided in this Article 11, on a single weekend  during which Tenant  initially
moves into the  Premises  for the  conduct of its  business,  upon 5 days' prior
notice from Tenant to Landlord,  Landlord shall make available to Tenant freight
elevator   service  in  accordance   with  Landlord's  then  current  rules  and
regulations applicable thereto from 8:00 p.m. on the "move-in" Friday until 7:00
p.m. on the following Sunday at no cost to Tenant.

portions  thereof used for the storage,  preparation,  service or consumption of
food or  beverages,  as an  exhibition  area or  classroom,  for  storage,  as a
shipping room, mail room or similar purposes, for private bathrooms,  showers or
exercise facilities, as a trading floor, or primarily for operation of computer,
data processing, reproduction,  duplicating or similar equipment) to be cleaned,
substantially in accordance with the standards set forth in Exhibit F. Any areas
of the Premises requiring cleaning which Landlord is not required to clean under
this Section 11.4,  and any  additional  cleaning of any portion of the Premises
requested by Tenant shall be done at Tenant's expense,  by Landlord's  employees
or  Landlord's  contractor,  at rates which shall be  competitive  with rates of
other cleaning contractors providing services to first-class office buildings in
midtown  Manhattan.  Landlord and its cleaning  contractor and their  respective
employees  shall have access to the  Premises at all times  except  between 8:00

     Section 11.5 Water.  Landlord, at Landlord's expense,  shall provide to the
Premises cold water for drinking, cleaning, dishwasher and lavatory purposes. If
Tenant requires or uses water or steam for any additional purposes, Landlord may
install a meter to measure the water or steam  furnished.  Tenant  shall pay the
cost of such  installation,  and for all  maintenance,  repairs and replacements
thereto,  and for the  reasonable  charges  of  Landlord  for the water or steam
furnished.  Tenant shall also pay Landlord's  reasonable charge for any required
pumping  or  heating  thereof,  and any sewer  rent,  tax  and/or  charge now or
hereafter assessed or imposed upon the Premises or the Real Property pursuant to
any Requirement. If any tax is imposed upon Landlord's receipts from the sale or
resale of water or steam to Tenant,  Tenant  shall  reimburse  Landlord for such
tax, if and to the extent permitted by law.

     Section 11.6 Refuse and Rubbish Removal.  Landlord shall provide refuse and
rubbish removal  services at the Premises for ordinary office refuse and rubbish
pursuant to

                                       29
<PAGE>

regulations  reasonably  established by Landlord.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord,
within 20 days after  delivery  of an invoice  therefor,  Landlord's  reasonable
charge  for such  removal  to the extent  that the  refuse  generated  by Tenant
exceeds the refuse and rubbish  customarily  generated by executive  and general
office tenants. Tenant shall not dispose of any refuse and rubbish in the public
areas of the  Building,  and if any Tenant Party does so, Tenant shall be liable
for Landlord's reasonable charge for such removal. Tenant shall cause all Tenant
Parties to observe  such  additional  rules and  regulations  regarding  rubbish
removal and/or recycling as Landlord may, from time to time, reasonably impose.

     Section 11.7 Condenser  Water.  Landlord shall provide  condenser  water in
connection with Tenant's independent supplemental  air-conditioning units, which
shall  not  exceed 10 tons in the  aggregate  and which  shall be  installed  in
accordance with the provisions of Article 5 hereof. Tenant shall pay Landlord an
annual charge for such condenser water at Landlord's then  established  rate for
condenser  water,  which charge is, on the date of this Lease,  $250 per ton and
which  charge  shall be  payable in equal  monthly  installments  together  with
Tenant's  payment  of Fixed  Rent and shall be  payable  whether  or not  Tenant
utilizes such amount of condenser water. If Tenant fails to utilize any quantity
of  condenser  water for two years or more,  Landlord  shall have the right upon
notice to Tenant to irrevocably  reduce the number of tons of condenser water to
which Tenant is entitled hereunder by the number of such unutilized tons (unless
Tenant notifies  Landlord within ten days after Tenant's  receipt of such notice
from Landlord that it anticipates  utilizing a portion or all of such unutilized
tons of condenser  water,  in which case  Landlord  shall only have the right to
reduce the number of tons of condenser water to which Tenant is then entitled by
such number as Tenant does not anticipate  utilizing),  provided,  however, that
Landlord shall have the right upon further notice to Tenant to reduce the number
of tons of  condenser  water to which  Tenant is then  entitled by any number of
tons of  condenser  water that Tenant has  reserved in its notice to Landlord if
Tenant fails to utilize any such  reserved  tons prior to the  expiration of the
cooling season (i.e., May 1 to September 30) next following  Tenant's receipt of
the first notice from Landlord), in which case Landlord shall only charge Tenant
for such lower number of tons of condenser  water.  In addition to the foregoing
charges  there shall be a one-time  "tap-in" fee equal to $1,500 per ton of unit
capacity,  payable within 20 days after  rendition of a bill therefor.  Landlord
shall  not be  liable  to Tenant  for any  failure  or  defect in the  supply or
character of condenser  water  supplied to Tenant by reason of any  Requirement,
act or omission of the public  service  company  serving the Building or for any
other  reason  not  attributable  to the  negligence  or willful  misconduct  of
Landlord, its agents, contractors and employees.

     Section 11.8 Service Interruptions.  Landlord reserves the right to suspend
any service  when  necessary,  by reason of  Unavoidable  Delays,  accidents  or
emergencies,  or for repairs,  alterations or improvements  which, in Landlord's
reasonable judgment,  are necessary or appropriate until such Unavoidable Delay,
accident or emergency  shall cease or such repairs,  alterations or improvements
are completed,  and Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any interruption,
curtailment or failure to supply services. Landlord shall use

                                       30
<PAGE>


reasonable  efforts to restore such service,  remedy such situation and minimize
any interference  with Tenant's  business,  provided that Landlord shall have no
obligation  to employ  contractors  or labor at  overtime  or other  premium pay
rates, or to incur any other overtime costs or additional  expenses  whatsoever.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 11.9, the exercise of any such
right or the occurrence of any such failure by Landlord shall not (a) constitute
an actual or constructive  eviction,  in whole or in part, (b) entitle Tenant to
any  compensation,  abatement or diminution of Rent, (c) relieve Tenant from any
of its  obligations  under this Lease, or (d) impose any liability upon Landlord
by reason of inconvenience to Tenant, or interruption of Tenant's  business,  or
otherwise.

     Section  11.9 Rent  Abatement.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary
contained  in this  Lease,  if  Tenant is  unable  to use the  Premises  for the
ordinary  conduct of Tenant's  business due solely to (a) an  interruption of an
Essential Service (as hereinafter defined) resulting from Landlord's performance
of an  improvement  to the Building or (b)  Landlord's  breach of an  obligation
under this Lease to perform repairs or replacements  which results in Landlord's
failure to provide an Essential Service,  in each case other than as a result of
Unavoidable Delays, casualty or condemnation, and such condition continues for a
period in excess of 10  consecutive  Business Days after (i) Tenant  furnishes a
notice to Landlord (the "Abatement  Notice") stating that Tenant's  inability to
use the Premises is solely due to such condition,  (ii) Tenant does not actually
use or occupy the Premises  during such period for the  ordinary  conduct of its
business  and (iii) such  condition  has not  resulted  from the  negligence  or
misconduct  of any Tenant  Party,  then Fixed  Rent,  Tenant's  Tax  Payment and
Tenant's  Operating  Payment  shall be abated on a per diem basis for the period
commencing on the 11th Business Day after Tenant  delivers the Abatement  Notice
to  Landlord  and ending on the earlier of (x) the date  Tenant  reoccupies  any
portion  of  the  Premises,  and  (y)  the  date  on  which  such  condition  is
substantially remedied.  "Essential Service" shall mean a service which Landlord
is obligated  under this Lease to provide to Tenant which if not provided  shall
(1) effectively  deny access to the Premises,  (2) threaten the health or safety
of any  occupants  of the  Premises or (3) prevent the usage of more than 25% of
the Premises for the ordinary conduct of Tenant's business.

     Section 11.10 Access to Premises.  Subject to Unavoidable  Delay,  security
requirements, service interruptions, Rules and Regulations, and any other events
beyond Landlord's  control,  Tenant shall have access to the Premises 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week.

                INSURANCE; PROPERTY LOSS OR DAMAGE; REIMBURSEMENT

         Section 12.1  Tenant's  Insurance.  (a) Tenant,  at its expense,  shall
obtain  and keep in full  force and  effect  during the Term and prior to having
access to the Premises:

                                       31
<PAGE>


          (i)  a  policy  of  commercial  general  liability   insurance  on  an
     occurrence basis against claims for personal injury,  death and/or property
     damage  occurring  in or about the  Premises or the  Building,  under which
     Tenant is named as the insured and Landlord, Landlord's managing agent, any
     Lessors,  any  Mortgagees and any other parties whose names shall have been
     furnished  by Landlord to Tenant from time to time are named as  additional
     insureds,   which  insurance  shall  provide   primary   coverage   without
     contribution  from any other  insurance  carried  by or for the  benefit of
     Landlord,  Landlord's  managing agent or any Lessors or Mortgagees named as
     additional  insureds,  and  Tenant  agrees  to  obtain  blanket  broad-form
     contractual  liability  coverage to insure its  indemnity  obligations  set
     forth in Article 32 hereof.  The  minimum  limits of  liability  shall be a
     combined  single limit with respect to each occurrence and in the aggregate
     in an amount of not less than $10,000,000; provided, however, that Landlord
     shall  during  the  Renewal  Term  retain  the right to  require  Tenant to
     increase  such  coverage,  from time to time,  to that amount of  insurance
     which in Landlord's  reasonable judgment is then being customarily required
     by landlords for similar office space in first-class  buildings in the City
     of New York.  Tenant  may  provide  such  insurance  coverage  as part of a
     blanket or  umbrella  policy,  which  includes  other  premises  of Tenant,
     provided  the  aggregate  limits of  insurance  coverage  required to be in
     effect for the  Premises  pursuant to the terms hereof shall not be reduced
     as a result of claims  made  against  other  premises or property of Tenant
     covered  under such  policies,  and such blanket or umbrella  polices shall
     comply with the terms hereof.  The deductible or self insured retention for
     such policy shall in no event exceed $10,000 per occurrence at any time. If
     the aggregate limit applying to the Premises is reduced by the payment of a
     claim or  establishment  of a reserve  equal to or greater  than 50% of the
     annual aggregate,  Tenant shall  immediately  arrange to have the aggregate
     limit restored by endorsement to the existing  policy or the purchase of an
     additional  insurance  policy unless,  in Landlord's  reasonable  judgment,
     Tenant maintains  sufficient  excess liability  insurance (with a drop down
     endorsement)  to satisfy the liability  requirements  of this Lease without
     the reinstatement of the aggregate limit;

          (ii)  insurance  against loss or damage by fire,  and such other risks
     and hazards as are insurable  under then  available  standard forms of "all
     risk" property insurance policies with extended coverage, insuring Tenant's
     Property,  and all  Specialty  Alterations  for the  full  insurable  value
     thereof or replacement cost value thereof,  having a reasonable  deductible
     amount, if any, as reasonably determined by Landlord;

          (iii)  during the  performance  of any  Alteration,  until  completion
     thereof, Builder's risk insurance on an "all risk" basis and on a completed
     value form including a Permission to Complete and Occupy  endorsement,  for
     full  replacement  value  covering the interest of Landlord and Tenant (and
     their  respective  contractors and  subcontractors),  any Mortgagee and any
     Lessor in all work  incorporated  in the  Building  and all  materials  and
     equipment in or about the Premises;

          (iv) Workers' Compensation Insurance, as required by law;


                                       32
<PAGE>


          (v) Business Interruption Insurance; and

          (vi) such other  insurance in such amounts as Landlord,  any Mortgagee
     and/or any Lessor may  reasonably  require from time to time,  and which is
     then  customarily  required  from office  tenants by owners of  first-class
     office buildings in Manhattan.

     (b) All insurance required to be carried by Tenant pursuant to the terms of
this Lease (i) shall  contain a provision  that (A) no act or omission of Tenant
other  than  intentional  acts  shall  affect  or limit  the  obligation  of the
insurance company to pay the amount of any loss sustained,  (B) the policy shall
not be  cancelled  nor shall any  material  change in coverage  be made  thereto
unless  Landlord,  Lessors and  Mortgagees of which Tenant has notice shall have
received 30 days' prior  notice of such  cancellation  or  material  change,  by
certified  mail,  return  receipt  requested,  and (C)  Tenant  shall be  solely
responsible  for the payment of all premiums  under such  policies and Landlord,
Lessors and  Mortgagees  shall have no obligation for the payment  thereof,  and
(ii) shall be effected under valid and enforceable  policies issued by reputable
and independent  insurers  permitted to do business in the State of New York and
rated in Best's Insurance Guide, or any successor  thereto (or if there be none,
an organization having a national  reputation) as having a Best's Rating of "A-"
and a "Financial Size Category" of at least "X" or, if such ratings are not then
in effect, the equivalent thereof or such other financial rating as Landlord may
at any time consider appropriate.

     (c) On or prior to the Construction Period Start Date, Tenant shall deliver
to Landlord  appropriate  policies of insurance or  certificates of insurance as
provided  below,  including  evidence of waivers of  subrogation  required to be
carried by each party  pursuant to this Article 12.  Evidence of each renewal or
replacement  of a policy  shall be  delivered  by Tenant to Landlord at least 10
days  prior  to the  expiration  of such  policy.  In lieu  of the  policies  of
insurance  required to be  delivered  to Landlord  pursuant to this Article (the
"Policies"),  Tenant may  deliver  to  Landlord a  certification  from  Tenant's
insurance  company  (on an  "Accord"  form  or  the  equivalent)  and a  related
endorsement  which shall be binding on  Tenant's  insurance  company,  and which
shall expressly provide that such  certification (i) conveys to Landlord and any
other  named  insured  and/or  additional   insureds  thereunder  (the  "Insured
Parties") all the rights and privileges  afforded under the applicable  Policies
as primary  insurance,  and (ii)  contains an  unconditional  obligation  of the
insurance  company to advise all Insured  Parties in writing by certified  mail,
return  receipt  requested,  at least 30 days in advance of any  termination  or
change to the  applicable  Policies that would affect the interest of any of the
Insured Parties.

     Section 12.2 Waiver of Subrogation.  Landlord and Tenant shall each procure
an appropriate  clause in or endorsement to any property  insurance covering the
Premises,  the Building and personal  property,  fixtures and equipment  located
therein, wherein the insurance companies shall waive subrogation or consent to a
waiver of right of recovery, and, notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to
the  contrary,  Landlord  and  Tenant  agree to


                                       33
<PAGE>

release,  not to make any claim against,  or seek to recover from, the other for
any loss or damage to its property or the property of others resulting from fire
and other hazards to the extent covered by such property insurance regardless of
the amount of any  self-insurance  or deductible;  provided,  however,  that the
release,  discharge,  exoneration and covenant not to sue contained herein shall
be limited by and  coextensive  with the terms and  provisions  of the waiver of
subrogation or waiver of right of recovery.

     Section 12.3 Landlord's Insurance. Landlord shall keep the Building insured
against  damage and  destruction  by fire,  vandalism,  and other  perils in the
amount  of the  full  replacement  value  of the  Building  (as  determined  for
insurance  purposes)  as the  value may exist  from time to time,  exclusive  of
foundations  and  footings,  or such lesser  amount as will avoid  co-insurance.
Landlord  shall  maintain   contractual  and  comprehensive   general  liability
insurance,  including bodily injury and property damage, with a minimum combined
single limit of liability of $1,000,000 for bodily injury or death of any person
occurring in or about the Building and $3,000,000 for injury,  death, or damages
resulting  to more than one person in any one  occurrence.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  in the event Landlord is an institutional  owner,  then Landlord may
elect to  self-insure  with respect to the insurance  coverages  required by the
terms of this Section 12.3.  Tenant  acknowledges  that Landlord shall not carry
insurance  on, and shall not be  responsible  for,  (a) damage to any  Specialty
Alterations,  (b) Tenant's Property,  and (c) any loss suffered by Tenant due to
interruption of Tenant's business.

                        DESTRUCTION - FIRE OR OTHER CAUSE

     Section  13.1  Restoration.  If the  Premises  are damaged by fire or other
casualty,  or if the  Building  is  damaged  such  that  Tenant is  deprived  of
reasonable access to the Premises,  Tenant shall give prompt notice to Landlord,
and the damage shall be repaired by Landlord,  at its expense,  to substantially
the condition of the Premises prior to the damage,  subject to the provisions of
any Mortgage or Superior Lease,  but Landlord shall have no obligation to repair
or restore (a) Tenant's  Property or (b) any Specialty  Alterations.  Until such
time as (x) the restoration of the Premises is Substantially  Completed or would
have been  Substantially  Completed but for Tenant Delay, (y) Landlord  notifies
Tenant of same and (z) Landlord  provides  Tenant access to the Premises,  Fixed
Rent,  Tenant's Tax Payment and Tenant's  Operating  Payment shall be reduced in
the  proportion  by which the area of the part of the  Premises  (excluding  any
portion  thereof  used   principally  for  storage)  which  is  not  usable  (or
accessible)  and is not used by Tenant  bears to the total area of the  Premises
(excluding any such portion).

     Section 13.2 Landlord's Termination Right.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary  contained  in Section  13.1,  if the  Building  is so damaged  that in
Landlord's opinion,

                                       34
<PAGE>

substantial  alteration,  demolition,  or  reconstruction  of  the  Building  is
required (whether or not the Premises are so damaged or rendered  untenantable),
then in such event,  Landlord may, not later than 60 days  following the date of
the damage, give Tenant a notice terminating this Lease,  provided that Landlord
may not terminate this Lease unless Landlord similarly  terminates the leases of
other office tenants in the Building  aggregating at least either (a) 33% of the
portion of the Building  occupied for office purposes  immediately prior to such
damage or (b) 50% of the rentable  area of the Building  located in the elevator
bank servicing the Premises. If this Lease is so terminated,  (i) the Term shall
expire  upon the date set forth in  Landlord's  notice,  which shall not be less
than 30 days after such notice is given,  and Tenant  shall  vacate the Premises
and  surrender  the same to  Landlord  no later  than the date set  forth in the
notice,  (ii)  Tenant's  liability  for Rent  shall  cease as of the date of the
damage,  and (iii) any prepaid  Rent for any period after the date of the damage
shall be refunded by Landlord to Tenant and the Security  Deposit,  if any, then
held by Landlord shall be refunded to Tenant,  provided there is then no default
under this Lease.

     Section 13.3 Tenant's  Termination  Right.  (a) If the Premises are totally
damaged and are thereby rendered wholly  untenantable,  or if the Building shall
be so damaged that Tenant is deprived of reasonable access to the Premises,  and
if  Landlord  elects to restore the  Premises,  Landlord  shall,  within 60 days
following the date of the damage,  cause a contractor  or architect  selected by
Landlord  to give  notice  (the  "Restoration  Notice") to Tenant of the date by
which such  contractor or architect  estimates the  restoration  of the Premises
shall be  Substantially  Completed.  If such date, as set forth the  Restoration
Notice,  is more than 15 months from the date of such damage,  then Tenant shall
have the right to  terminate  this  Lease by  giving  notice  (the  "Termination
Notice") to Landlord not later than 30 days  following  Tenant's  receipt of the
Restoration  Notice. If Tenant delivers to Landlord a Termination  Notice,  this
Lease  shall be deemed to have  terminated  as of the date of the  giving of the
Termination  Notice,  in the manner set forth in the second  sentence of Section
13.2.

     (b) If Tenant shall not have elected to, or was not entitled to,  terminate
this  Lease in  accordance  with  Section  13.3(a)  and  Landlord  shall fail to
Substantially  Complete its restoration  work on or before the later to occur of
15 months  after the date of such  damage or 60 days  after the date upon  which
Landlord's   contractor   estimated  such  restoration  would  be  Substantially
Completed,  in either case,  subject to extension  (not to exceed 90 days in the
aggregate) for delays due to Unavoidable  Delays,  Tenant may elect, as its sole
remedy,  to  terminate  this Lease  upon 30 days  notice to  Landlord  given not
earlier  than the last day of the period  specified  above,  and if Tenant shall
give such a notice  this Lease shall  terminate  on the 30th day  following  the
giving of such notice unless  Landlord  shall have  Substantially  Completed its
reconstruction  work by such 30th day.  If  Landlord  shall  have  Substantially
Completed its  restoration  work within such 30-day period,  Tenant's  notice of
termination shall be null and void and this Lease shall remain in full force and
effect.

     Section  13.4 Final 12 Months.  Notwithstanding  anything  set forth to the
contrary in this Article 13, in the event that any damage rendering the Premises
wholly  untenantable  occurs during the final 12 months of the Term (taking into
account any exercise by Tenant of any renewal  option then available to Tenant),
either  Landlord or Tenant may terminate this Lease by notice to the other party
within 30 days after the  occurrence  of such damage and this Lease shall expire
on the 30th day after the date of such  notice.  For  purposes  of this  Section
13.4,  the Premises shall be deemed wholly  untenantable  if due to such damage,
Tenant  shall be  precluded  from  using more than 50% of the  Premises  for the
conduct  of its  business  and  Tenant's  inability  to so use the  Premises  is
reasonably expected to continue until at least the earlier of the (a) Expiration
Date and (b) the 90th day after the date when such damage occurs.

     Section  13.5  Waiver  of  Real  Property  Law ss.  227.  This  Article  13
constitutes an express agreement  governing any case of damage or destruction of
the Premises or the Building by fire or other  casualty,  and Section 227 of the
Real Property Law of the State of New York,  which provides for such contingency
in the  absence of an express  agreement,  and any other law of like  nature and
purpose now or hereafter in force, shall have no application in any such case.

     Section  13.6  Landlord's  Liability.  Any  Building  employee  to whom any
property  shall be  entrusted  by or on behalf  of Tenant  shall be deemed to be
acting as Tenant's agent with respect to such property and neither  Landlord nor
any of the Indemnitees  shall be liable for any damage to such property,  or for
the loss of or damage to any property of Tenant by theft or  otherwise.  None of
the Indemnitees  shall be liable for any injury or damage to persons or property
or interruption of Tenant's business resulting from fire or other casualty,  any
damage caused by other tenants or persons in the Building or by  construction of
any private,  public or quasi-public  work, or any latent defect in the Premises
or in the Building (except that Landlord shall be required to repair the same to
the extent  provided in Article 7). No penalty shall accrue for delays which may
arise by reason of  adjustment  of fire  insurance  on the part of  Landlord  or
Tenant,  or Unavoidable  Delays, in connection with any repair or restoration of
any portion of the Premises or of the Building.  Landlord  shall use  reasonable
efforts to minimize interference with Tenant's use and occupancy of the Premises
during the  performance of any such repair or  restoration,  provided,  however,
that  Landlord  shall  have no  obligation  to  employ  contractors  or labor at
overtime  or other  premium  pay rates or to incur any other  overtime  costs or
additional  expenses  whatsoever.  Nothing in this Section 13.6 shall affect any
right of Landlord to be indemnified by Tenant under Article 32 for payments made
to compensate for losses of third parties.

     Section  13.7  Windows.  If at any time any  windows  of the  Premises  are
temporarily closed, darkened or covered over by reason of repairs,  maintenance,
alterations  or  improvements  to  the  Building,  or any of  such  windows  are
permanently  closed,  darkened or covered over due to any Requirement,  Landlord
shall not be liable for any damage  Tenant may sustain  and Tenant  shall not be
entitled  to any  compensation  or  abatement  of any  Rent,

                                       36
<PAGE>

nor shall the same release Tenant from its  obligations  hereunder or constitute
an actual or constructive eviction.

                                 EMINENT DOMAIN

     Section 14.1 (a) Total Taking. If all or substantially all of the Premises,
the Building or the Real Property  shall be acquired or condemned for any public
or quasi-public purpose, this Lease shall terminate and the Term shall end as of
the date of the vesting of title,  with the same effect as if such date were the
Expiration Date, and Rent shall be prorated and adjusted as of such date.

                  (b)  Partial  Taking.  If  only a part  of the  Premises,  the
Building or the Real Property shall be acquired or condemned, this Lease and the
Term shall  continue in full force and effect,  provided that from and after the
date of the vesting of title,  the Fixed Rent,  Tenant's Tax  Payment,  Tenant's
Operating Payment and Tenant's  Proportionate Share shall be modified to reflect
the  reduction  of  the  Premises  and/or  the  Building  as a  result  of  such
acquisition or condemnation.

                  (c) Landlord's  Termination Right. Whether or not the Premises
are  affected,  Landlord may give to Tenant,  within 60 days  following the date
upon which Landlord receives notice that all or a portion of the Building or the
Real Property has been acquired or condemned,  a notice of  termination  of this
Lease,  provided that Landlord elects to terminate leases (including this Lease)
affecting at least  either (i) 33% of the portion of the  Building  occupied for
office purposes  immediately  prior to such  acquisition or condemnation or (ii)
50% of the rentable area of the Building  (excluding any rentable area leased by
Landlord or its Affiliates) located in the elevator bank servicing the Premises.

                  (d) Tenant's Termination Right. If the part of the Building or
the Real Property so acquired or condemned  contains a  substantial  part of the
total  area  of  the  Premises   immediately   prior  to  such   acquisition  or
condemnation,  or if, by reason of such acquisition or  condemnation,  Tenant no
longer has reasonable means of access to the Premises, Tenant may terminate this
Lease by notice to Landlord  given within 60 days  following the date upon which
Tenant  received  notice  of such  acquisition  or  condemnation.  If  Tenant so
notifies Landlord,  this Lease shall terminate and the Term shall end and expire
upon the date set forth in the notice, which date shall not be more than 30 days
following  the  giving of such  notice.  If a part of the  Premises  shall be so
acquired or  condemned  and this Lease and the Term shall not be  terminated  in
accordance with this Section 14.1, Landlord,  at Landlord's expense, but without
requiring Landlord to spend more than it collects as an award, shall, subject to
the  provisions  of any  Mortgage or Superior  Lease,  restore  that part of the
Premises  not  so  acquired  or  condemned  to  a  self-contained   rental  unit
substantially

37
<PAGE>

equivalent (with respect to character, quality, appearance and services) to that
which existed  immediately prior to such acquisition or condemnation,  excluding
Tenant's Property and/or Specialty Alterations.

                  (e)  Apportionment of Rent. Upon any termination of this Lease
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 14, Fixed Rent and payments for Taxes
and Operating Expenses shall be apportioned as of, and shall be paid or refunded
up to and including, the date of such termination.

                  (f)  Applicability.  The  provisions of Sections 14.1 and 14.2
shall not apply to any  acquisition  or  condemnation  of all or any part of the
Premises for a period of 12 months or less.

     Section 14.2 Awards.  Upon any  acquisition or  condemnation  of all or any
part of the Real Property,  Landlord shall receive the entire award for any such
acquisition or condemnation,  and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord or
the  condemning  authority for the value of any  unexpired  portion of the Term,
Tenant's Alterations or improvements;  and Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord all
of its right in and to such award. Nothing contained in this Article 14 shall be
deemed to  prevent  Tenant  from  making a  separate  claim in any  condemnation
proceedings for the then value of any Tenant's Property or Specialty  Alteration
included in such taking and for any moving expenses,  provided any such award is
in  addition  to,  and does not  result in a  reduction  of,  the award  made to
Landlord.

     Section 14.3 Temporary  Taking.  Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section
14.1,  if all or any part of the Premises is acquired or  condemned  temporarily
for a period of 12 months or less during the Term for any public or quasi-public
use or purpose,  Tenant shall give prompt  notice to Landlord and the Term shall
not be reduced or affected in any way and Tenant shall  continue to pay all Rent
payable by Tenant without reduction or abatement and to perform all of its other
obligations  under this Lease,  except to the extent  prevented from doing so by
the condemning  authority,  and Tenant shall be entitled to receive any award or
payment  from the  condemning  authority  for such  use,  which  award  shall be
received,  held and  applied by Tenant as a trust  fund for  payment of the Rent
falling due,  provided that if the  acquisition or  condemnation is for a period
extending beyond the Term, such award shall be apportioned  between Landlord and
Tenant and  Landlord  shall  receive the  portion of such award  relating to the
period after the Term. If the  acquisition or condemnation of all or any part of
the Premises is for a period of more than 12 months,  the provisions of Sections
14.1 and 14.2 shall apply.

                           ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING

     Section 15.1 (a) No Assignment or Subletting. Except as expressly set forth
herein,  Tenant  shall not assign,  mortgage,  pledge,  encumber,  or  otherwise
transfer  this Lease,  whether by operation of law or  otherwise,  and shall not
sublet (or underlet),  or permit,  or suffer the Premises or any part thereof to
be used or occupied by others  (whether for desk space,  mailing  privileges  or
otherwise),  without Landlord's prior consent in each instance.  Any assignment,
sublease,  mortgage,  pledge,  encumbrance or transfer in  contravention  of the
provisions of this Article 15 shall be void.

                  (b) Collection of Rent. If, without Landlord's  consent,  this
Lease is  assigned,  or any part of the Premises is sublet or occupied by anyone
other than Tenant or this Lease or the  Premises or any of Tenant's  Property is
encumbered  (by operation of law or  otherwise),  Landlord may collect rent from
the assignee,  subtenant or occupant,  and apply the net amount collected to the
Rent herein  reserved.  No such  collection  of rent shall be deemed to be (i) a
waiver of the provisions of this Article 15, (ii) an acceptance of the assignee,
subtenant  or  occupant  as  tenant,  or  (iii) a  release  of  Tenant  from the
performance of Tenant's  covenants  hereunder.  Tenant shall remain fully liable
for the obligations under this Lease.

                  (c) Further  Assignment/Subletting.  Landlord's consent to any
assignment or subletting  shall not relieve Tenant from the obligation to obtain
Landlord's express consent to any further assignment or subletting.  In no event
shall any permitted  subtenant assign or encumber its sublease or further sublet
any portion of its sublet  space,  or otherwise  suffer or permit any portion of
the sublet space to be used or occupied by others  without the prior  consent of
Landlord,  which  consent,  with  respect  to  one  further  subletting  by  the
subtenant,  shall be granted or  withheld by  Landlord  in  accordance  with the
requirements of this Article 15.

     Section 15.2 Tenant's Notice. (a) If Tenant desires to assign this Lease or
sublet all or any portion of the  Premises,  Tenant  shall give  notice  thereof
("Tenant's  A/S Notice") to  Landlord,  which shall be  accompanied  by (i) with
respect to an assignment of this Lease,  the date Tenant  desires the assignment
to be  effective,  and (ii)  with  respect  to a sublet  of all or a part of the
Premises,  (A) the  material  business  terms on which  Tenant would sublet such
premises,  and (B) a  description  of the portion of the  Premises to be sublet.
Such notice  shall be deemed an offer from Tenant to Landlord  whereby  Landlord
(or Landlord's  designee) shall be granted the right, at Landlord's  option, (1)
to  terminate  this Lease  with  respect  to such  space as Tenant  proposes  to
sublease, provided the term of the proposed sublease expires less than 18 months
before the Expiration Date, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth,
or  (2) if  the  proposed  transaction  is an  assignment  of  this  Lease  or a
subletting of 75% or more of the rentable  square  footage of the  Premises,  to
terminate  this

                                       39
<PAGE>

Lease with  respect to the entire  Premises.  Such  option may be  exercised  by
notice  from  Landlord  to Tenant  within 30 days  after  Landlord's  receipt of
Tenant's notice.

                  (b) Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Article 15
to the  contrary,  Tenant  named  herein shall have the right prior to the first
anniversary of the Rent  Commencement Date to sublet one or more portions of the
Premises not to exceed 7,500  rentable  square feet in the aggregate  (the "Free
Sublet  Space"),  in each  case,  without  any  obligation  to  comply  with the
provisions of Section 15.2(a). Such subleases by Tenant (i) shall not be subject
to  Landlord's  right to terminate  this Lease  pursuant to Section 15.3 hereof,
(ii) shall be subject to Landlord's  consent under Section 15.4, and (iii) shall
not be subject to the  provisions of Section 15.7 for rent payable in respect of
the first 5 years of any such sublease.

     Section 15.3 Landlord's  Termination.  If Landlord  exercises its option to
terminate  all or a portion of this Lease  pursuant  to Section  15.2:  (a) this
Lease shall end and expire with respect to all or a portion of the Premises,  as
the case may be, on the date that such  assignment  or sublease was to commence,
(b) Fixed Rent and Tenant's  payments for Taxes and Operating  Expenses shall be
apportioned,  paid or refunded  as of such date,  (c)  Tenant,  upon  Landlord's
request,  shall enter into an amendment of this Lease  ratifying and  confirming
such  total  or  partial   termination,   and  setting  forth  any   appropriate
modifications to the terms and provisions  hereof, (d) Landlord shall be free to
lease the Premises  (or any part  thereof) to Tenant's  prospective  assignee or
subtenant,  (e) if this  Lease  shall  end  with  respect  to a  portion  of the
Premises,  Tenant  shall,  at Tenant's sole cost and expense  (unless  otherwise
provided  in  Tenant's  A/S  Notice),  separately  demise  such  portion  of the
Premises,  and make available all utility services so as to make such portion of
the  Premises a  self-contained  rental  unit  satisfactory  in all  respects to
Landlord and in compliance with all  Requirements  and (f) Landlord shall return
to Tenant  the  Security  Deposit  or the  Letter of Credit (or in the case of a
partial termination,  a pro rata portion thereof) then held by Landlord provided
there is then no default under this Lease.

     Section 15.4 Conditions to Assignment/Subletting.  (a) If Landlord does not
exercise any of Landlord's  options  provided  under Section 15.2,  and provided
that no Event  of  Default  then  exists,  Landlord's  consent  to the  proposed
assignment or subletting  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed.  Such
consent  shall be granted or  denied,  as the case may be,  within 30 days after
Landlord's receipt of (i) a true and complete statement reasonably detailing the
identity of the proposed  assignee or subtenant,  the nature of its business and
its  proposed  use of the  Premises,  (ii) current  financial  information  with
respect  to the  proposed  assignee  or  subtenant,  including  its most  recent
financial  statements,  and (iii) any other information  Landlord may reasonably
request, provided that:

          (A) in  Landlord's  reasonable  judgment,  the  proposed  assignee  or
     subtenant  is engaged in a business or activity,  and the Premises  will be
     used in a manner,  which (1) is in keeping  with the then  standards of the
     Building, (2) limits the use of the Premises to the Permitted Uses, and (3)
     does not violate any  restrictions set forth in this Lease, any Mortgage or
     Superior Lease or any negative  covenant as to use of the Premises required
     by any other lease in the Building;

          (B) the proposed assignee or subtenant is a reputable Person or entity
     of good character  with  sufficient  financial  means to perform all of its
     obligations  under  this  Lease or the  sublease,  as the case may be,  and
     Landlord has been furnished with reasonable proof thereof,  and Landlord or
     any Affiliate of Landlord is not litigating  against or has been threatened
     with  litigation by such proposed  assignee of subtenant or its  Affiliates
     within the prior 6 months;

          (C) if Landlord has, or  reasonably  expects to have within six months
     thereafter,  comparable  space  available  in the  Building or an Adjoining
     Building,  neither the proposed  assignee or subtenant nor any Affiliate of
     the proposed assignee or subtenant is then an occupant of the Building;

          (D) the  proposed  assignee or subtenant is not a Person or entity (or
     Affiliate of a Person or entity) with whom Landlord or Landlord's  Agent is
     then,  or has been within the prior six months,  negotiating  in connection
     with the rental of space in the Building or an Adjoining Building;

          (E) the form of the  proposed  sublease or  instrument  of  assignment
     shall be  reasonably  satisfactory  to Landlord  and shall  comply with the
     provisions of this Article 15;

          (F) there  shall be not more  than 3  occupants  in each  floor of the
     Premises  (excluding  other tenants in the Building outside of the Premises
     on any such floor);

          (G) Tenant shall, upon demand,  reimburse  Landlord for all reasonable
     out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  Landlord  in  connection  with  such
     assignment   or  sublease,   including   any   investigations   as  to  the
     acceptability  of the proposed  assignee or subtenant,  reviewing any plans
     and  specifications  for  Alterations  proposed  to be made  in  connection
     therewith,  and all legal costs reasonably  incurred in connection with the
     granting of any requested consent, which costs and expenses, subject to the
     provisions of Section 5.6, shall not exceed $5,000.

          (H) Tenant has not and shall not  publicize  the  availability  of the
     Premises or list the Premises to be sublet or assigned with a broker, agent
     or other entity or otherwise  offer the Premises for subletting in any case
     at a rental rate of less than the rent at which  Landlord is then  offering
     to rent other space in the Building but the foregoing  provision  shall not
     be deemed to prohibit Tenant from responding to brokers'  solicitations and
     any other inquiries  regarding the proposed rental rate or

                                       41
<PAGE>


     from negotiating a sublease at a lesser rate of rent and consummating the
     same insofar as it may be permitted under the provisions of this
     Article 15;

          (I) if the proposed subtenant or assignee is an entity organized under
     the laws of any  jurisdiction  other  than the  United  States or any state
     thereof, or is not a United States citizen,  if an individual,  such Person
     shall waive any immunity to which it may entitled,  and shall be subject to
     the service of process in, and the  jurisdiction of the courts of, the City
     and State of New York; and

          (J) in  Landlord's  reasonable  judgment,  the  proposed  assignee  or
     subtenant shall not be of a type or character,  or engaged in a business or
     activity,  or owned or controlled by or identified  with any entity,  which
     may  result in  protests  or civil  disorders  or  commotions  at, or other
     disruptions of the normal business activities in, the Building.

     (b) With respect to each and every subletting and/or assignment  authorized
by Landlord under the provisions of this Lease, it is further agreed that:

          (i)  the  form  of  the  proposed  assignment  or  sublease  shall  be
     reasonably satisfactory to Landlord and shall comply with the provisions of
     this Article;

          (ii) no sublease  shall be for a term ending  later than one day prior
     to the Expiration Date of this Lease;

          (iii) no subtenant  shall take  possession of any part of the Premises
     until an  executed  counterpart  of such  sublease  has been  delivered  to
     Landlord and approved by Landlord as provided in Section 15.4(a);

          (iv) if an  Event of  Default  shall  occur  at any time  prior to the
     effective date of such assignment or subletting,  then  Landlord's  consent
     thereto, if previously granted, shall be immediately deemed revoked without
     further notice to Tenant,  and if such assignment or subletting  would have
     been permitted  without  Landlord's  consent pursuant to Section 15.8, such
     permission  shall be void and without force and effect,  and in either such
     case, any such assignment or subletting shall constitute a further Event of
     Default hereunder; and

          (v) each sublease  shall be subject and  subordinate to this Lease and
     to the matters to which this Lease is or shall be subordinate, it being the
     intention  of Landlord and Tenant that Tenant shall assume and be liable to
     Landlord for any and all acts and  omissions of all  subtenants  and anyone
     claiming under or through any subtenants  which, if performed or omitted by
     Tenant,  would be a default under this Lease; and Tenant and each subtenant
     shall be deemed to have  agreed  that upon the  occurrence  and  during the
     continuation of an Event of Default  hereunder,  Tenant has

                                       42
<PAGE>


     hereby assigned to Landlord,  and Landlord may, at its option,  accept such
     assignment of, all right, title and interest of Tenant as sublandlord under
     such  sublease,  together with all  modifications,  extensions and renewals
     thereof then in effect,  and such subtenant shall, at Landlord's option and
     upon  notice  from  Landlord,  attorn  to  Landlord  pursuant  to the  then
     executory  provisions  of this Lease other than the monetary  terms of this
     Lease,  which  monetary  terms  shall  be  governed  by the  terms  of such
     sublease, except that Landlord shall not be (A) liable for any previous act
     or omission of Tenant under such sublease, (B) subject to any counterclaim,
     offset or defense,  which  theretofore  accrued to such  subtenant  against
     Tenant,  (C)  bound  by any  previous  modification  of such  sublease  not
     consented to by  Landlord,  or by any  prepayment  of more than one month's
     rent and  additional  rent under such  sublease,  (D) bound to return  such
     subtenant's  security  deposit,  if any, except to the extent that Landlord
     shall receive actual possession of such deposit and such subtenant shall be
     entitled  to the  return of all or any  portion of such  deposit  under the
     terms of its sublease, or (E) obligated to make any payment to or on behalf
     of such  subtenant,  or to perform any work in the  subleased  space or the
     Building,  or in any way to  prepare  the  subleased  space for  occupancy,
     beyond  Landlord's  obligations  under this Lease.  The  provisions of this
     Section 15.4(b)(v) shall be self-operative, and no further instrument shall
     be required to give effect to this  provision,  provided that the subtenant
     shall  execute  and  deliver  to  Landlord  any  instruments  Landlord  may
     reasonably   request  to  evidence  and  confirm  such   subordination  and
     attornment.

     Section   15.5   Binding   on   Tenant;    Indemnification   of   Landlord.
Notwithstanding  any  assignment  or  subletting  or any  acceptance  of Rent by
Landlord  from any assignee or  subtenant,  Tenant shall remain fully liable for
the  payment  of all  Rent  due and  for the  performance  of all  other  terms,
covenants and conditions contained in this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed
and  performed,  and any default  under any term,  covenant or condition of this
Lease by any  subtenant  or  assignee  or anyone  claiming  under or through any
subtenant  or  assignee  shall be  deemed to be a default  under  this  Lease by
Tenant. Tenant shall indemnify,  defend, protect and hold harmless Landlord from
and against any and all Losses (as defined in Section  32.1(b))  resulting  from
any  claims  that may be made  against  Landlord  by the  proposed  assignee  or
subtenant or by any brokers or other  Persons  claiming a commission  or similar
compensation   in   connection   with  any  proposed   assignment  or  sublease,
irrespective  of whether  Landlord  shall give or decline to give its consent to
any proposed  assignment or sublease,  or if Landlord  shall exercise any of its
options under this Article 15.

     Section  15.6  Tenant's  Failure to  Complete.  If  Landlord  consents to a
proposed  assignment  or  sublease  and Tenant  fails to execute  and deliver to
Landlord  such  assignment  or sublease  within 90 days after the giving of such
consent,  then  Tenant  shall  again  comply  with  all  of the  provisions  and
conditions  of Sections  15.2 and 15.4  hereof  before  assigning  this Lease or
subletting all or part of the Premises.

                                       43
<PAGE>


     Section 15.7 Profits. If Tenant shall enter into any assignment or sublease
permitted hereunder or consented to by Landlord, Tenant shall, within 60 days of
Landlord's  consent  to such  assignment  or  sublease,  deliver  to  Landlord a
complete  list  of  Tenant's  reasonable   third-party   advertising   expenses,
reasonable brokerage,  legal and architectural fees, work allowances or costs of
improvements  performed by Tenant in connection with such assignment or sublease
and reasonable  rent  concessions  ("Tenant's  Expenses")  paid or to be paid in
connection  with  such  transaction,  together  with a list  of all of  Tenant's
Property to be transferred  to such assignee or sublessee.  Tenant shall deliver
to Landlord  evidence of the  payment of such fees  promptly  after the same are
paid. In  consideration  of such  assignment or subletting,  Tenant shall pay to
Landlord:

                  (a) In the case of an assignment, on the effective date of the
assignment,  an amount equal to 50% of all sums and other  consideration paid to
Tenant by the assignee for or by reason of such assignment  (including sums paid
for the  sale or  rental  of  Tenant's  Property,  less,  in the  case of a sale
thereof, the then unamortized cost thereof,  determined on the basis of Tenant's
federal  income  tax  returns)  after  first  deducting   Tenant's  Expenses  in
connection with such transaction; or

                  (b) In  the  case  of a  sublease,  50%  of any  consideration
payable  under the sublease to Tenant by the  subtenant  which  exceeds on a per
square foot basis the Fixed Rent and Additional Rent accruing during the term of
the sublease in respect of the subleased  space (together with any sums paid for
the sale or rental of Tenant's Property,  less, in the case of the sale thereof,
the then unamortized  cost thereof,  determined on the basis of Tenant's federal
income tax returns) after first deducting  Tenant's  Expenses in connection with
such transaction.  The sums payable under this clause shall be paid by Tenant to
Landlord as and when paid by the subtenant to Tenant.

     Section 15.8 (a) Transfers. If Tenant is a corporation, the transfer by one
or more transfers,  directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, of
a majority of the stock of Tenant shall be deemed a voluntary assignment of this
Lease; provided, however, that the provisions of this Article 15 shall not apply
to the  transfer  of  shares  of stock of  Tenant  if and so long as  Tenant  is
publicly traded on a nationally recognized stock exchange.  For purposes of this
Section 15.8 the term "transfers" shall be deemed to include the issuance of new
stock or of treasury  stock  which  results in a majority of the stock of Tenant
being  held by a Person or Persons  that do not hold a majority  of the stock of
Tenant on the date hereof.  If Tenant is a  partnership,  the transfer by one or
more transfers,  directly or indirectly,  by operation of law or otherwise, of a
majority interest in the partnership or otherwise in violation of the provisions
of Section 29.2 shall be deemed a voluntary  assignment of this Lease. If Tenant
is a limited  liability  company,  trust, or any other legal entity (including a
corporation or a partnership),  the transfer by one or more transfers,  directly
or indirectly, of Control of such entity, however characterized, shall be deemed
a voluntary assignment of this Lease. The provisions of Sections 15.1(a),  15.2,
15.3,  15.4(a) and 15.7 shall not apply to  transactions  with an entity into or
with which Tenant is merged or  consolidated  or to which  substantially

                                       44
<PAGE>

all of Tenant's assets are transferred so long as (i) such transfer was made for
a  legitimate   independent   business  purpose  and  not  for  the  purpose  of
transferring  this Lease,  (ii) the successor to Tenant has a net worth computed
in accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles at least equal to
ten times the annual Fixed Rent,  Tenant's  Tax Payment and  Tenant's  Operating
Payment then payable  pursuant to this Lease,  and (iii) proof  satisfactory  to
Landlord  of such net worth is  delivered  to Landlord at least 10 days prior to
the effective  date of any such  transaction.  Tenant may also upon prior notice
to, but without the consent,  of Landlord permit any Person which  Controls,  is
Controlled by, or is under common Control with the original  Tenant named herein
(a "Related Entity") to sublet all or part of the Premises for any Permitted Use
for so long as such Person remains a Related Entity, provided the Related Entity
is in  Landlord's  reasonable  judgment of a character and engaged in a business
which is in  keeping  with the  standards  for the  Building  and the  occupancy
thereof.  Such sublease  shall not be deemed to vest in any such Related  Entity
any right or  interest  in this  Lease or the  Premises  nor  shall it  relieve,
release, impair or discharge any of Tenant's obligations hereunder.

                  (b)  Applicability.  The limitations set forth in this Section
15.8 shall apply to subtenant(s), assignee(s) and guarantor(s) of this Lease, if
any, and any transfer by any such entity in violation of this Section 15.8 shall
be a transfer in violation of Section 15.1.

                  (c)  Modifications,  Takeover  Agreements.  Any  modification,
amendment  or  extension  of a sublease  and/or any other  agreement  by which a
landlord (or its  affiliate)  of a building  other than the  Building  agrees to
assume or perform the  obligations  of Tenant under this Lease shall be deemed a
sublease for the purposes of Section 15.1 hereof.

     Section 15.9 Assumption of Obligations. Any assignment or transfer, whether
made with Landlord's consent or without Landlord's consent, if and to the extent
permitted  hereunder,  shall not be  effective  unless  and  until the  assignee
executes,  acknowledges  and  delivers to Landlord  (a) an agreement in form and
substance  satisfactory  to Landlord  whereby the assignee (i) assumes  Tenant's
obligations  under  this  Lease  and  (ii)  agrees  that,  notwithstanding  such
assignment or transfer,  the  provisions of Section 15.1 hereof shall be binding
upon it in respect of all future  assignments and transfers and (b) certificates
or policies of insurance as required under Article 12.

     Section 15.10 Tenant's Liability. The joint and several liability of Tenant
and any  successors-in-interest  of Tenant and the due  performance  of Tenant's
obligations  under this Lease shall not be  discharged,  released or impaired by
any  agreement or  stipulation  made by Landlord,  or any grantee or assignee of
Landlord,  extending the time,  or modifying any of the terms and  provisions of
this Lease, or by any waiver or failure of Landlord,  or any grantee or assignee
of Landlord, to enforce any of the terms and provisions of this Lease.

     Section 15.11 Listings in Building Directory. The listing of any name other
than that of Tenant on the doors of the  Premises,  the  Building  directory  or
elsewhere shall not vest

                                       45
<PAGE>

any  right or  interest  in this  Lease or in the  Premises,  nor be  deemed  to
constitute  Landlord's consent to any assignment or transfer of this Lease or to
any sublease of the Premises or to the use or occupancy  thereof by others.  Any
such listing shall constitute a privilege revocable in Landlord's  discretion by
notice to Tenant.

     Section 15.12 Lease  Disaffirmance  or  Rejection.  If at any time after an
assignment by Tenant named herein, this Lease is not affirmed or rejected in any
proceeding  of the types  described  in  Sections  18.1(e) and (f) hereof or any
similar  proceeding,  or  upon a  termination  of  this  Lease  due to any  such
proceeding,  Tenant named herein,  upon request of Landlord given within 30 days
after such disaffirmance, rejection or termination (and actual notice thereof to
Landlord  in the  event  of a  disaffirmance  or  rejection  or in the  event of
termination  other than by act of Landlord),  shall (a) pay to Landlord all Rent
and other charges due and owing by the assignee to Landlord  under this Lease to
and including the date of such disaffirmance,  rejection or termination, and (b)
as  "tenant,"  enter into a new lease of the Premises  with  Landlord for a term
commencing on the effective date of such disaffirmance, rejection or termination
and ending on the  Expiration  Date,  unless  sooner  terminated  in  accordance
therewith,  at the same Rent and upon the then  executory  terms,  covenants and
conditions  contained in this Lease,  except that (i) the rights of Tenant named
herein  under the new lease  shall be  subject to the  possessory  rights of any
Persons  claiming  through or under such assignee or by virtue of any statute or
of any order of any  court,  (ii)  such new lease  shall  require  all  defaults
existing under this Lease to be cured by Tenant named herein with due diligence,
and (iii)  such new lease  shall  require  Tenant  named  herein to pay all Rent
which,  had this Lease not been so  disaffirmed,  rejected or terminated,  would
have  become  due  under the  provisions  of this  Lease  after the date of such
disaffirmance,  rejection  or  termination  with  respect  to any  period  prior
thereto.  If Tenant named herein  defaults in its obligations to enter into such
new lease for a period of 10 days after Landlord's request, then, in addition to
all other rights and remedies by reason of default,  either at law or in equity,
Landlord shall have the same rights and remedies  against Tenant named herein as
if it had  entered  into such new lease and such new lease had  thereafter  been
terminated  as of the  commencement  date thereof by reason of Tenant's  default
thereunder.

                                   ELECTRICITY

     Section 16.1 (a) Submetered  Electricity.  Landlord shall  redistribute  or
furnish  electricity  to or for  the  use of  Tenant  in the  Premises  for  the
operation of Tenant's  electrical  systems and equipment in the  Premises,  at a
level sufficient to accommodate a demand load of six (6) watts per usable square
foot of office  space in the  Premises  (exclusive  of  electricity  required to
operate the base-Building HVAC System).  Tenant shall pay to Landlord, on demand
from time to time, but not more than monthly, for its consumption of electricity
at the  Premises,  as  Additional  Rent for such  service  from  and  after  the
Construction  Period

                                       46

Start Date, a sum equal to 107% of the product  obtained by multiplying  (x) the
Cost Per Kilowatt  Hour, by (y) the actual number of kilowatt  hours of electric
current  consumed by Tenant in such billing  period.  Landlord  shall  install a
meter or meters,  at Landlord's  expense,  to measure  Tenant's  consumption  of
electricity in the Premises, which meters shall be maintained by Landlord. Where
more  than  one  meter  measures  Tenant's  consumption  of  electricity  in the
Premises,  the electricity  measured by each meter shall be computed  separately
but billed together in accordance with the provisions set forth above. Bills for
such  amounts  shall be rendered to Tenant at such times as Landlord  may elect.
The rate to be paid by Tenant for submetered electricity shall include any taxes
or other charges in connection therewith.  If any tax is imposed upon Landlord's
receipts  from the  sale or  resale  of  electricity  to  Tenant,  Tenant  shall
reimburse  Landlord for such tax, if and to the extent permitted by law. For any
period  during  which  such  meter  or  meters  are  not  installed  or are  not
operational  in the  Premises,  the monthly  Fixed Rent shall be increased by an
amount  equal to the  product  of (A)  $.2083,  subject  to  adjustment  for any
increases in electric rates or taxes, and (B) the number of rentable square feet
in the Premises.

     Section 16.2 Excess Electricity.  Tenant shall at all times comply with the
rules and  regulations  of the  utility  company  supplying  electricity  to the
Building.  Subject to Tenant's  right to use the electric  capacity set forth in
Section 16.1, Tenant shall not use any electrical equipment which, in Landlord's
judgment,  would exceed the  capacity of the  electrical  equipment  serving the
Premises  or  interfere  with the  electrical  service  to other  tenants of the
Building.  Tenant shall not make or perform, or permit the making or performance
of, any Alterations to wiring installations or other electrical facilities in or
serving the  Premises or make any  additions  to the office  equipment  or other
appliances in the Premises which utilize  electrical energy (other than ordinary
small office equipment) without the prior consent of Landlord, in each instance,
in compliance with Article 5 of this Lease.

     Section 16.3 Service Disruption. Landlord shall not be liable in any way to
Tenant for any  failure,  defect or  interruption  of, or change in the  supply,
character and/or quantity of electric service  furnished to the Premises for any
reason  except if  attributable  to the  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  of
Landlord,  nor shall there be any allowance to Tenant for a diminution of rental
value,  nor shall the same  constitute  an actual or  constructive  eviction  of
Tenant,  in  whole  or in  part,  or  relieve  Tenant  from  any  of  its  Lease
obligations,  and no liability  shall arise on the part of Landlord by reason of
inconvenience,  annoyance or injury to business whether  electricity is provided
by public or private utility or by any electricity  generation  system owned and
operated  by  Landlord.  Landlord  shall  use  reasonable  efforts  to  minimize
interference  with Tenant's use and occupancy of the Premises as a result of any
such  failure,  defect or  interruption  of, or change in the supply,  character
and/or  quantity of,  electric  service,  provided that  Landlord  shall have no
obligation to employ contractors or labor at overtime or other premium pay rates
or to incur any other overtime costs or additional expenses whatsoever.

     Section  16.4  Discontinuance  of Service.  Landlord  reserves the right to
discontinue furnishing electricity to Tenant in the Premises on not less than 30
days  notice to Tenant,  if  Landlord  discontinues  furnishing  electricity  to
tenants  (including Tenant) leasing an aggregate of at least 50% of the rentable
area of the Building, or is required to do so under applicable Requirements.  If
Landlord  exercises  such  right,  or is  compelled  to  discontinue  furnishing
electricity  to Tenant,  this Lease shall  continue in full force and effect and
shall be unaffected  thereby,  except that from and after the effective  date of
such  discontinuance,  Landlord shall not be obligated to furnish electricity to
Tenant hereunder.  If Landlord so discontinues  furnishing  electricity,  Tenant
shall arrange to obtain  electricity  directly from any utility company or other
electricity provider serving the Premises.  Such electricity may be furnished to
Tenant by means of the existing electrical  facilities serving the Premises,  at
no charge by  Landlord,  to the  extent  available,  suitable  and safe for such
purposes.  All other  equipment  which may be required to obtain  electricity of
substantially  the same  quantity,  quality and character  shall be installed by
Landlord at the sole cost and expense of (a) Landlord,  if Landlord  voluntarily
discontinues  such  service,  or (b) Tenant,  if (i)  Landlord is  compelled  to
discontinue  such  service  by the  public  utility or  pursuant  to  applicable
Requirements or (ii) if such discontinuance  arises out of the acts of omissions
of Tenant.  Landlord shall not voluntarily discontinue furnishing electricity to
Tenant until  Tenant is able to receive  electricity  directly  from the utility
company or other company  servicing the Building,  unless the utility company or
other company is not prepared to furnish electricity to the Premises on the date
required as a result of Tenant's delay or negligence in arranging for service or
Tenant's  refusal to provide the utility company or other company with a deposit
or other security  requested by the utility company or other company or Tenant's
refusal  to take any other  action  requested  by the  utility  company or other
company.

                               ACCESS TO PREMISES

     Section  17.1  Landlord's   Access.   (a)  Tenant  shall  permit  Landlord,
Landlord's agents,  utility companies and other service providers  servicing the
Building to erect, use and maintain ducts, pipes and conduits in and through the
Premises  provided such use does not cause the usable area of the Premises to be
reduced beyond an immaterial  amount.  Landlord shall promptly repair any damage
to the Premises or Tenant's  Property  caused by any work performed  pursuant to
this Article. Any pipes, ducts, or conduits installed in or through the Premises
pursuant to this  Section  17.1 shall  either be  concealed  behind,  beneath or
within then existing  partitioning,  columns,  ceilings or floors located in the
Premises,  or  completely  furred at points  immediately  adjacent  to  existing
partitioning  columns  or  ceilings  located  in the  Premises.  Subject  to the
provisions of Article 4.4,  Landlord  shall use  reasonable  efforts to minimize
interference  with  Tenant's  use  and  occupancy  of the  Premises  during  the
performance of such work.

                  (b)  Landlord,  any Lessor or  Mortgagee  and any other  party
designated by Landlord and their respective agents shall have the right to enter
the Premises at all reasonable  times,  upon reasonable notice (which notice may
be oral) except in the case of emergency,  (i) to examine the Premises,  (ii) to
show the  Premises  to  prospective  purchasers,  Mortgagees  or  Lessors of the
Building and their respective agents and  representatives  or others, and during
the last 12  months  of the  Term to  prospective  lessees  of  premises  in the
Building  and  (iii) to make  such  repairs,  alterations  or  additions  to the
Premises or the Building (A) as Landlord may deem necessary or appropriate,  (B)
which Landlord may elect to perform  following  Tenant's failure to perform,  or
(C) to comply with any  Requirements,  and Landlord shall be allowed to take all
material into the Premises that may be required for the performance of such work
without the same  constituting an actual or  constructive  eviction of Tenant in
whole or in part and without any  abatement of Rent.  During any such entry into
the  Premises  pursuant to this  Section  17.1(b),  Tenant  shall have the right
(unless such entry is  necessitated  by an emergency)  to have a  representative
accompany  the  party  entering  the  Premises  but the  failure  to  make  such
representative available shall not affect Landlord's right to enter the Premises
as aforesaid.

                  (c) All parts  (except  surfaces  facing the  interior  of the
Premises)  of all walls,  windows and doors  bounding  the  Premises,  including
exterior  Building walls,  exterior core corridor walls, and doors and entrances
(other than doors and entrances  solely  connecting  areas within the Premises),
all  balconies,  terraces and roofs  adjacent to the  Premises,  all space in or
adjacent to the Premises used for shafts, stacks, risers, fan rooms,  electrical
and communication closets, stairways, mail chutes, conduits and other mechanical
facilities,  Building  Systems  and  Building  facilities  are  not  part of the
Premises, and Landlord shall have the use thereof and access thereto through the
Premises for the purposes of Building  operation,  maintenance,  alteration  and
repair.

     Section  17.2  Final 2 Months.  If,  during  the last 2 months of the Term,
Tenant removes all or substantially  all of Tenant's Property from the Premises,
Landlord  may,  upon prior notice  (which  notice may be oral) and at reasonable
hours, renovate and/or redecorate the Premises, without abatement of any Rent or
incurring  any  liability to Tenant.  Such acts shall not be deemed an actual or
constructive  eviction  and shall have no effect upon this Lease.

     Section 17.3 Alterations to Building. Landlord has the right at any time to
(a) change the name,  number or  designation  by which the  Building is commonly
known,  or (b) alter the  Building  to change the  arrangement  or  location  of
entrances or passageways, concourses, plazas, doors and doorways, and corridors,
elevators,  stairs,  toilets,  or other public parts of the Building without any
such acts constituting an actual or constructive  eviction and without incurring
any  liability to Tenant,  so long as such changes do not deny Tenant  access to
the Premises.  Landlord  shall use reasonable  efforts to minimize  interference
with  Tenant's  use and  occupancy  of the  Premises  during  the making of such
changes or  alterations,  provided  that  Landlord  shall have no  obligation to
employ  contractors

or labor at overtime or other  premium pay rates or to incur any other  overtime
costs or additional expenses whatsoever.

     Section 18.1 Tenant's  Defaults.  Each of the following  events shall be an
"Event of Default" hereunder:

                  (a) Tenant fails to pay when due any installment of Fixed Rent
or  Additional  Rent and such default  continues  for three  Business Days after
notice of such  default is given to Tenant,  except that if Landlord  shall have
given two such notices of default in the payment of any Rent in any  consecutive
twelve  month  period,  Tenant  shall not be entitled  to any further  notice of
delinquency  in the payment of any Rent or an  extended  period in which to make
payment until such time as twelve  consecutive months shall have elapsed without
Tenant  having  failed to make any such payment when due, and the  occurrence of
any default in the payment of any Rent within such twelve month period after the
giving of two such notices shall constitute an Event of Default; or

                  (b) Tenant  defaults in the  observance or  performance of any
other term,  covenant or  condition of this Lease to be observed or performed by
Tenant and such default continues for more than 30 days after notice by Landlord
to Tenant of such default; or if such default is of such a nature that it can be
remedied  but cannot be  completely  remedied  within 30 days,  Tenant  fails to
commence  to remedy  such  default  within 30 days  after such  notice or,  with
respect to any such default, Tenant, having commenced such remedy within 30 days
after  such  notice,  fails to  diligently  prosecute  to  completion  all steps
necessary to remedy such default; or

                  (c) Tenant's interest in this Lease shall devolve upon or pass
to any Person, whether by operation of law or otherwise, in violation of Article
15; or

                  (d) Tenant  admits in writing its  inability to, pay its debts
as they become due; or

                  (e)  Tenant  files  a  voluntary  petition  in  bankruptcy  or
insolvency,  or is adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or files any petition or
answer seeking any  reorganization,  liquidation,  dissolution or similar relief
under any  present  or future  federal  bankruptcy  act or any other  present or
future applicable federal, state or other statute or law, or makes an assignment
for the  benefit of  creditors  or seeks or  consents  to or  acquiesces  in the
appointment of any trustee,  receiver,  liquidator or other similar official for
Tenant or for all or any part of Tenant's property; or

<PAGE>


                  (f)  if,  within  90  days  after  the   commencement  of  any
proceeding  against  Tenant,  whether by the filing of a petition or  otherwise,
seeking  bankruptcy,  insolvency,   reorganization,   arrangement,  composition,
readjustment,  liquidation,  dissolution  or similar relief under the present or
any future  federal  bankruptcy  act or any other  present or future  applicable
federal,  state or other  statute or law,  such  proceeding  shall not have been
dismissed, or if, within 90 days after the appointment of any trustee, receiver,
liquidator  or  other  similar  official  for  Tenant  or for all or any part of
Tenant's  property,   without  the  consent  or  acquiescence  of  Tenant,  such
appointment shall not have been vacated or otherwise discharged, or if any lien,
execution or attachment or other similar  filing shall be made or issued against
Tenant or any of Tenant's property pursuant to which the Premises shall be taken
or occupied or attempted  to be taken or occupied by someone  other than Tenant;
or

                  (g) if Landlord  applies or retains  any part of the  Security
Deposit,  and Tenant  fails to deposit  with  Landlord  the amount so applied or
retained by Landlord, or to provide Landlord with a replacement Letter of Credit
(as defined in Section 35.2), if applicable, within 5 Business Days after notice
by Landlord to Tenant stating the amount applied or retained.

Upon the occurrence of any one or more of such Events of Default,  Landlord may,
at its sole option,  give to Tenant three days' notice of  cancellation  of this
Lease,  in which  event  this Lease and the Term shall come to an end and expire
(whether or not the Term shall have commenced) upon the expiration of such three
day period with the same force and effect as if the date set forth in the notice
was the Expiration Date stated herein;  and Tenant shall then quit and surrender
the Premises to Landlord, but Tenant shall remain liable for damages as provided
in Article 19 hereof.

     Section  18.2  Tenant's  Liability.  If, at any time,  (a) Tenant  shall be
comprised  of two or more  persons,  (b) Tenant's  obligations  under this Lease
shall have been  guaranteed  by any person  other than  Tenant,  or (c) Tenant's
interest in this Lease shall have been  assigned,  the word "Tenant," as used in
Section  18.1 (d),  (e) and (f),  shall be deemed to mean any one or more of the
Persons  primarily or  secondarily  liable for Tenant's  obligations  under this
Lease.  Any monies  received by Landlord  from or on behalf of Tenant during the
pendency of any  proceeding  of the types  referred to in this Article  shall be
deemed paid as  compensation  for the use and  occupancy of the Premises and the
acceptance  of  any  such  compensation  by  Landlord  shall  not be  deemed  an
acceptance  of Rent or a waiver on the part of Landlord of any rights under this
Lease.

                              REMEDIES AND DAMAGES

     Section 19.1 (a) Landlord's  Remedies.  If any Event of Default occurs, and
this Lease and the Term terminates as provided in Article 18:

               (i) Surrender of Possession.  Tenant shall quit and surrender the
          Premises to Landlord, and Landlord and its agents may immediately,  or
          at any time after such Event of Default,  re-enter the Premises or any
          part thereof, without notice, either by summary proceedings, or by any
          other  applicable  action or  proceeding,  or by force (to the  extent
          permitted by law) or otherwise in  accordance  with  applicable  legal
          proceedings  (without  being  liable  to  indictment,  prosecution  or
          damages  therefor),  and may  repossess  the Premises  and  dispossess
          Tenant and any other  Persons from the Premises and remove any and all
          of their property from the Premises.

               (ii) Landlord's  Reletting.  Landlord,  at Landlord's option, may
          relet all or any part of the Premises from time to time, either in the
          name of Landlord or otherwise, to such tenant or tenants, for any term
          ending  before,  on or after the  Expiration  Date, at such rental and
          upon such other  conditions  (which may include  concessions  and free
          rent  periods) as Landlord,  in its sole  discretion,  may  determine.
          Landlord  shall  have no  obligation  to and shall  not be liable  for
          refusal or  failure  to relet or, in the event of any such  reletting,
          for  refusal  or  failure  to  collect  any  rent  due  upon  any such
          reletting;  and no such refusal or failure shall relieve Tenant of, or
          otherwise  affect,  any  liability  under  this  Lease.  Landlord,  at
          Landlord's  option,  may make such alterations,  decorations and other
          physical  changes  in and to the  Premises  as  Landlord,  in its sole
          discretion,  considers  advisable or necessary in connection with such
          reletting  or  proposed  reletting,  without  relieving  Tenant of any
          liability under this Lease or otherwise affecting any such liability.

          (b) Tenant's  Waiver.  Tenant,  on its own behalf and on behalf of all
     persons claiming through or under Tenant,  including all creditors,  hereby
     waives all rights which Tenant and all such Persons  might  otherwise  have
     under any  Requirement  (i) to the  service of any notice of  intention  to
     re-enter or to institute legal proceedings,  (ii) to redeem, or to re-enter
     or repossess the Premises, or (iii) to restore the operation of this Lease,
     after (A) Tenant shall have been  dispossessed or ejected by judgment or by
     warrant of any court or judge,  (B) any  re-entry by  Landlord,  or (C) any
     expiration  or early  termination  of the term of this Lease,  whether such
     dispossession, re-entry, expiration or termination shall be by operation of
     law or pursuant to the  provisions  of this  Lease.  The words  "re-enter,"
     "re-entry" and "re-entered" as used in this Lease shall not be deemed to be
     restricted to their technical legal meanings.

          (c) Other Remedies. Upon the breach or threatened breach by Tenant, or
     any persons  claiming  through or under  Tenant,  of any term,  covenant or
     condition  of this  Lease,  Landlord  shall  have the right to enjoin  such
     breach  and to invoke  any other  remedy  allowed by

                                       52
<PAGE>

     law or in equity as if  re-entry,  summary  proceedings  and other  special
     remedies  were not  provided in this Lease for such  breach.  The rights to
     invoke the remedies set forth above are  cumulative  and shall not preclude
     Landlord from invoking any other remedy allowed at law or in equity.

     Section 19.2 (a) Landlord's  Damages. If this Lease and the Term expire and
come to an end as provided in Article 18, or by or under any summary  proceeding
or any other action or proceeding, or if Landlord shall re-enter the Premises as
provided in Section 19.1, then, in any of such events:

               (i) Tenant  shall pay to  Landlord  all Rent  payable  under this
          Lease by Tenant to Landlord up to the  Expiration  Date or to the date
          of re-entry upon the Premises by Landlord, as the case may be;

               (ii)  Landlord  shall be entitled  to retain all monies,  if any,
          paid by Tenant to  Landlord,  whether as prepaid  Rent,  the  Security
          Deposit or  otherwise,  and to draw upon any Letter of Credit or other
          security  deposited  by  Tenant  hereunder  and  retain  the  proceeds
          thereof,  which monies, to the extent not otherwise applied to amounts
          due and owing to Landlord,  shall be credited by Landlord  against any
          damages payable by Tenant to Landlord;

               (iii) Tenant shall pay to Landlord, in monthly  installments,  on
          the days specified in this Lease for payment of  installments of Fixed
          Rent,  any  Deficiency;  it being  understood  that Landlord  shall be
          entitled to recover the Deficiency  from Tenant each month as the same
          shall arise,  and no suit to collect the amount of the  Deficiency for
          any month, shall prejudice  Landlord's right to collect the Deficiency
          for any subsequent month by a similar proceeding; and

               (iv) whether or not  Landlord  shall have  collected  any monthly
          Deficiency,  Tenant shall pay to Landlord,  on demand,  in lieu of any
          further  Deficiency and as liquidated and agreed final damages,  a sum
          equal to the amount by which the Rent for the period  which  otherwise
          would have  constituted  the unexpired  portion of the Term  (assuming
          Additional  Rent during such period to be the same as had been payable
          for the year  immediately  preceding  such  termination  or  re-entry,
          increased  in  each  succeeding  year by 4% (on a  compounded  basis))
          exceeds the then fair and reasonable rental value of the Premises, for
          the same period (with both amounts  being  discounted to present value
          at a rate of  interest  equal to 2% below the then Base Rate) less the
          aggregate  amount of  Deficiencies  theretofore  collected by Landlord
          pursuant  to the  provisions  of  Section  19.2(a)(iii)  for the  same
          period. If, before presentation of proof of such liquidated damages to
          any court,  commission or tribunal, the Premises, or any part thereof,
          shall have been relet by Landlord for the period which otherwise would
          have  constituted  the  unexpired  portion  of the  Term,  or any part
          thereof,  the amount of rent  reserved  upon such  reletting  shall be
          deemed,  prima

                                       53
<PAGE>

          facie, to be the fair and reasonable  rental value for the part or the
          whole of the Premises so relet during the term of the reletting.

          (b) Reletting.  If the Premises,  or any part thereof,  shall be relet
     together with other space in the Building,  the rents collected or reserved
     under any such  reletting and the expenses of any such  reletting  shall be
     equitably  apportioned for the purposes of this Section 19.2.  Tenant shall
     not be  entitled to any rents  collected  or payable  under any  reletting,
     whether or not such rents  exceed the Fixed Rent  reserved  in this  Lease.
     Nothing contained in Articles 18 or 19 shall be deemed to limit or preclude
     the recovery by Landlord  from Tenant of the maximum  amount  allowed to be
     obtained  as  damages  under  applicable  Requirements,  or of any  sums or
     damages to which  Landlord  may be  entitled in addition to the damages set
     forth in this Section 19.2.

     Section  19.3  Default  Interest;  Other  Rights of  Landlord.  Any damages
payable  under  this  Lease  and not paid when due shall  bear  interest  at the
Interest  Rate from the due date until paid,  and the  interest  shall be deemed
Additional Rent. If Tenant fails to pay any Additional Rent when due,  Landlord,
in  addition  to any other  right or  remedy,  shall  have the same  rights  and
remedies as in the case of a default by Tenant in the payment of Fixed Rent.  If
Tenant is in arrears in the payment of Rent,  Tenant waives  Tenant's  right, if
any, to designate  the items against which any payments made by Tenant are to be
credited,  and  Landlord  may  apply  any  payments  made by Tenant to any items
Landlord sees fit,  regardless of any request by Tenant.  Landlord  reserves the
right,  without  liability  to  Tenant  and  without  constituting  any claim of
constructive eviction, to suspend furnishing or rendering to Tenant any overtime
Building  services or labor,  materials or other  property or services for which
Tenant is  obligated  to pay a  separate  charge  under  this  Lease  (excluding
electricity and water), in the event that (but only for so long as) Tenant is in
arrears  in paying  Landlord  for such  items for more than five (5) days  after
notice from Landlord to Tenant demanding the payment of such arrears.

                   LANDLORD'S RIGHT TO CURE; FEES AND EXPENSES

     If Tenant defaults in the performance of its obligations  under this Lease,
Landlord,  without thereby waiving such default, may perform such obligation for
the  account  and at the  expense  of  Tenant:  (a)  immediately  or at any time
thereafter,  and without  notice,  in the case of  emergency  or in the case the
default (i) materially  interferes with the use by any other tenant of any space
in the Building,  (ii) materially interferes with the efficient operation of the
Building, (iii) will result in a violation of any Requirement,  (iv) will result
in a cancellation of any insurance  policy  maintained by Landlord,  or (v) will
result in a breach of or default under any Superior  Lease or Mortgage,  and (b)
in any other case if such default continues after 10 days from the date Landlord
gives notice of Landlord's intention so to

perform the defaulted obligation. All costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in
connection  with any such  performance  by it for the  account of Tenant and all
costs  and  expenses,  including  reasonable  counsel  fees  and  disbursements,
incurred  by  Landlord  in any  action  or  proceeding  (including  any  summary
dispossess  proceeding)  brought by Landlord to enforce any obligation of Tenant
under this Lease and/or right of Landlord in or to the  Premises,  shall be paid
by Tenant to Landlord on demand, with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from
the date incurred by Landlord.  Except as expressly  provided to the contrary in
this Lease, all costs and expenses which,  pursuant to this Lease (including the
Rules and  Regulations)  are  incurred  by  Landlord  and payable to Landlord by
Tenant, and all charges,  amounts and sums payable to Landlord by Tenant for any
property,  material,  labor,  utility or other services which,  pursuant to this
Lease or at the request and for the account of Tenant,  are provided,  furnished
or rendered by  Landlord,  shall become due and payable by Tenant to Landlord in
accordance with the terms of the bills rendered by Landlord to Tenant.

               NO REPRESENTATIONS BY LANDLORD: LANDLORD'S APPROVAL

     Section  21.1 No  Representations.  Except as expressly  set forth  herein,
Landlord  and  Landlord's  agents  have  made  no  warranties,  representations,
statements  or promises with respect to (i) the rentable and usable areas of the
Premises or the  Building,  (ii) the amount of any  current or future  Operating
Expenses or Taxes,  (iii) the compliance  with  applicable  Requirements  of the
Premises  or the  Building,  or (iv) the  suitability  of the  Premises  for any
particular  use or purpose.  No rights,  easements  or licenses  are acquired by
Tenant under this Lease by  implication  or  otherwise.  Tenant is entering into
this Lease after full  investigation  and is not relying  upon any  statement or
representation made by Landlord not embodied in this Lease.

     Section 21.2 Consents; Approvals. All consents or approvals of Landlord may
be granted  or  withheld  in  Landlord's  sole  discretion  unless  specifically
provided to the contrary in this Lease.

     Section 21.3 No Money Damages. Wherever in this Lease Landlord's consent or
approval is  required,  if Landlord  refuses to grant such  consent or approval,
whether or not Landlord expressly agreed that such consent or approval would not
be unreasonably  withheld,  Tenant shall not make, and Tenant hereby waives, any
claim for money damages (including any claim by way of set-off,  counterclaim or
defense)  based upon  Tenant's  claim or assertion  that  Landlord  unreasonably
withheld or delayed its consent or  approval.  Tenant's  sole remedy shall be an
action or  proceeding  to  enforce  such  provision,  by  specific  performance,
injunction or  declaratory  judgment.  In no event shall Landlord be liable for,
and Tenant, on behalf of itself and all other Tenant Parties,  hereby waives any
claim for, any indirect,  consequential or punitive  damages,  including loss of
profits or business opportunity,


                                       55

arising  under  or in  connection  with  this  Lease,  even if due to the  gross
negligence  or  willful  misconduct  of  Landlord  or its  agents or  employees.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 21.3 to the contrary,  Tenant
shall have the right to submit to  arbitration  in  accordance  with  Article 39
hereof any dispute in respect of whether Landlord has unreasonably  withheld any
consent or approval to any Alteration  pursuant to Section 5.1 or any assignment
or  subletting  pursuant to Section  15.5  requested by Tenant  hereunder  which
Landlord agreed not to unreasonably withhold hereunder, and Tenant's sole remedy
in all such  circumstances  shall be that,  upon the decision of the  arbitrator
that consent was unreasonably  withheld, the requested consent or approval shall
be deemed to have been granted as provided above without any further proceedings
or any action being required.


                                   ARTICLE 22

                                   END OF TERM

     Section 22.1 Expiration.  Upon the expiration or other  termination of this
Lease, Tenant shall quit and surrender the Premises to Landlord,  vacant,  broom
clean and in good  order and  condition,  ordinary  wear and tear and damage for
which  Tenant is not  responsible  under the terms of this Lease  excepted,  and
Tenant shall remove all of Tenant's Property and Tenant's  Alterations as may be
required  pursuant to Article 5 of this Lease.  The foregoing  obligation  shall
survive the expiration or sooner termination of the Term. If the last day of the
Term or any renewal thereof falls on Saturday or Sunday, this Lease shall expire
on the immediately preceding Business Day.

     Section 22.2 Holdover Rent.  Landlord and Tenant  recognize that the damage
to Landlord resulting from any failure by Tenant to timely surrender  possession
of the  Premises  may  be  substantial,  may  exceed  the  amount  of  the  Rent
theretofore  payable  hereunder,  and will be impossible to accurately  measure.
Tenant therefore agrees that if possession of the Premises is not surrendered to
Landlord on or before the Expiration Date or sooner  termination of the Term, in
addition to any other rights or remedies  Landlord may have hereunder or at law,
Tenant shall (a) pay to Landlord for each month (or any portion  thereof) during
which  Tenant  holds over in the Premises  after the  Expiration  Date or sooner
termination  of the Term,  a sum equal to the  greater  of (i) one and  one-half
times the Fixed Rent plus one and one-half  times  Tenant's Tax Payment plus one
and one-half times Tenant's  Operating Payment payable under this Lease for each
day of the last full calendar month of the Term in the case of the first 30 days
of any holdover and two times the Fixed Rent plus two times Tenant's Tax Payment
plus two times Tenant's  Operating Payment payable under this Lease for each day
of the last full calendar  month of the Term in the case of each day  thereafter
or (ii) one and one-half  times the fair market rental value of the Premises for
such day (as reasonably determined by Landlord),  (b) after notice from Landlord
that  Landlord  has entered into an  occupancy  agreement  with a tenant for the
Premises  (or a portion  thereof) be liable to  Landlord  for (i) any payment or
rent concession

                                       56
<PAGE>

which  Landlord  may be required to make to any tenant  obtained by Landlord for
all or any part of the  Premises  (a "New  Tenant")  in order to induce such New
Tenant not to terminate its lease by reason of the  holding-over by Tenant,  and
(ii) the loss of the  benefit of the bargain if any New Tenant  shall  terminate
its lease by reason of the  holding-over by Tenant,  and (c) indemnify  Landlord
against all claims for damages by any New Tenant. No holding-over by Tenant, nor
the payment to Landlord of the amounts specified above,  shall operate to extend
the Term hereof.  Nothing herein  contained  shall be deemed to permit Tenant to
retain   possession  of  the  Premises  after  the  Expiration  Date  or  sooner
termination of this Lease, and no acceptance by Landlord of payments from Tenant
after the Expiration  Date or sooner  termination of the Term shall be deemed to
be other than on account of the amount to be paid by Tenant in  accordance  with
the  provisions  of this  Article  22. All of  Tenant's  obligations  under this
Article shall survive the expiration or earlier  termination of the Term of this
Lease.

     Section 22.3 Waiver of Stay.  Tenant expressly  waives,  for itself and for
any Person claiming through or under Tenant, any rights which Tenant or any such
Person  may have  under the  provisions  of  Section  2201 of the New York Civil
Practice Law and Rules and of any successor law of like import then in force, in
connection with any holdover summary proceedings which Landlord may institute to
enforce the foregoing provisions of this Article 22.


                                   ARTICLE 23

                                 QUIET ENJOYMENT

     Provided  this  Lease is in full  force and  effect and no Event of Default
then  exists,  Tenant may  peaceably  and  quietly  enjoy the  Premises  without
hindrance by Landlord or any person lawfully claiming through or under Landlord,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease and to all Superior Leases and
Mortgages.


                                   ARTICLE 24

                             NO SURRENDER; NO WAIVER

     Section 24.1 No  Surrender or Release.  No act or thing done by Landlord or
Landlord's  agents or employees during the Term shall be deemed an acceptance of
a surrender of the  Premises,  and no provision of this Lease shall be deemed to
have been waived by Landlord,  unless such waiver is in writing and is signed by
Landlord,  and any such waiver shall be effective only for the specific  purpose
and in the specific  instance in which  given.  If Tenant at any time desires to
have Landlord sublet the Premises for Tenant's  account,  Landlord or Landlord's
agents are authorized to receive  Tenant's keys to the Premises for such purpose
without  releasing  Tenant from any of the  obligations  under this

                                       57
<PAGE>

Lease,  and Tenant  hereby  relieves  Landlord of any  liability  for loss of or
damage to any of Tenant's effects in connection with such subletting.

     Section  24.2 No Waiver.  The failure of either  party to seek  redress for
violation  of, or to insist  upon the strict  performance  of, any  covenant  or
condition  of this  Lease,  or any of the  Rules and  Regulations,  shall not be
construed  as a waiver  or  relinquishment  of the  future  performance  of such
obligations  of this  Lease or the  Rules  and  Regulations,  or of the right to
exercise such election but the same shall  continue and remain in full force and
effect with respect to any subsequent  breach,  act or omission.  The receipt by
Landlord  of any Rent  payable  pursuant  to this  Lease or any other  sums with
knowledge  of the breach of any  covenant  of this  Lease  shall not be deemed a
waiver of such  breach.  No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser
amount than the monthly Fixed Rent or Additional Rent herein stipulated shall be
deemed to be other than a payment on account of the  earliest  stipulated  Fixed
Rent or Additional  Rent,  or as Landlord may elect to apply such  payment,  nor
shall any endorsement or acceptance of any check or other payment in the face of
a statement  on such check or any letter  accompanying  such check or payment be
deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment
without  prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance of such Fixed Rent
or  Additional  Rent or pursue any other  remedy  provided  in this  Lease.  The
existence of a right of renewal or  extension of this Lease,  or the exercise of
such  right,  shall  not  limit  Landlord's  right to  terminate  this  Lease in
accordance with the terms hereof.


                                   ARTICLE 25

                             WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY

     LANDLORD AND TENANT HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY AGAINST THE OTHER ON ANY MATTERS IN ANY WAY
ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH THIS LEASE,  THE  RELATIONSHIP  OF LANDLORD AND
TENANT,  TENANT'S USE OR OCCUPANCY OF THE PREMISES,  OR THE  ENFORCEMENT  OF ANY
REMEDY  UNDER ANY  REQUIREMENT.  If Landlord  commences  any summary  proceeding
against  Tenant,  Tenant will not  interpose any  counterclaim  of any nature or
description in any such proceeding  (unless failure to impose such  counterclaim
would preclude Tenant from asserting in a separate action the claim which is the
subject of such counterclaim),  and will not seek to consolidate such proceeding
with any other  action which may have been or will be brought in any other court
by Tenant.

     This Lease and the  obligation  of Tenant to pay Rent and to perform all of
the other  covenants and agreements of Tenant  hereunder  shall not be affected,
impaired or excused by any  Unavoidable  Delays.  Landlord  shall use reasonable
efforts to  promptly  notify  Tenant of any  Unavoidable  Delay  which  prevents
Landlord from fulfilling any of its obligations under this Lease.

     Tenant and all Tenant  Parties  shall observe and comply with the Rules and

case of any conflict or  inconsistency  between the provisions of this Lease and
any of the Rules and Regulations as originally promulgated or as supplemented or
amended from time to time, the provisions of this Lease shall control.  Landlord
reserves the right, from time to time, to adopt additional  reasonable Rules and
Regulations and to reasonably  amend the Rules and  Regulations  then in effect.
Nothing  contained in this Lease shall impose upon  Landlord any  obligation  to
enforce the Rules and Regulations or terms, covenants or conditions in any other
lease against any other  Building  tenant,  and Landlord  shall not be liable to
Tenant for  violation  of the Rules and  Regulations  by any other  tenant,  its

                               PARTNERSHIP TENANT

     Section 29.1 Partnership Tenant. If Tenant, or a permitted assignee of this
Lease pursuant to Article 15 hereof, is a partnership, or is comprised of two or
more Persons, individually or as partners of a partnership (any such partnership
and such Persons are referred to in this Article as "Partnership  Tenant"),  the
following  shall  apply:  (a) the  liability  of each  of the  general  partners
(excluding  Persons solely holding interests as limited  partners),  each of the
partners in a limited liability  partnership or Persons  comprising  Partnership
Tenant (the  "Partners")  shall be joint and  several;  (b) each of the Partners
hereby consents in advance to, and agrees to be bound by, any written instrument
which may  hereafter be executed by  Partnership  Tenant or any of the Partners,
which shall  modify,  extend or discharge  this Lease,  in whole or in part,  or
surrender  all  or  any  part  of the  Premises  to  Landlord;  (c)  any  bills,
statements, notices, demands, requests or other communications given or rendered
to  Partnership  Tenant  or to  any  of  the  Partners  shall  be  binding  upon
Partnership  Tenant and all of the  Partners;  (d) if  Partnership  Tenant shall
admit new Partners,  all new Partners  shall,  by their admission to Partnership
Tenant,  be  deemed  to  have  assumed  joint  and  several  liability  for  the
performance  of all of the  terms,  covenants  and  conditions  of this Lease on
Tenant's part to be observed and performed;  (e)  Partnership  Tenant shall give
prompt notice to Landlord of the admission of any new Partners,  and upon

                                       60
<PAGE>

demand of Landlord,  shall cause each such new partner to execute and deliver to
Landlord an agreement in form and substance  satisfactory  to Landlord,  wherein
each new Partner shall assume joint and several liability for the performance of
all the terms,  covenants  and  conditions  of this Lease on Tenant's part to be
observed  and  performed  (but  neither  Landlord's  failure to request any such
agreement  nor the  failure of any new  Partner  to execute or deliver  any such
agreement to Landlord shall vitiate the provisions of this Section 29.1(e)); and
(f) no change in the Partners of Partnership Tenant resulting from the admission
of a new Partner,  or the death,  retirement  or  withdrawal  of a Partner shall
release  Partnership  Tenant  or  any  Partner  or  former  Partner  from  their
obligations under this Lease.

     Section 29.2 Change of Partners. If Tenant is a Partnership Tenant, (a) the
admission of new Partners,  the withdrawal (in the ordinary course of business),
retirement,   death,   incompetency  or  bankruptcy  of  any  Partner,   or  the
reallocation  of partnership  interests  among the Partners shall  constitute an
assignment of this Lease unless Partners  holding in the aggregate not less than
80% of the partnership interests in Partnership Tenant immediately prior to such
event remain as Partners holding not less than 80% of the partnership  interests
in  Partnership  Tenant during the 12-month  period  immediately  following such
event (i.e.,  the transfer,  by any of the foregoing  means, of more than 20% of
the  partnership  interests in Partnership  Tenant in any  consecutive  12-month
period shall constitute an assignment of this Lease subject to the provisions of
Article  15),  and  (b)  the   reorganization  of  Partnership   Tenant  into  a
professional   corporation   or  a  limited   liability   partnership,   or  the
reorganization of Tenant from a professional  corporation or a limited liability
partnership  into a  partnership,  shall  constitute an assignment of this Lease
unless immediately  following such  reorganization the Partners or shareholders,
as the case may be, of Tenant  shall be the same as those  existing  immediately
prior to such reorganization,  and shall acknowledge in writing to Landlord that
they remain fully liable, jointly and severally, under this Lease as provided in
this  Article  29. If  Tenant  shall  become a  professional  corporation,  each
individual shareholder, shareholder-employee, new individual shareholder and new
shareholder-employee  of any professional  corporation which is a shareholder in
Tenant shall have the same  personal  liability  (if any) as such  individual or
shareholder-employee  would have under this Lease if Tenant  were a  partnership
and such individual or shareholder-employee  were a Partner or admitted as a new
Partner.   If   any   individual   Partner   in   Tenant   is   or   becomes   a
shareholder-employee of a professional  corporation,  such individual shall have
the same personal liability under this Lease as such individual would have if he
and not the professional  corporation were a Partner of Tenant.  If Tenant shall
become a limited liability partnership,  (i) each Partner therein shall continue
to have the same  personal  liability as such Partner had under this Lease prior
to Tenant becoming a limited  liability  partnership,  and (ii) each new partner
admitted to such limited liability  partnership shall be bound by the provisions
of Section  29.1,  and shall  execute  and deliver to  Landlord  the  assumption
agreement required pursuant to Section 29.1(e) hereof.

     Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in this  Lease  or  indicated  on any
sketch,  blueprint or plan,  no vaults,  vault space or other space  outside the
boundaries of the Real Property are included in the Premises.  Landlord makes no
representation  as to the location of the boundaries of the Real  Property.  All
vaults and vault space and all other space  outside the  boundaries  of the Real
Property  which  Tenant  may be  permitted  to use or  occupy  are to be used or
occupied under a revocable license.  If any such license shall be revoked, or if
the amount of such space shall be  diminished  as  required by any  Governmental
Authority or by any public  utility  company,  such  revocation,  diminution  or
requisition  shall not (i)  constitute an actual or  constructive  eviction,  in
whole or in part,  (ii) entitle  Tenant to any  abatement or diminution of Rent,
(iii)  relieve  Tenant from any of its  obligations  under this  Lease,  or (iv)
impose  any  liability  upon  Landlord.  Any fee,  tax or charge  imposed by any
Governmental  Authority for any such vaults, vault space or other space occupied
by Tenant shall be paid by Tenant.

     Section 31.1 Broker Representations. Landlord has retained Landlord's Agent
as leasing  agent in  connection  with this Lease and  Landlord  shall be solely
responsible  for any fee that may be payable to Landlord's  Agent and the Broker
pursuant to separate  agreements.  Each of Landlord  and Tenant  represents  and
warrants to the other that it has not dealt with any broker in  connection  with
this Lease  other than  Landlord's  Agent and the Broker and that to the best of
its knowledge and belief,  no other  broker,  finder or like entity  procured or
negotiated  this Lease or is entitled  to any fee or  commission  in  connection
herewith.  The  execution  and  delivery  of this Lease by each  party  shall be
conclusive   evidence   that  each   party  has   relied   upon  the   foregoing
representations and warranties.

     Section  31.2  Indemnity.  Each of  Landlord  and Tenant  shall  indemnify,
defend,  protect and hold the other party  harmless from and against any and all
Losses  which  the  indemnified  party  may  incur by  reason of any claim of or
liability to any broker,  finder or like agent (other than Landlord's  Agent and
the Broker with respect to Tenant's  indemnity  to Landlord)  arising out of any
dealings  claimed  to have  occurred  between  the  indemnifying  party  and the
claimant in connection with this Lease,  and/or the above  representation  being
false. The provisions of this Article 31 shall survive the expiration or earlier
termination of the Term of this Lease.

                                    INDEMNITY

     Section  32.1 (a) Tenant's  Indemnity.  Tenant shall not do or permit to be
done any act or thing  upon the  Premises  or the  Building  which  may  subject
Landlord to any liability or  responsibility  for injury,  damages to persons or
property  or to  any  liability  by  reason  of any  violation  of law or of any
Requirement,  and shall  exercise  such  control  over the  Premises as to fully
protect the Indemnitees against any such liability. Subject to the provisions of
Section 12.2, Tenant shall indemnify,  defend, protect and hold harmless each of
the  Indemnitees  from and against any and all Losses (as defined in  subsection
(b) hereof),  resulting from any claims (i) against Indemnitees arising from any
act,  omission or negligence of any Tenant Party, (ii) except to the extent such
Losses arise out of the gross  negligence  or willful  misconduct of Landlord or
its agents,  employees or contractors,  against the Indemnitees arising from any
accident, injury or damage whatsoever caused to any person or to the property of
any person and  occurring  during the Term or during the period of time, if any,
prior to the  commencement  or  following  the  expiration  of the Term that any
Tenant  Party may have been given  access to any portion of the Premises for the
purpose of  performing  work or otherwise,  in or about the Premises,  and (iii)
against the Indemnitees  resulting from any breach,  violation or nonperformance
of any  covenant,  condition or agreement of this Lease on the part of Tenant to
be fulfilled, kept, observed and performed.

                  (b)  Indemnity  Inclusions.  As used in this  Lease,  the term
"Losses"  means any and all losses,  liabilities,  damages,  claims,  judgments,
fines,  suits,  demands,  costs,  interest  and  expenses  of any kind or nature
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements)  incurred in connection
with any claim,  proceeding or judgment and the defense  thereof,  and including
all  costs of  repairing  any  damage to the  Premises  or the  Building  or the
appurtenances  of any of the foregoing to which a particular  indemnity and hold
harmless agreement applies.

                  (c) Landlord's Indemnity. Subject to the provisions of Section
12.2, Landlord shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tenant from and against
all  Losses  incurred  by Tenant  arising  from any  accident,  injury or damage
whatsoever  caused to any person or the  property  of any person in or about the
common or public areas of the Building (specifically  excluding the Premises) to
the  extent  attributable  to the gross  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  of
Landlord or its agents, employees or contractors.

     Section 32.2 Defense and Settlement.  If any claim, action or proceeding is
made or  brought  against  any  indemnified  party,  then,  upon  demand  by the
indemnified party, the indemnifying  party, at its sole cost and expense,  shall
resist or defend such claim,  action or  proceeding in the  indemnified  party's
name (if  necessary)  by  attorneys  approved by the  indemnified  party,  which
approval  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld.  Attorneys for Tenant's  insurer
shall  hereby  be  deemed   approved   for   purposes  of  this  Section   32.2.

attorneys to participate or assist in defending any claim,  action or proceeding
involving  potential  liability  of  $10,000,000  or  more,  provided  that  the
indemnifying  party shall control the defense and the  indemnifying  party shall
pay the reasonable fees and  disbursements  of such  attorneys.  Notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary, the indemnifying party may direct the
indemnified  party to settle any claim,  suit or other proceeding  provided that
(a) such  settlement  shall involve no obligation on the part of the indemnified
party other than the payment of money,  (b) any payments to be made  pursuant to
such settlement shall be paid in full  exclusively by the indemnifying  party at
the time such settlement is reached,  (c) such settlement  shall not require the
indemnified  party to admit any liability,  and (d) the indemnified  party shall
have  received an  unconditional  release from the other  parties to such claim,
suit or other  proceeding.  The  provisions of this Article 32 shall survive the
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

person causing or authorized to cause such excavation  license to enter upon the
Premises for the purpose of doing such work as such person shall deem  necessary
to preserve  the wall of the  Building  from injury or damage and to support the
same by proper foundations.  In connection with such license,  Tenant shall have
no right to claim any damages or indemnity  against  Landlord,  or diminution or
abatement of Rent,  provided  that Tenant  shall  continue to have access to the
Premises.

     Tenant recognizes and acknowledges that Landlord and/or certain  beneficial
owners of  Landlord  may from time to time  qualify  as real  estate  investment
trusts pursuant to Sections 856 et seq. of the Code or as entities  described in
Section  511(a)(2) of the Code,  and that  avoiding (a) the loss of such status,
(b) the receipt of any income  derived  under any  provision  of this Lease that
does not  constitute  "rents  from real  property"  (in the case of real  estate
investment trusts) or that constitutes  "unrelated  business taxable income" (in
the case of entities  described in Section  511(a)(2) of the Code),  and (c) the
imposition of penalty or similar taxes (each an "Adverse  Event") is of material
concern to Landlord and such  beneficial  owners and Tenant's  agreement  herein
contained  regarding the avoidance of an Adverse Event as a material  inducement
to  Landlord  entering  into this  Lease.  In the event

that this Lease or any document  contemplated  hereby  could,  in the opinion of
counsel to  Landlord,  result in or cause an  Adverse  Event,  Tenant  agrees to
reasonably  cooperate  with Landlord in amending or modifying this Lease or such
documents  and shall at the request of Landlord,  and at  Landlord's  reasonable
expense,  execute and deliver such documents  reasonably required to effect such
amendment  or  modification.  Any  amendment  or  modification  pursuant to this
Article 34 shall be  structured  so that the  economic  results to Landlord  and
Tenant shall be  substantially  similar to those set forth in this Lease without
regard  to such  amendment  or  modification  and shall  not  increase  Tenant's
monetary  obligations  hereunder at all or,  other than to a de minimis  extent,
increase Tenant's other obligations  hereunder or adversely affect the rights of
Tenant  hereunder.  Without  limiting any of Landlord's  other rights under this
Article 34,  Landlord  may waive the  receipt of any amount  payable to Landlord
hereunder and such waiver shall  constitute an amendment or modification of this
Lease with respect to such payment.

                                SECURITY DEPOSIT

     Section 35.1 Security  Deposit.  Tenant shall deposit the Security  Deposit
with  Landlord  upon the  execution  of this Lease in cash as  security  for the
faithful  performance  and  observance  by Tenant of the  terms,  covenants  and
conditions of this Lease,  including the surrender of possession of the Premises
to Landlord as herein provided.

     Section  35.2  Letter of  Credit.  In lieu of a cash  deposit,  Tenant  may
deliver the  Security  Deposit to Landlord in the form of a clean,  irrevocable,
non-documentary and unconditional letter of credit in the amount of the Security
Deposit (the  "Letter of Credit")  issued by and  drawable  upon any  commercial
bank,  trust  company,   national  banking   association  or  savings  and  loan
association  with  offices  for  banking  purposes  in the City of New York (the
"Issuing  Bank"),  which has outstanding  unsecured,  uninsured and unguaranteed
indebtedness,  or shall have issued a letter of credit or other credit  facility
that constitutes the primary security for any outstanding indebtedness (which is
otherwise  uninsured and  unguaranteed),  that is then rated,  without regard to
qualification  of  such  rating  by  symbols  such  as "+"  or "-" or  numerical
notation,  "Aa" or better by  Moody's  Investors  Service  and "AA" or better by
Standard  &  Poor's  Rating  Service,  and has  combined  capital,  surplus  and

shall be so imposed, then such fees or charges shall be payable solely by Tenant
and the Letter of Credit shall so specify.  The Letter of Credit  shall  provide
that  it  shall  be  deemed  automatically  renewed,   without  amendment,   for
consecutive periods of one year

                                       65

each thereafter  during the Term through the date that is at least 60 days after
the Expiration  Date,  unless the Issuing Bank sends a notice (the  "Non-Renewal
Notice") to Landlord by certified mail, return receipt requested,  not less than
45 days next preceding the then  expiration date of the Letter of Credit stating
that the Issuing  Bank has  elected not to renew the Letter of Credit.  Landlord
shall have the right,  upon receipt of the Non-Renewal  Notice, to draw the full
amount of the Letter of Credit,  by sight draft on the Issuing  Bank,  and shall
thereafter  hold or apply the cash proceeds of the Letter of Credit  pursuant to
the terms of this  Article.  The Letter of Credit  shall state that drafts drawn
under  and in  compliance  with the terms of the  Letter of Credit  will be duly
honored upon  presentation  to the Issuing Bank at an office in  Manhattan.  The
Letter of Credit  shall be subject in all  respects to the  Uniform  Customs and
Practice for  Documentary  Credits  (1993  revision),  International  Chamber of
Commerce Publication No. 500.

     Section 35.3  Application  of Security.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default, Landlord may apply or retain the whole or any part of the cash Security
Deposit or may notify the Issuing Bank and thereupon receive all or a portion of
the Security  Deposit  represented  by the Letter of Credit and use,  apply,  or
retain the whole or any part of such proceeds, as the case may be, to the extent
required  for the payment of any Fixed Rent or any other sum as to which  Tenant
is in default including (a) any sum which Landlord may expend or may be required
to expend by reason of Tenant's default, and/or (b) any damages or Deficiency to
which  Landlord is entitled  pursuant to this Lease or applicable  Requirements,
whether such damages or Deficiency  accrues before or after summary  proceedings
or other  reentry by  Landlord.  If Landlord  applies or retains any part of the
Security Deposit, Tenant, upon demand, shall deposit with Landlord the amount so
applied or retained so that  Landlord  shall have the full  Security  Deposit on
hand at all times during the Term. If Tenant shall fully and  faithfully  comply
with all of the terms,  covenants  and  conditions  of this Lease,  the Security
Deposit (or so much  thereof as remains)  shall be returned to Tenant  after the
Expiration  Date and after delivery of possession of the Premises to Landlord in
the manner  required by this Lease.  Tenant  expressly  agrees that Tenant shall
have no right to apply  any  portion  of the  Security  Deposit  against  any of
Tenant's obligations to pay Rent hereunder.

     Section 35.4 Transfer.  Upon a sale of the Real Property or the Building or
a leasing of the  Building,  or any financing of  Landlord's  interest  therein,
Landlord  shall  have the right to  transfer  the cash  Security  Deposit or the
Letter of Credit, as applicable,  to the vendee,  lessee or lender. With respect
to the Letter of Credit,  within five days after notice of such sale, leasing or
financing,  Tenant,  at its sole cost,  shall  arrange  for the  transfer of the
Letter of Credit to the new landlord or the lender, as designated by Landlord in
the  foregoing  notice or have the Letter of Credit  reissued in the name of the
new  landlord or the  lender.  Tenant  shall look solely to the new  landlord or
lender for the return of such cash Security  Deposit or Letter of Credit and the
provisions  hereof  shall  apply to every  transfer  or  assignment  made of the
Security  Deposit to a new  landlord.  Tenant  shall not assign or  encumber  or
attempt to assign or encumber the cash Security  Deposit or Letter of Credit and
neither Landlord nor its

                                       66

successors or assigns shall be bound by any such action or attempted assignment,
or encumbrance.

conveyance, assignment or transfer or lease of Landlord's interest (collectively
a "Transfer") by Landlord (or upon any subsequent landlord after the Transfer by
such subsequent  landlord) of its interest in the Building or the Real Property,
as the case may be,  and in the event of any such  Transfer,  Landlord  (and any
such subsequent  landlord) shall be entirely freed and relieved of all covenants
and obligations of Landlord hereunder, and the transferee of Landlord's interest
(or that of such subsequent  landlord) in the Building or the Real Property,  as
the case may be, shall,  except as otherwise  provided  below, be deemed to have
assumed all obligations under this Lease.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  such
transferee  may elect not to, or fail to, assume  Landlord's  obligations  under
this  Lease  arising  prior to the  transfer,  in which  event the  transferring
Landlord  shall  remain  liable  for  covenants,  and  obligations  of  Landlord
hereunder arising prior to such sale,  conveyance,  assignment or transfer while
such transferring  Landlord owned the Building or the Real Property, as the case
may be, but only to the extent of the net undistributed proceeds from such sale,
conveyance, assignment or transfer.

     Section  36.3  Limitation  on  Liability.  The  liability  of Landlord  for
Landlord's  obligations under this Lease shall be limited to Landlord's interest
from time to time in the Real Property (and the net unapplied and  undistributed
sales, condemnation and insurance proceeds thereof) and Tenant shall not look to
any other  property  or  assets of  Landlord  or the  property  or assets of any
Indemnitees in seeking either to enforce Landlord's obligations under this Lease
or to satisfy a judgment for Landlord's failure to perform such obligations; and
none of the  Indemnitees  shall be  personally  liable  for the  performance  of
Landlord's obligations under this Lease.

     Section 36.4 Rent.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in
this Lease, all amounts payable by Tenant to or on behalf of Landlord under this
Lease,  whether or not expressly  denominated Fixed Rent,  Tenant's Tax Payment,

thereby  affected,  and each provision hereof shall remain valid and enforceable
to the fullest extent permitted by law.

     Section 36.8 Consent to Jurisdiction.  (a) Except as expressly  provided to
the contrary in this Lease, Tenant agrees that all disputes arising, directly or
indirectly,  out of or relating to this Lease,  and all actions to enforce  this
Lease,  shall be dealt with and  adjudicated in the state courts of the State of
New York or the federal  courts for the Southern  District of New York;  and for
that purpose Tenant expressly and irrevocably submits itself to the jurisdiction
of such courts.  Tenant agrees that so far as is permitted under applicable law,
this consent to personal  jurisdiction  shall be  self-operative  and no further
instrument  or  action,  other than  service  of  process in one of the  manners
specified in this Lease, or as otherwise permitted by law, shall be necessary in
order to confer  jurisdiction  upon it in any such court.  Tenant further agrees
that judgment  against it in any such action or  proceeding  shall be conclusive
and, to the extent  permitted  by  applicable  law, may be enforced in any other
jurisdiction  within or  outside  the  United  States of  America by suit on the
judgment,  a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence
of the fact and of the amount of its indebtedness.

                  (b) To the extent that Tenant has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity  from  jurisdiction  of any  court or from any legal  process  (whether
through service or notice,  attachment  prior to judgment,  attachment in aid of
execution,  execution  or  otherwise)  with  respect to itself or its  property,
Tenant irrevocably waives such immunity in respect of its obligations under this
Lease.

provided,  however,  that (a) no Event of  Default  shall have  occurred  and be
continuing either on the date the Renewal Notice is given or on the Renewal Term
Commencement Date (as hereinafter defined), and (b) Tenant shall be in occupancy
of at least 80% of the  rentable  area of the  Premises.  Upon the giving of the
Renewal Notice, this Lease shall be deemed renewed for the Renewal Term with the
same force and effect as if the Renewal Term had originally been included in the
Term. The Renewal Term shall commence on the day after the Expiration  Date (the
"Renewal Term  Commencement  Date") and shall terminate on the day preceding the
5th  anniversary of the Renewal Term  Commencement  Date or such earlier date as
this Lease shall terminate pursuant to any of the terms of this Lease.

     Section 37.2 Terms.  All of the terms,  covenants  and  conditions  of this
Lease shall  continue in full force and effect during the Renewal  Term,  except
that (a) the Fixed Rent for the Renewal  Term shall be in an amount equal to the
greater of (i) 100% of the Fair Market Value (as  hereinafter  defined) and (ii)
the annual Fixed Rent,  Tenant's Tax Payment and Tenant's Operating Payment then
in effect at the expiration of the initial term of this Lease,  (b) Tenant shall
have no further right to renew the Term,  (c) the Base Tax Year shall be the Tax

be  the  Operating   Expenses  for  such  Comparison   Year.  Any   termination,
cancellation  or surrender of the entire  interest of Tenant under this Lease at
any time  during  the Term  shall  terminate  any  right of  renewal  of  Tenant
hereunder.

     Section 37.3 Fair Market  Value.  "Fair  Market  Value" shall mean the fair
market  annual rental value of the Premises at the  commencement  of the Renewal
Term for a term equal to the Renewal Term,  as  determined by Landlord  based on
comparable space in the Building,  including all of Landlord's services provided
for in this Lease,  and with (a) the Premises  considered as vacant,  and in the
"as is" condition  existing on the Renewal Term Commencement  Date, (b) the Base
Tax Year being the Tax Year commencing on the July 1st prior to the Renewal Term
Commencement  Date,  (c) the  Base  Expense  Years  being  the  Comparison  Year
commencing  on the January 1st prior to the Renewal Term  Commencement  Date and
(d) the Base Operating Expenses being the Operating Expenses for such Comparison
Year.  The  calculation of Fair Market Value shall also be adjusted to take into
account all relevant  factors.  Prior to the  commencement  of the Renewal Term,
Landlord shall deliver to Tenant Landlord's determination of Fair Market Value.

     Section 37.4 Arbitration.  If Tenant shall dispute Landlord's determination
of Fair Market  Value , Tenant  shall give  notice to  Landlord of such  dispute
within 30 days after the delivery of  Landlord's  determination  to Tenant,  and
such dispute shall be determined by a single arbitrator  appointed in accordance
with the American  Arbitration  Association  Real Estate  Valuation  Arbitration
Proceeding  Rules. If no notice of dispute is given by Tenant within such 30-day
period  (time being of the  essence),  then  Landlord's  determination  shall be
binding upon Tenant.  The arbitrator  shall be impartial and shall have not less
than 10 years'  experience  in the County of New York  related to the leasing of
commercial office space in office buildings comparable to the Building,  and the
fees of the  arbitrator  shall be shared by Landlord and Tenant.  Within 15 days
following the appointment of the arbitrator,  Landlord and Tenant shall attend a
hearing  before the arbitrator at which each party shall submit a report setting
forth its determination of Fair Market Value,  together with such information on
comparable  rentals and such other  evidence as such party shall deem  relevant.
The  arbitrator  shall,  within 30 days following such hearing and submission of
evidence,  render his or her decision by  selecting  the  determination  of Fair
Market Value  submitted by either  Landlord or Tenant which,  in the judgment of
the arbitrator, most nearly reflects the Fair Market Value. The arbitrator shall
have no power or  authority  to select any Fair  Market  Value other than a Fair
Market Value  submitted by Landlord or Tenant or to modify any of the provisions
of this Lease,  and the  decision of the  arbitrator  shall be final and binding
upon Landlord and Tenant.  Prior to the determination of the arbitrator,  Tenant
shall pay Fixed Rent based on  Landlord's  determination  of Fair  Market  Value
submitted to Tenant  pursuant to Section 37.3,  and  following the  arbitrator's
final  determination,  the amount of any  overpayment or  underpayment  shall be
appropriately adjusted between the parties.

     Section 37.5  Agreement of Terms.  Landlord and Tenant,  at either  party's
request, shall promptly execute and exchange an appropriate agreement evidencing
the extension of

                                       72
<PAGE>

the Term for the  Renewal  Term,  and the  terms  thereof  in a form  reasonably
satisfactory to both parties,  but no such agreement shall be necessary in order
to make the provisions hereof effective.


                                   ARTICLE 38

                              RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER

     Section 38.1 Exercise of Right.  If at any time prior to the last 24 months
of the Term (as the same may be  extended)  all or any  portion of the  rentable
area of the 31st floor of the  Building  that is not subject to this Lease (each
such  space  being  hereinafter  referred  to as an  "Expansion  Space")  is, or
Landlord  reasonably  believes the same is to become,  Available (as hereinafter
defined) and Landlord  proposes to lease such  Expansion  Space,  Landlord shall
deliver  notice  thereof  to Tenant  (an  "Expansion  Notice")  setting  forth a
description of the Expansion  Space in question,  the rentable square footage of
such  Expansion  Space,  Landlord's  determination  of the Expansion  Space Fair
Market  Value (as  hereinafter  defined) for such  Expansion  Space and the date
Landlord reasonably  anticipates that such Expansion Space will become Available
(the "Anticipated Expansion Space Commencement Date").  Provided that all of the
conditions precedent set forth in this Article 38 are fully satisfied by Tenant,
Tenant  shall have the option (an  "Expansion  Option"),  exercisable  by Tenant
delivering irrevocable notice to Landlord (an "Acceptance Notice") within 7 days
of the giving by Landlord of the applicable  Expansion Notice, time being of the
essence,  to lease the Expansion Space described in the related Expansion Notice
upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Article 38. An Expansion  Option
may be  exercised  only with respect to all of the  Expansion  Space that is the
subject of an  applicable  Expansion  Notice.  If Tenant fails to timely give an
Acceptance Notice with respect to any Expansion Space, Tenant shall be deemed to
have  rejected  Landlord's  offer to lease the  applicable  Expansion  Space and
Landlord  shall have no  further  obligation  and  Tenant  shall have no further
rights with respect to that particular Expansion Space during the Term.

     Section 38.2  Definitions.  (a) "Available"  shall mean that at the time in
question  (i) no Person  leases or  occupies  the  Expansion  Space  that is the
subject of an Expansion Notice,  whether pursuant to a lease or other agreement,
and (ii) no Person  holds any option or right to lease or occupy such  Expansion
Space, or to renew its lease or right of occupancy thereof.  So long as a tenant
or other  occupant  leases or  occupies  a portion of the  applicable  Expansion
Space,  Landlord shall be free to extend any such tenancy or occupancy,  whether
or not  pursuant  to a lease or other  agreement,  and such  space  shall not be
deemed to be Available.  In no event shall  Landlord be liable to Tenant for any
failure by any then  existing  tenant or occupant to vacate any of the Expansion
Space.  From and after the date hereof,  Landlord  shall not grant any rights to
any tenant or other occupant of the Building with respect to any Expansion Space
unless such  rights are  subordinate  to the rights  granted  Tenant  hereunder,

                                       73
<PAGE>

except to new tenants or  occupants  of a portion of the  Expansion  Space after
Landlord  shall have duly offered such portion of the Expansion  Space to Tenant
pursuant to this Article 38.

                  (b) "Expansion  Space Fair Market Value," with respect to each
Expansion  Space,  shall  mean  the  fair  market  annual  rental  value of such
Expansion Space at the commencement of the leasing of such Expansion Space for a
term  commencing  on  the  applicable  Expansion  Space  Commencement  Date  (as
hereinafter  defined)  and  ending on the  Expiration  Date,  as  determined  by
Landlord based on comparable space in the Building,  including all of Landlord's
services  provided for in the Lease and with (i) such Expansion Space considered
as vacant and in the "as is" condition  which same shall be in on the applicable
Expansion  Space  Commencement  Date,  (ii) the Base Tax Year being the Tax Year
commencing on the July 1st immediately  preceding the applicable Expansion Space
Commencement  Date,  (iii) the Base  Expense  Years  being the  Comparison  Year
commencing on the January 1st  immediately  preceding the  applicable  Expansion
Space  Commencement  Date,  and (iv)  the  Base  Operating  Expenses  bring  the
Operating  Expenses for such Comparison Year. The calculation of Expansion Space
Fair Market Value shall also be adjusted to take into account any other relevant
factors.

     Section 38.3 Conditions to Exercise. Tenant shall have no right to exercise
an Expansion  Option unless all of the following  conditions have been satisfied
on the date the applicable Acceptance Notice is delivered to Landlord and on the
Expansion Space Commencement Date:

          (a) No Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

          (b) Tenant shall be in  occupancy of 100% of the rentable  area of the
     Premises; and

          (c) There shall not have occurred any material  adverse  change in the
     financial condition of Tenant from the condition described on the financial
     statements submitted by Tenant to Landlord in connection with this Lease.

     Section 38.4 Incorporation of Expansion Space.  Effective as of the date on
which Landlord  delivers vacant possession of an Expansion Space to Tenant (with
respect to each such Expansion Space, the "Expansion Space Commencement Date"):

          (a) Fixed Rent for such Expansion  Space shall be the Expansion  Space
     Fair Market Value as determined in accordance with this Article 38.

          (b) Tenant  shall pay  Tenant's  Tax  Payment and  Tenant's  Operating
     Payment  with  respect  to such  Expansion  Space  in  accordance  with the
     provisions of Article 8, except that (i) the Base Tax Year shall be the Tax
     Year  commencing  on the  July 1st  immediately  preceding  the  applicable
     Expansion Space Commencement Date, (ii) the Base

                                       74
<PAGE>

     Expense Years shall be the  Comparison  Year  commencing on the January 1st
     immediately preceding the applicable Expansion Space Commencement Date, and
     (iii) the Base Operating  Expenses shall be the Operating Expenses for such
     Comparison Year.

          (c) The rentable square footage of the Expansion Space shall be as set
     forth in the applicable  Expansion Notice (which the parties agree shall be
     the rentable  square  footage of such  Expansion  Space for all purposes of
     this  Lease),  the  Agreed  Area of  Premises  shall be  increased  by such
     rentable  square  footage  and  Tenant's   Proportionate   Share  shall  be
     appropriately adjusted.

          (d) The applicable  Expansion  Space shall be delivered in its "as is"
     condition,  and  Landlord  shall not be  obligated to perform any work with
     respect  thereto  or make  any  contribution  to  Tenant  to  prepare  such
     Expansion Space for Tenant's occupancy;

          (e) The Security  Deposit shall be increased by an amount equal to (i)
     the then existing amount of the Security Deposit then required  pursuant to
     Article 35, divided by the number of rentable square feet then contained in
     the  Premises,  multiplied  by (ii) the  number  of  rentable  square  feet
     contained in such Expansion Space; and

          (f) The applicable  Expansion Space shall be added to and be deemed to
     be a part  of the  Premises  for all  purposes  of this  Lease  (except  as
     otherwise provided in this Section 38).

     Section 38.5  Possession.  In no event shall Landlord be obligated to incur
any fee,  cost,  expense or  obligation,  nor to  prosecute  any legal action or
proceeding, in connection with the delivery of any Expansion Space to Tenant nor
shall Tenant's obligations under this Lease with respect to the Premises or such
Expansion  Space be  affected  thereby.  Landlord  shall not be  subject  to any
liability  and this Lease shall not be  impaired if Landlord  shall be unable to
deliver  possession of any  Expansion  Space to Tenant on any  particular  date.
Tenant  hereby waives any right to rescind this Lease or any  Acceptance  Notice
under the  provisions  of Section 223-a of the Real Property Law of the State of
New York,  and agrees that the  provisions  of this Section 38.5 are intended to
constitute  "an express  provision to the  contrary"  within the meaning of said
Section  223-a.  Landlord  agrees that it shall not waive any rights it may have
against any Person holding over in the Expansion  Space,  without any obligation
to enforce any such rights.

     Section 38.6 Arbitration.  If Tenant shall dispute Landlord's determination
of the Expansion Space Fair Market Value for any Expansion  Space,  Tenant shall
give notice to Landlord of such dispute within 20 days following the delivery of
Landlord's  determination  to Tenant,  and such dispute shall be determined by a
single  arbitrator   appointed  in  accordance  with  the  American  Arbitration
Association Real Estate Valuation Arbitration  Proceeding Rules. If no notice of
any dispute is given within such 20 day period (time being of the essence), then
Landlord's  determination  shall be binding upon Tenant. The arbitrator

                                       75
<PAGE>

shall be  impartial  and shall  have not less than 10 years'  experience  in the
County of New York in a calling  related  to the  leasing of  commercial  office

appointment of the arbitrator, Landlord and Tenant shall attend a hearing before

determination  of the  Expansion  Space  Fair  Market  Value  of the  applicable
Expansion Space,  together with such information on comparable  rentals and such
other evidence as such party shall deem relevant.  The arbitrator shall,  within
30 days  following  such hearing and  submission of evidence,  render his or her
decision by selecting the determination of the Expansion Space Fair Market Value
submitted by either Landlord or Tenant which, in the judgment of the arbitrator,
most nearly  reflects the  Expansion  Space Fair Market Value of the  applicable
Expansion  Space.  The arbitrator shall have no power or authority to select any
Expansion  Space Fair  Market  Value other than an  Expansion  Space Fair Market
Value  submitted  by  Landlord  or  Tenant  or to  modify  any of the  terms and
provisions of this Lease,  and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and
binding upon Landlord and Tenant.  Prior to the determination of the arbitrator,
Tenant shall pay Fixed Rent based on Landlord's  determination  of the Expansion

arbitrator's final determination,  the amount of any overpayment or underpayment
shall be adjusted between the parties.

     Section 38.7  Agreement of Terms.  Landlord and Tenant,  at either  party's
request, shall promptly execute and exchange an appropriate agreement evidencing
the leasing of each Expansion  Space and the terms thereof in a form  reasonably
satisfactory to both parties,  but no such agreement shall be necessary in order
to make the provisions hereof effective.

                                   ARBITRATION

     In any arbitration which, pursuant to the express provisions of this Lease,
is  governed  by this  Article  39,  either  party may  submit the  dispute  for
resolution  by  arbitration  in the  City of New  York in  accordance  with  the
Commercial  Arbitration Rules (Expedited Procedures) of the American Arbitration
Association  ("AAA"),  except that the terms of this Article 39 shall  supersede
any  conflicting  or  otherwise  inconsistent  rules.  Provided  the  rules  and
regulations  of the AAA so  permit,  (i) the AAA shall,  within 2 Business  Days
after such submission or application, select a single arbitrator having at least
ten (10) years'  experience in leasing and  management of commercial  properties
similar to the Building,  (ii) the  arbitration  shall  commence 2 Business Days
thereafter  and  shall  be  limited  to a total  of  seven  hours on the date of
commencement  until  completion,  with each party having no more than a total of
two  hours to  present  its case and to  cross-examine  or  interrogate  persons
supplying  information or  documentation on behalf of the other party, and (iii)
the  arbitrator  shall make a  determination  within 3  Business  Days after the
conclusion  of  the  presentation  of  Landlord's

                                       76
<PAGE>

and Tenant's cases, which  determination shall be limited to a decision upon (A)
whether Landlord acted reasonably in withholding its consent or approval, or (B)
the  specific  dispute  presented  to the  arbitrator,  as  applicable  (and the
arbitrator shall not be permitted to modify any of the terms of this Lease). The
arbitrator's  determination shall be final and binding upon the parties, whether
or not a  judgment  shall be  entered in any court.  All  actions  necessary  to
implement such decision shall be undertaken as soon as possible, but in no event
later  than  10  Business  Days  after  the  rendering  of  such  decision.  The
arbitrator's  determination  may be  entered  in any court  having  jurisdiction
thereof.  All fees payable to the AAA for services  rendered in connection  with
the  resolution  of the dispute  shall be paid by the  unsuccessful  party.  The
arbitrator shall not be entitled to award monetary damages.


     IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  Landlord and Tenant have executed this Lease as of the
day and year first above written.

                                R E C I T A L S:


         A. Lender is the  present  owner and holder of a certain  Mortgage  and
Modification Agreement dated as of January 23, 1998 (collectively, the "Security
Instrument") given by Landlord (defined below) to Lender which encumbers the fee

(the "Property") and which secures the payment of certain  indebtedness  owed by
Landlord to Lender  evidenced by a certain Amended and Restated  Promissory Note
dated as of January 23, 1998, given by Landlord (the "Note");

         B.  Tenant is the  holder  of a  leasehold  estate in a portion  of the
Property  under and pursuant to the  provisions  of a certain  lease dated as of
July 22, 1999, between 405 Lexington, L.L.C., as landlord ("Landlord"),  and
Tenant, (the "Lease"); and

         C.  Tenant  has  agreed  to  subordinate  the  Lease  to  the  Security
Instruments   and  to  the  lien  thereof,   and  Lender  has  agreed  to  grant
non-disturbance  to Tenant and its  permitted  subtenants  and assigns under the
Lease on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.


                                A G R E E M E N T


     For good and valuable consideration, Tenant and Lender agree as follows:

     1.  Subordination.  Tenant  agrees  that the  Lease  and all of the  terms,
covenants  and  provisions  thereof and all Tenant's  right,  title and interest
under  the  Lease  are  and  shall  at all  times  continue  to be  subject  and
subordinate in all respects to the Security Instruments and to the lien thereof,
including,   without  limitation,   all  renewals,   increases,   modifications,
spreaders,  consolidations,  replacements and extensions thereof and to all sums
secured  thereby with the same force and effect as if the  Security  Instruments
had been executed, delivered and recorded prior to the execution and delivery of
the Lease.


<PAGE>


     2.  Non-Disturbance.  Lender  agrees  that if any action or  proceeding  is
commenced by Lender for the  foreclosure of or otherwise to enforce the Security
Instruments  or the  sale  of the  Property,  Tenant  and  any of its  permitted
subtenants  shall not be named as a party  therein  unless such joinder shall be
required  by law;  provided  however,  such  joinder  shall  not  result  in the
termination of the Lease or disturb the Tenant's or such subtenant's  possession
or use of the premises demised  thereunder,  and the sale of the Property in any
such action or proceeding  and the exercise by Lender of any of its other rights
under  the Note or the  Security  Instrument,  including,  but not  limited  to,
Lender's  seeking the  appointment  of a receiver or accepting a deed in lieu of
foreclosure  or otherwise  succeeding to the rights of Landlord under the Lease,
shall be made subject to all rights of Tenant and its  permitted  assigns  under
the Lease,  provided that at the time of the  commencement of any such action or
proceeding  or at the time of any such sale or exercise of any such other rights
(a) the term of the Lease shall have commenced, or is due to commence,  pursuant
to the  provisions  thereof,  (b) Tenant or its permitted  subtenants or assigns
shall be in  possession  of the  premises  demised  under  the Lease (or will be

default under any of the terms,  covenants or conditions of the Lease or of this
Agreement  on Tenant's  part to be observed or performed  after having  received

this Agreement is intended to or shall impair,  diminish or affect the rights of
Landlord to enforce  any  obligation  of Tenant  under the Lease or to take such
action as is available to Landlord  thereunder or under applicable law by reason
of any  default  under the Lease  beyond  any  applicable  periods of notice and
grace.

     3. Attornment.  Lender and Tenant agree that if Lender shall succeed to the
rights of Landlord  under the Lease or shall become the owner of the Property by
reason of the  foreclosure  of the Security  Instruments  or the acceptance of a
deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure  or otherwise,  and the conditions set
forth in Section 2 above have been met at the time Lender becomes such successor
or owner of the Property,  the Lease shall not be terminated or affected thereby
but shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between Lender and
Tenant upon all of the terms,  covenants and  conditions set forth in the Lease,
and in that event, Tenant agrees to attorn to Lender and Lender agrees to accept
such  attornment;  provided,  however,  that  the  provisions  of  the  Security
Instrument  shall  govern  with  respect  to the  disposition  of  any  casualty
insurance proceeds or condemnation  awards and Lender shall not be (a) obligated
to complete any  construction  work required to be done by Landlord  pursuant to
the provisions of the Lease, or to reimburse  Tenant for any  construction  work
done by  Tenant,  (b) liable (i) for  Landlord's  failure to perform  any of its

or after such  foreclosure  or sale;  (c)  required  to make any  repairs to the
Property  or to the  premises  demised  under the Lease  required as a result of
fire, or other casualty or by reason of  condemnation  unless  Landlord shall be
obligated  under the Lease to make such repairs,  and Lender shall have received
or be entitled to receive sufficient casualty insurance proceeds or condemnation
awards to finance  the  completion  of such  repairs;  (d)  required to make any
capital  improvements to the

Lease; (e) subject to any offsets,  defenses,  abatements or counterclaims which
shall  have  accrued  to Tenant  against  Landlord  prior to the date upon which

by Lender;  (h) bound to make any payment to Tenant which was required under the
Lease,  otherwise to be made prior to the time Lender  succeeded  to  Landlord's

Landlord under the Lease until further notice from Lender,  and Landlord  hereby
expressly  authorizes  Tenant to make such  payments to Lender and hereby agrees

        SELECTED PORTIONS OF ADVENT'S 1999 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS

                MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                      CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     We are the  leading  provider of  stand-alone  and  client/server  software
products,  data  interfaces and related  maintenance and services that automate,
integrate  and  support  mission-critical  functions  of  investment  management
organizations.   Our  clients  vary  significantly  in  size  and  assets  under
management and include investment advisors, brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds,
corporations, public funds, universities and non-profit organizations.

ACQUISITIONS

     In February  1998, we issued 750,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for
all of the  outstanding  shares of  MicroEdge,  a leading  provider  of software
products to foundations,  corporations  and other  organizations to manage their
grant-making  activities.  This  business  combination  was  accounted  for as a
pooling of interests  and the results of operations of MicroEdge are included in
the financial statements beginning January 1, 1998. The results of operations as
well as the assets and  liabilities  of MicroEdge in 1997, or prior years,  were
not material to the  consolidated  results of operations or financial  position.
Accordingly,  we did not restate our financial  statements  for periods prior to
January 1, 1998.

     In May 1998, we issued 510,000 shares of Common Stock for certain assets of
the Grants  Management  Division of  Blackbaud,  Inc., a privately  held company
located in Charleston,  South Carolina. Through this acquisition we combined the
Grants Management product line of Blackbaud with MicroEdge. This transaction was
accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  of the business and
assets  acquired  are  included  in our  financial  statements  from the date of
acquisition.   We  incurred  a  charge  relating  to  in-process   research  and
development  and  other  expenses  of  $5.4  million  in  connection  with  this
transaction.   We  believe  that  the   technology   required  had  not  reached
technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use. Other intangibles
of $2.0 million were recorded in connection with this  acquisition and are being
amortized over a period of 5 years.

     In November  1998,  we issued  45,000  shares of Common Stock and paid $4.1
million  in  exchange  for all the  outstanding  shares  of Hub  Data,  Inc.,  a
distributor  of  consolidated  securities  information  and  data to  investment
management  organizations.  Hub Data is located in  Cambridge,  MA and  delivers
services to over 240 institutional  investment firms. This business  combination
was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of operations  for Hub Data are
included in our  financial  statements  beginning on the  acquisition  date.  We
incurred a charge  relating  to  in-process  research  and  development  of $3.0
million in  connection  with this  transaction.  We believe that the  technology
acquired had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. As a result of net  liabilities  assumed and  acquisition  expenses of $1.6
million,  goodwill  of  $3.2  million  was  recorded  in  connection  with  this
transaction and is being amortized over a 7 year period.

     In November  1998,  we paid AUS  $583,000  (approximately  US  $370,000) in
exchange for all the outstanding shares of Portfolio  Management  Systems,  Pty.
Ltd., a distributor of Advent products in Australia.  This business  combination
was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  are included in
our financial  statements  beginning on the acquisition  date. This  acquisition
provides an  international  channel for sale of our products and services.  As a
result of net  liabilities  assumed and  acquisition  expenses of $2.0  million,
goodwill of $2.4 million was recorded in connection with this transaction and is
being  amortized over a period of 10 years.  Subsequent to the  acquisition,  we
changed the name of this subsidiary to Advent Australia.

DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIP

     We rely on a  number  of  strategic  alliances  to help us  achieve  market
acceptance of our products and to leverage our development, sales, and marketing
resources. In the third quarter of 1999, our existing distributor in Scandinavia
formed Advent Europe to distribute  the Advent Office suite  throughout  most of
the European Community.  Advent Europe,  incorporated in The Netherlands,  is an
independent entity and is financially backed by our Scandinavian


                                       20

distributor. It will make tax and language modifications to Advent Office to fit
the  various  needs of the local  jurisdictions  and then market and license the
Advent  Office  suite.  All  transactions  between  Advent Europe and us will be
transacted in U.S. dollars.

SECONDARY OFFERING

     In June 1999,  we  completed  a  secondary  public  offering of 3.9 million
shares of Common  Stock at an offering  price of $20.688  per share.  Of the 3.9
million  shares of Common Stock  offered,  300,000 shares were sold by a selling
stockholder. The net proceeds of the offering to Advent were $70.2 million.

STOCK SPLITS

     Our Board of Directors  approved a three-for-two  split of our Common Stock
in July 1999. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend.  Stockholders of
record as of the close of business  on July 30,  1999 were issued a  certificate
representing  one  additional  Common Share for every two shares of Common Stock
held on the record date. These certificates were distributed on August 16, 1999.
This stock split increased the number of shares  outstanding from  approximately
9.6 million shares to approximately 14.4 million shares.

     Our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our Common Stock in
February 2000. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend. Stockholders of
record  as of the  close  of  business  on  February  28,  2000  were  issued  a
certificate  representing  one additional  Common Share for each share of Common
Stock held on the record date. These  certificates were distributed on March 13,
2000.  This  stock  split  increased  the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock
outstanding from approximately 14.8 million shares to approximately 29.6 million
shares.

     All  shares  and per share  data in this Form  10-K have been  adjusted  to
reflect both stock splits.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997

REVENUES

     Net revenues were $102 million, $71 million, and $49 million in 1999, 1998,
and 1997, respectively,  representing increases of 43% from 1998 to 1999 and 46%
from 1997 to 1998.  Our net revenues  are derived  from license and  development
fees,  maintenance and other recurring revenues,  and professional  services and
other revenues related to our software products. In each of 1999, 1998 and 1997,
the majority of our net revenues were from domestic  sales,  with  international
sales  representing  less than 8% of net revenues.  License revenues are derived
from the licensing of software  products while development fees are derived from
development contracts that we have entered into with other companies,  including
customers and development partners. Maintenance and other recurring revenues are
derived from maintenance fees charged in the initial licensing year, renewals of
annual maintenance services in subsequent years and revenues derived from client
utilization of proprietary  interfaces to access pricing and other data supplied
by third  parties.  Professional  services and other  revenues  include fees for
consulting,  implementation  and  integration  management,  custom  programming,
training services and semi-annual conferences.

     Axys and its related products and services accounted for the majority of
net  revenues  in 1999,  1998 and  1997.  However,  we have been  successful  in
increasing  multi-product  sales  by  emphasizing  our  suite of  products  and,
therefore, new products have accounted for an increasing portion of net revenues
in all three years.

     Each  of  the  major  revenue  categories  has  historically  varied  as  a
percentage of net revenues and we expect this  variability to continue in future
periods.  This variability is primarily due to the timing of the introduction of
new products,  the relative size and timing of individual  licenses,  as well as
the  complexity  of  the  implementation,   the  resulting   proportion  of  the
maintenance and professional  services components of these license  transactions
and the amount of client utilization of pricing and related data.

     LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT  FEES.  License and  development  fees revenue were
$49.3  million,  $36.6  million  and  $23.7  million  in 1999,  1998  and  1997,
respectively,  representing increases of 35% from 1998 to 1999 and 54% from 1997
to 1998.  License and development  fees revenues as a percentage of net revenues
were 49%,  52% and 49% in 1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively.  The  increase in
absolute dollars from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to increased


                                       21
<PAGE>

demand for the Advent Office suite and increased  demand for our Geneva software
which is sold primarily to global  financial  institutions,  partially offset by
decreased  development fees from certain development  partners.  The increase in
absolute dollars from 1997 to 1998 was primarily due to continued demand for our
Advent Office suite and  increased  development  fees. We typically  license our
products on a per server,  per user basis with the price per site varying  based
on the selection of the products licensed and the number of authorized users. As
we carry out larger implementations and continue our Internet initiative, we may
enter into further development contracts through which we earn development fees.
In 1999  and  1998,  license  revenues  also  increased  due to an  increase  of
multi-product  transactions.   We  expect  these  transactions  to  continue  to
represent a significant proportion of revenues.

     MAINTENANCE AND OTHER RECURRING.  Maintenance and other recurring  revenues
were $38.2  million,  $25.5  million and $18.0  million in 1999,  1998 and 1997,
respectively,  representing increases of 50% from 1998 to 1999 and 42% from 1997
to 1998.  Maintenance  and other  recurring  revenues,  as a  percentage  of net
revenues, were 38%, 36% and 37% in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The growth
in maintenance and other recurring revenues, in absolute dollars, in all periods
was primarily due to a larger customer base and higher average maintenance fees.
Higher average maintenance fees are primarily due to the increased complexity of
the  maintenance  services  provided  and  increased  client use of  proprietary
interfaces to access pricing and other data provided by our Hub Data  subsidiary
as well as those supplied by external parties. Our proprietary interfaces enable
users of the Advent  Office  suite as well as Geneva to retrieve  critical  data
from external sources,  including pricing, corporate actions, and analytical and
fundamental  data via  interfaces to  information  vendors,  such as Interactive
Data.  In  addition,  in 1999 and  1998,  increased  demand  for  implementation
management  support  and the  growth  of our  client  base due to  multi-product
transactions  contributed  to the increase in  maintenance  and other  recurring
revenues. The acquisitions we made in 1998, to a lesser extent, also contributed
to the rise in maintenance and other recurring revenues during 1999.

     PROFESSIONAL  SERVICES AND OTHER.  Professional services and other revenues
were $14.1  million,  $8.9  million  and $6.9  million  in 1999,  1998 and 1997,
respectively,  representing increases of 58% from 1998 to 1999 and 29% from 1997
to 1998.  Professional  services  and  other  revenues  as a  percentage  of net
revenues were relatively  stable at 14% for 1999, 12% for 1998 and 14% for 1997.
Professional  services and other  revenues  increased  $5.2 million from 1998 to
1999 and $2.0  million  from 1997 to 1998.  The  increase  from 1998 to 1999 was
primarily  due  to  higher  consulting  fees  due to  the  increasingly  complex
implementations at larger financial institutions, increased services provided by
our MicroEdge  subsidiary  and increased  revenues from our  semi-annual  client
conferences.  The increase  from 1997 to 1998 was  primarily  due to  additional
consulting  revenue associated with higher product sales activity and additional
interface business resulting from higher market demand for automated interfaces.
In 1999 and 1998, the increase was also attributed to increased consulting fees.

COST OF REVENUES

     COST OF LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT  FEES. Cost of license and development fees
revenues were $3.6 million,  $2.9 million,  and $601,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively,  representing  7%,  8%  and 3% of  license  and  development  fees
revenues in these periods,  respectively.  Cost of license and development  fees
revenue  consists  primarily  of the  cost of  product  media  and  duplication,
manuals,  packaging  materials,  the direct  labor  involved  in  producing  and
distributing  our software as well as royalties paid to third  parties.  Cost of
license and development  fees as a percentage of related  revenues  between 1999
and 1998 decreased slightly due to decreased development fee revenues which have
higher related costs.  The increase from 1997 to 1998 was primarily due to costs
associated  with increased  development  fee projects that have a higher cost of
revenue.  The increase in absolute dollars in all years is primarily  related to
increased revenues.

     COST OF MAINTENANCE  AND OTHER  RECURRING.  Cost of  maintenance  and other
recurring  revenues were $10.4  million,  $6.3 million and $4.8 million in 1999,
1998 and 1997,  respectively,  representing  27%, 25% and 27% of maintenance and
other  recurring  revenues  in these  periods,  respectively.  These  costs  are
primarily comprised of the direct costs of providing technical support and other
services for recurring  revenues,  the engineering costs associated with product
updates and  royalties  paid to third party data  vendors.  These  expenses,  in
absolute dollars,  increased in each year due to increased  staffing required to
support  a larger  customer  base and more  complex  implementations  as well as
increased  royalties paid to third party vendors as a result of increasing  data
revenues from our clients' use of proprietary interfaces.

     COST OF PROFESSIONAL  SERVICES AND OTHER. Cost of professional services and
other  revenues were $5.3 million,  $3.9 million and $3.6 million in 1999,  1998
and 1997,  respectively,  representing 38%, 44% and 53% of professional services
and other revenues in these periods, respectively. These costs consist primarily
of personnel related costs of the client services and support  organization that
are incurred in providing  consulting,  custom programming,  conversions of data
from clients' previous systems,  and cost of hosting our client conferences.  To
the  extent  that such  personnel  are not fully used in  consulting,  training,
conversion  or custom  programming  projects,  they are  allocated  to presales,
marketing and  engineering  activities  and the  resultant  costs are charged to
operating  expenses.  Cost of  professional  services  and  other,  in  absolute
dollars,  increased year to year due to increase  staffing  necessary to provide
services to an  expanded  installed  base.  Cost of  professional  services as a
percentage  of related  revenues  decreased  from 1998 to 1999  primarily due to
revenues increasing faster than expenses.

OPERATING EXPENSES

     SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses were $32.2 million, $23.5
million and $15.6  million in 1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively,  representing
increases  of 37%  from  1998 to 1999  and 51%  from  1997 to  1998.  Sales  and
marketing expenses,  as a percentage of net revenues remained steady at 32%, 33%
and 32% in 1999,  1998 and  1997,  respectively.  Sales and  marketing  expenses
consist  primarily  of the  costs of all  personnel  involved  in the  sales and
marketing  process,  sales commissions,  advertising and promotional  materials,
sales  facilities  expense,  trade  shows,  and  seminars.  Sales and  marketing
expenses, in absolute dollars, increased from 1997 to 1998 and from 1998 to 1999
due to the  continued  increase in sales and  marketing  employees and increased
marketing  efforts towards the Advent Office suite and our Internet  Initiative.
The year over year growth in sales and marketing  expenses  were higher  between
1997 and 1998 because of our initial efforts towards our Internet initiative and
other new product introductions.

     PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. Product development expenses were $16.8 million, $12.6
million  and $9.4  million in 1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively,  representing
increases  of 33% from 1998 to 1999 and from 1997 to 1998.  Product  development
expenses as a percentage of net revenues were relatively  stable at 17%, 18% and
19% in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Product development expenses increased
in absolute  dollars  primarily  due to an increase in personnel as we increased
our product development  efforts to accelerate the rate of product  enhancements
and new product  introductions.  Product development expenses as a percentage of
net revenues  have been  declining  due to revenues  increasing at a faster rate
than the  expenses.  Development  costs prior to  achievement  of  technological
feasibility are expensed as product  development  costs in the period  incurred.
Once the point of technological  feasibility is reached,  development  costs are
capitalized.  No software  development costs have been capitalized  during 1999,
1998 or 1997.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative  expenses were $9.9
million,  $7.5  million and $5.1 million in 1999,  1998 and 1997,  respectively,
representing  increases  of 31% from  1998 to 1999  and 47%  from  1997 to 1998.
General and administrative  expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 10% in
1999 and 11% in 1998 and  1997.  General  and  administrative  expenses  consist
primarily of personnel costs for finance, administration, operations and general
management, as well as legal and accounting expenses. The increases from 1998 to
1999 and from 1997 to 1998 were  primarily due to increased  staffing to support
our growth.

     AMORTIZATION  OF  INTANGIBLES.  We recorded  amortization of intangibles of
approximately $1.5 million for 1999. This was based on recorded goodwill of $5.6
million in connection  with the  acquisitions  of HubData and Advent  Australia,
formerly named Portfolio  Management  Systems,  Pty. Ltd. As of this filing,  we
have made  progress  on the  development  efforts  associated  with the  HubData
products.  In addition,  the revenue and costs  associated  with the  in-process
technology have been  materially  consistent with the assumptions we used in the
valuation.  Since the valuation was based on our estimates of market  potential,
product  introductions,  and technology trends, we will periodically  assess our
estimates  related to the  valuation  model to determine if the assets  acquired
have been impaired. If we determine that there has been impairment,  there could
be additional charges to income.

     PURCHASED  RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT  AND  OTHER.  In May 1998,  we issued
510,000  shares of Common  Stock for  certain  assets of the  Grants  Management
Division of Blackbaud,  Inc. and incurred a charge for  in-process  research and
development  and  other  expenses  of  $5.4  million  in  connection  with  this
transaction.  In November 1998, we incurred a charge for in-process research and
development of $3.0 million in connection  with the  acquisition of Hub Data. In
determining  the amount of in-process  research and  development,  we engaged an
independent  valuation firm to conduct an appraisal of the acquired assets.  The
intangible  assets  acquired,  including  in-process  research  and  development


                                       23
<PAGE>

expenses,  were valued based on estimates of future net cash flows discounted to
their present value at risk-adjusted rates of return.

     The in-process  research and development charge for Hub Data was determined
by  estimating  the net cash  flows  from the  sale of the  resulting  projects,
discounted  to net present value using a 25% discount rate and also assumed that
the project was approximately 61% complete.

     The Blackbaud  transaction  resulted in the  acquisition of certain assets,
but not an ongoing business.  The assets acquired included rights to Blackbaud's
32-bit in-process technology, access to certain Blackbaud source code to be used
in developing the new Advent products, a non-compete agreement and access to the
Blackbaud  customer  base.  The acquired  technology  was  purchased  for use in
Advent's  research  and  development  "grant  management"  project  and  had  no
alternative future use.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

     Interest and other income, net was approximately $4.6 million, $1.4 million
and $1.2  million  in 1999,  1998 and  1997,  respectively.  Interest  and other
income,  net consists of interest  income,  interest  expense and  miscellaneous
non-operating  income and expense items.  The increase from 1997 to 1998 was due
to greater interest income generated from higher cash and short-term  investment
balances.  The increase from 1998 to 1999 was due to higher interest income from
the increased cash received from our secondary offering and from a one-time gain
of $1.2 million from the sale of securities.  The securities  were warrants from
one of our strategic partners as part of our initial business relationship which
we converted to stock and sold during the fourth quarter.

INCOME TAXES

     We had  effective  income tax rates of 34%,  40% and 37% in 1999,  1998 and
1997, respectively. These rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily
due to state income tax, offset by certain research and development credits. The
lower  income  tax rate in 1999 was  primarily  due to tax  planning  strategies
implemented  in the  second  half of 1998.  The  higher  rate in 1998 was due to
certain   acquisition  related  charges  incurred  during  1998  that  were  not
deductible for tax purposes.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Our cash and cash  equivalents  at December  31,  1999 were $64.3  million,
increasing  by $28.7  million  from $35.6  million at  December  31,  1998.  The
increase was due to $77.0  million  provided by financing  activities  and $19.0
million  provided  by  operating  activities  offset  by $67.3  million  used in
investing activities.

     The net cash provided from operating  activities for 1999 was primarily due
to net income and increases in deferred revenues and accrued  liabilities offset
by  increases  in  accounts  receivable  as well as  prepaid  and other  assets.
Financing  activities  provided  $77.0 million for 1999,  primarily due to $70.2
million of proceeds from our secondary offering. The remaining was from proceeds
of the exercise of stock options and issuance of Common Stock in connection with
our employee stock purchase plan. Net cash used in investing activities of $67.3
million for 1999 related primarily to the purchases of short-term investments of
$52.6 million and  expenditures  for  furniture,  fixtures and equipment of $8.3
million.  Further  activity  included  prepayment of $7.0 million to a recurring
revenue partner to further bring new products and services to our clients.

     At  December  31,  1999,  we had  $121.9  million in  working  capital.  We
currently have no significant  capital  commitments other than commitments under
operating leases. We believe that our available sources of funds and anticipated
cash flows from operations  will be adequate to finance  current  operations and
anticipated capital expenditures through, at least, fiscal 2000.

IMPACT OF YEAR 2000 ISSUE

     To the best of our knowledge,  the products we currently  license have been
designed  to be and  continue  to be Year  2000  compliant.  To date we have not
experienced  any major issues from the products we currently  license  regarding
Year 2000 compliance.  Year 2000 compliant means that our products will continue
to operate substantially in


                                       24
<PAGE>

accordance  with  published  documentation  on and after  January 1,  2000.  Our
internal  systems,  to the  best  of our  knowledge  continue  to be  Year  2000
compliant.  To date, we have  experienced no major issues regarding our internal
operations regarding Year 2000 compliance, and before, during and after the date
change  on Jan 1,  2000,  no  Year  2000  related  interruption  in  either  the
operations of systems or business  processes has occurred.  We do not anticipate
any significant additional Year 2000 issues or costs at this point.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In March 1998, AcSec issued SOP 98-1,  Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software  Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 requires that certain
costs  related to the  development  or  purchase  of  internal-use  software  be
capitalized  and amortized over the estimated  useful life of the software.  SOP
98-1 is effective for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning
after  December  15, 1998.  The adoption of SOP 98-1 did not have a  significant
impact on the Company's results of operations.

     In  June of  1998,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  133,   "Accounting   for  Derivative   Instruments  and  Hedging
Activities," which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments,  and for hedging  activities.  It requires that an entity recognize
all  derivatives  as either assets or  liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure those  instruments  at fair value.  Management  has not yet
evaluated the effects of this change on its operations.

     In December 1998,  the Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee  (AcSEC)
released  Statement of Position  98-9,  or SOP 98-9,  Modification  of SOP 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition," with respect to certain  transactions.  SOP 98-9
amends SOP 97-2 to require that an entity recognize revenue for multiple element
arrangements by means of the "residual method" when (1) there is vendor-specific
objective  evidence  (VSOE) of the fair values of all the  undelivered  elements
that are not accounted for by means of long-term contract  accounting,  (2) VSOE
of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements,  and (3)
all revenue  recognition  criteria of SOP 97-2 (other than the  requirement  for
VSOE of the fair value of each delivered element) are satisfied.

     The  provisions of SOP 98-9 that extend the deferral of certain  paragraphs
of SOP 97-2 became effective December 15, 1998. These paragraphs of SOP 97-2 and
SOP 98-9 will be  effective  for  transactions  that are entered  into in fiscal
years beginning after March 15, 1999. Retroactive application is prohibited.  We
have  evaluated the  requirements  of SOP 98-9 and do not believe it will have a
material impact on our current revenue recognition policies.

     In July 1999, the FASB issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
No. 137, or SFAS No. 137,  Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities - Deferral of the  Effective  Date of FASB No. 133. SFAS 137 deferred
the effective  date of SFAS 133 until the first fiscal quarter  beginning  after
June 15, 2000.

     In December  1999,  the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin  No.  101 (SAB  101),  "Revenue  Recognition  in  Financial
Statements."  SAB 101 provides  guidance for revenue  recognition  under certain
circumstances.  We  are  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  SAB  101 on our
financial  statements and related  disclosures.  The accounting and  disclosures
prescribed by SAB 101 will be effective  for our fiscal year ended  December 31,
2000.

RISK FACTORS AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     The  discussion  in  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial
Condition  and  Results of  Operations"  and  elsewhere  in this  Annual  Report
contains trend analysis and other  forward-looking  statements that are based on
current  expectations  and  assumptions  made  by  management.   Words  such  as
"expects", "anticipates",  "intends", "plans", "believes", "seeks", "estimates",
and  variations of such words and similar  expressions  are intended to identify
such forward-looking  statements.  These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties,  which are difficult to
predict.  Therefore, actual results could differ materially from those expressed
or  forecasted  in the  forward-looking  statements  as a result of the  factors
summarized  below and other risks  detailed  from time to time in reports  filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 1999 Annual Report to
Stockholders,   incorporated   by  reference  in  our  1999  Form  10-K  Report.
Additionally,  the  financial  statements  for  the  periods  presented  are not
necessarily  indicative of results to be expected for any future period.


                                       24

     We  operate in a rapidly  changing  environment  that  involves a number of
risks,  some of which are beyond our control.  These risks include the potential
for period to period fluctuations in operating results and the dependence on the
successful  development  and  market  acceptance  of new  products  and  product
enhancements  on a timely,  cost  effective  basis,  as well as the stability of
financial  markets,  maintenance of our  relationship  with Interactive Data and
price and product/performance  competition.  In particular, our net revenues and
operating results have varied substantially from period-to-period on a quarterly
basis and may  continue to  fluctuate  due to a number of factors.  Our software
products  typically  are  shipped  shortly  after  receipt  of a signed  license
agreement.  License backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents
only a small  portion of that  quarter's  expected  revenues.  In  addition,  as
licenses into multi-user networked environments increase both in individual size
and number, the timing and size of individual license  transactions are becoming
increasingly  important factors in our quarterly  operating  results.  The sales
cycles for these  transactions  are often  lengthy  and  unpredictable,  and the
ability to close large  license  transactions  on a timely basis or at all could
cause additional  variability in our quarterly  operating results.  In addition,
our results could be adversely  impacted by generic  issues  surrounding  market
volatility,  global economic  uncertainty and reductions in capital expenditures
by large  customers.  The target  clients  for our  products  include a range of
organizations that manage investment portfolios,  including investment advisors,
brokerage  firms,  banks and hedge funds. In addition,  we target  corporations,
public  funds,  universities  and  non-profit  organizations,  which also manage
investment  portfolios  and have many of the same needs.  The success of many of
our clients is intrinsically  linked to the health of the financial markets.  We
believe that demand for our  products  could be  disproportionately  affected by
fluctuations,  disruptions,  instability  or downturns in the financial  markets
which may cause  clients and  potential  clients to exit the  industry or delay,
cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment  management systems and
software products.

     Our future  success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop our
products,  such as Advent Office suite, and Geneva, that continue to address the
future needs of our target markets and to respond to emerging industry standards
and practices.  We are directing a significant amount of our product development
efforts to the on-going development of Geneva. The failure to achieve widespread
market  acceptance  of Geneva  on a timely  basis  would  adversely  affect  our
business and  operating  results.  To take  advantage of the  Internet,  we have
launched  an  Internet  Initiative  whereby  we are  developing  services,  both
announced  and  unannounced,  to bring  Internet-based  products and services to
clients.  As we continue to develop new products and services,  we have and will
continue  to enter  into  development  agreements  with  information  providers,
clients,  or other companies in order to accelerate the delivery of new products
and services.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing
our existing products, new product or modifications of our products. Our failure
to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     OPERATIONS We provide stand-alone and client/server software products, data
interfaces and related  maintenance  and services that  automate,  integrate and
support certain mission-critical  functions of the front, middle and back office
of investment management  organizations.  Our clients vary significantly in size
and assets under management and include  investment  advisors,  brokerage firms,
banks, hedge funds,  corporations,  public funds, foundations,  universities and
non-profit organizations.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated  financial  statements include
the  accounts  of Advent and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  All  intercompany
transactions and amounts have been eliminated.

     CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS  Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid
investments  purchased  with an  original  maturity  of 90 days or  less.  These
securities are maintained with major financial institutions.

     MARKETABLE SECURITIES Short-term marketable securities are securities with
maturities  greater than 90 days but less than one year.  They are classified as
held-to-maturity  securities,  stated at cost and adjusted for  amortization  of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Amounts reported for short-term
investments  are  considered to  approximate  the fair value based on comparable
market information available at the respective balance sheet dates. Realized and
unrealized investment gains and losses have not been significant.

     FAIR  VALUE  OF  FINANCIAL   INSTRUMENTS  The  amounts  reported  for  cash
equivalents,  marketable  securities,  receivables,  accounts  payable,  accrued
liabilities and other financial  instruments are considered to approximate their
market values based on comparable market information available at the respective
balance sheet dates, and their short-term nature.

     Financial  instruments that  potentially  subject us to  concentrations  of
credit risks comprise,  principally, cash, short-term marketable securities, and
trade accounts  receivable.  We invest excess cash through banks,  mutual funds,
and brokerage houses  primarily in highly liquid  securities and have investment
policies and procedures which are reviewed periodically to minimize credit risk.
Advent does not require  collateral  from its  customers  but  performs  ongoing
credit  evaluations  and maintains  reserves for  potential  credit losses which
historically have been within management's estimates.

     DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation
of leasehold  improvements is computed using the  straight-line  method over the
shorter of the estimated  useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term.
Other  fixed  assets are  depreciated  using the  straight-line  method over the
estimated useful life of the related assets, generally five years.

     CAPITALIZED  SOFTWARE  Costs  incurred  for software  development  prior to
technological  feasibility  are  expensed  as product  development  costs in the
period  incurred.  Once  the  point of  technological  feasibility  is  reached,
development  costs are  capitalized.  No  software  costs have been  capitalized
during 1999, 1998 or 1997.

     INVESTMENTS  Investments consisted of nonmarketable  investments in private
companies,  which are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable  value. The
estimated  aggregate fair value of these  investments  approximated the carrying
amount at December 31, 1999.

     REVENUE  RECOGNITION  We license  application  software  programs and offer
annual  maintenance  programs which provide for technical support and updates to
software products.  Our development agreements generally provide for development
of technologies and products which are expected to become part of our product or
product offerings in the future. Certain agreements may require royalty payments
based on future sales of the developed  products.  Such amounts will be included
in costs of goods sold. We also offer  customers  on-site  consulting  services,
training, custom programming, and other services.

     We adopted the  provisions  of  Statement  of Position  97-2,  or SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by Statement of Position 98-4, Deferral
of the Effective Date of Certain  Provisions of SOP 97-2,  effective  January 1,
1998.  SOP  97-2  supersedes   Statement  of  Position  91-1,  Software  Revenue
Recognition,  and delineates the accounting for software product and maintenance
revenue. Under SOP 97-2, we recognize license revenue upon shipment of a product
to

the client if a signed contract  exists,  the fee is fixed and  determinable and
collection of resulting  receivables  is probable.  For contracts  with multiple
obligations (e.g. deliverable and undeliverable products,  maintenance and other
services),  we  allocate  revenue to each  component  of the  contract  based on
objective  evidence of its fair value,  which is specific to the client,  or for
products not being sold  separately,  the price  established by  management.  We
recognize  revenue  allocated  to  undelivered  products  when the  criteria for
product  revenue set forth  above are met. We  recognize  revenue  allocated  to
maintenance  fees for ongoing  customer support and product updates ratably over
the  period of the  maintenance  contract.  Payments  for  maintenance  fees are
generally  made in advance and are  non-refundable.  Revenues for  interface and
other development and custom  programming are recognized using the percentage of
completion  method of  accounting  based on the costs  incurred to date compared
with the estimated cost of completion.  Revenues from professional  services are
recognized as work is performed.

     In December 1998,  the Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee  (AcSEC)
released  Statement of Position  98-9,  or SOP 98-9,  Modification  of SOP 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition," with respect to certain  transactions.  SOP 98-9
amends SOP 97-2 to require that an entity recognize revenue for multiple element
arrangements by means of the "residual method" when (1) there is vendor-specific
objective  evidence  (VSOE) of the fair values of all the  undelivered  elements
that are not accounted for by means of long-term contract  accounting,  (2) VSOE
of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements,  and (3)
all revenue  recognition  criteria of SOP 97-2 (other than the  requirement  for
VSOE of the fair value of each delivered element) are satisfied.

     The  provisions of SOP 98-9 that extend the deferral of certain  paragraphs
of SOP 97-2 became effective December 15, 1998. These paragraphs of SOP 97-2 and
SOP 98-9 will be  effective  for  transactions  that are entered  into in fiscal
years beginning after March 15, 1999. Retroactive application is prohibited.  We
have  evaluated the  requirements  of SOP 98-9 and do not believe it will have a
material impact on our current revenue recognition policies.

     NET INCOME PER SHARE Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net
income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares  outstanding  for that  period.  Diluted net income per share is computed
giving  effect to all dilutive  potential  common  shares that were  outstanding
during the period.  Dilutive  potential  shares  consist of  incremental  common
shares  issuable upon  exercise of stock options and warrants and  conversion of
preferred stock for all periods.  All share and per-share data presented reflect
the  three-for-two  stock  split paid in August  1999 and the  two-for one stock
split paid in March 2000 (See footnote 8).

     RECLASSIFICATIONS  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to the
current year presentation.

     COMPREHENSIVE  INCOME  We have  adopted  the  provisions  of  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income",
effective   January  1,  1998.   This  statement   requires  the  disclosure  of
comprehensive  income  and  its  components  in a full  set  of  general-purpose
financial  statements.  Comprehensive  income  is  the  change  in  equity  from
transactions and other events and circumstances  other than those resulting from
investments by owners and distributions to owners.

     SEGMENT INFORMATION We adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of
an  Enterprise  and Related  Information,"  which is effective  for fiscal years
beginning  after  December  31,  1997.  SFAS No.  131  supersedes  SFAS No.  14,
"Financial  Reporting  for  Segments  of a  Business  Enterprise."  SFAS No. 131
changes  current  practice under SFAS No. 14 by  establishing a new framework on
which  to  base  segment  reporting  and  introduces  requirements  for  interim
reporting of segment information.

     We have determined that Advent has a single reportable  segment  consisting
of the development, marketing and sale of stand-alone and client/server software
products,  data  interfaces and related  maintenance and services that automate,
integrate  and  support  certain  mission   critical   functions  of  investment
management organizations.

     Management uses one measurement of profitability  and does not disaggregate
its business for internal reporting.  Our international operations in 1999, 1998
and 1997 have not been material to revenue or net income.

     USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  the
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues


                                       32
<PAGE>

and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.  These  estimates  are  based  on
information available as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

     ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-LIVED  ASSETS We review property,  equipment,  goodwill
and other  intangible  assets  for  impairment  whenever  events or  changes  in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may  not  be
recoverable.  Recoverability is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to
future net cash flows the assets are  expected to  generate.  If such assets are
considered  to be impaired,  the  impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying  amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
Intangibles are amortized over their estimated  useful lives  (typically five to
ten years).

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION  The functional  currency of the our foreign
subsidiary  is the  local  currency,  the  Australian  dollar.  All  assets  and
liabilities  denominated in foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at
the exchange  rate on the balance sheet date.  Revenues,  costs and expenses are
translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period.  Gains and
losses  resulting  from  foreign  currency  transactions  are  included  in  the
consolidated statements of operations and have not been significant, to date.

     ADVERTISING  COSTS  We  expense   advertising  costs  as  incurred.   Total
advertising expenses were approximately $173,000,  $134,000 and $173,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

     STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION  We  elected  to  continue  to use the  intrinsic
value-based  method as allowed under  Accounting  Principles Board (APB) Opinion
No. 25,  Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees,  to account for all of its
stock-based  employee  compensation plans.  Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,  we are required to disclose the pro forma effects
on  operating  results as if we had  elected to use the fair value  approach  to
account for all its stock-based employee compensation plans (See footnote 8).

     NEW  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS  In March  1998,  AcSec  issued  SOP  98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use. SOP 98-1 requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase
of internal-use  software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful
life of the software.  SOP 98-1 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. The adoption of SOP 98-1 did not
have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations.

     In  June of  1998,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  133,   "Accounting   for  Derivative   Instruments  and  Hedging
Activities," which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments,  and for hedging  activities.  It requires that an entity recognize
all  derivatives  as either assets or  liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure those  instruments  at fair value.  Management  has not yet
evaluated the effects of this change on its operations.

     In December 1998,  the Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee  (AcSEC)
released  Statement of Position  98-9,  or SOP 98-9,  Modification  of SOP 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition," with respect to certain  transactions.  SOP 98-9
amends SOP 97-2 to require that an entity recognize revenue for multiple element
arrangements by means of the "residual method" when (1) there is vendor-specific
objective  evidence  (VSOE) of the fair values of all the  undelivered  elements
that are not accounted for by means of long-term contract  accounting,  (2) VSOE
of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements,  and (3)
all revenue  recognition  criteria of SOP 97-2 (other than the  requirement  for
VSOE of the fair value of each delivered element) are satisfied.

     The  provisions of SOP 98-9 that extend the deferral of certain  paragraphs
of SOP 97-2 became effective December 15, 1998. These paragraphs of SOP 97-2 and
SOP 98-9 will be  effective  for  transactions  that are entered  into in fiscal
years beginning after March 15, 1999. Retroactive application is prohibited.  We
have  evaluated the  requirements  of SOP 98-9 and do not believe it will have a
material impact on our current revenue recognition policies.

     In July 1999, the FASB issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards
No. 137, or SFAS No. 137,  Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities - Deferral of the  Effective  Date of FASB No. 133. SFAS 137 deferred
the effective  date of SFAS 133 until the first fiscal quarter  beginning  after
June 15, 2000.

    In December  1999,  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin  No.  101 (SAB  101),  "Revenue  Recognition  in  Financial
Statements."  SAB 101 provides  guidance for revenue  recognition  under certain


                                       33
<PAGE>


circumstances.  We  are  currently  evaluating  the  impact  of  SAB  101 on its
financial  statements and related  disclosures.  The accounting and  disclosures
prescribed by SAB 101 will be effective  for our fiscal year ended  December 31,
2000.

2.  ACQUISITIONS

     In February 1998, we issued 750,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for
all of the outstanding shares of MicroEdge. MicroEdge is the leading provider of
software products to foundations, corporations and other organizations to manage
their grant-making activities.  This business combination was accounted for as a
pooling of interests, and the results of operations of MicroEdge are included in
our financial statements beginning January 1, 1998. The results of operations as
well as the assets and  liabilities  of MicroEdge,  in prior  periods,  were not
material  to our  consolidated  results of  operations  or  financial  position.
Accordingly,  we did not restate our financial  statements  for periods prior to
January 1, 1998.

     In May 1998, we issued 510,000 shares of Common Stock for certain assets of
the Grants Management Division of Blackbaud,  Inc. This acquisition combines the
grants management product line of Blackbaud with MicroEdge. This transaction was
accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  are included in our
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. We incurred a charge for
in-process  research  and  development  and other  expenses  of $5.4  million in
connection with this  transaction.  We believe that the technology  acquired had
not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative future use. Other
intangibles  of $2.0 million were recorded in connection  with this  acquisition
and are being amortized over a period of 5 years.

     In November  1998,  we issued  45,000  shares of Common Stock and paid $4.1
million  in  exchange  for all the  outstanding  shares  of Hub  Data,  Inc.,  a
distributor  of  consolidated  securities  information  and  data to  investment
management  organizations.  Hub Data is located in  Cambridge,  MA and  delivers
services to over 240 institutional  investment firms. This business  combination
was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of operations  for Hub Data are
included in our  financial  statements  beginning on the  acquisition  date.  We
incurred a charge  relating  to  in-process  research  and  development  of $3.0
million in  connection  with this  transaction.  We believe that the  technology
acquired had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. As a result of net  liabilities  assumed and  acquisition  expenses of $1.6
million,  goodwill  of  $3.2  million  was  recorded  in  connection  with  this
transaction and is being amortized over a 7 year period.

     In November  1998,  we paid AUS  $583,000  (approximately  US  $370,000) in
exchange for all the outstanding shares of Portfolio  Management  Systems,  Pty.
Ltd., a distributor of Advent products in Australia.  This business  combination
was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  are included in
our financial  statements  beginning on the acquisition  date. This  acquisition
provides an  international  channel for sale of our products and services.  As a
result of net  liabilities  assumed and  acquisition  expenses of $2.0  million,
goodwill of $2.4 million was recorded in connection with this transaction and is
being  amortized over a period of 10 years.  Subsequent to the  acquisition,  we
changed the name of this subsidiary to Advent Australia.

5. COMMITMENTS

     We lease office space and equipment  under  noncancelable  operating  lease
agreements,  which expire at various  dates  through June 2010.  Some  operating
leases  contain  escalation  provisions  for  adjustments  in the consumer price
index.  We are responsible for  maintenance,  insurance,  and property taxes and
have five-year extension options on our primary facility leases.  Future minimum
payments under the  noncancelable  operating  leases consist of the following at
December 31, 1999 (in thousands):

            2000                    $ 5,341

Rent expense for 1999, 1998, and 1997 was approximately $3,948,000,  $2,494,000,
and $1,484,000, respectively.

6.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     401(k) Plan

     We  have  a  401(k)  deferred  savings  plan  covering   substantially  all
employees. Employee contributions,  limited to 15% of compensation,  are matched
50% by us, up to a maximum of $500 per employee per year. Matching contributions
by us in 1999, 1998 and 1997 were approximately $157,000, $117,000 and $103,000,
respectively.  In addition to the employer  matching  contribution,  we may make
profit sharing  contributions  at the  discretion of the Board of Directors.  We
made profit  sharing  contributions  of  approximately  $218,000,  $143,000  and
$121,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

     1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     All individuals  employed by us are eligible to participate in the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan  (Purchase  Plan) if they are employed by us for at least 20
hours per week and at least five  months per year.  The  Purchase  Plan  permits
eligible  employees to purchase our Common Stock through payroll deductions at a
price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing  sale price for our Common  Stock
reported  on the Nasdaq  National  Market at the  beginning  and the end of each
six-month offering period. In any calendar year, eligible employees can withhold
up to 10% of their salary and certain variable compensation.  A total of 900,000
shares of Common Stock have been  reserved for issuance  under the Purchase Plan
of which approximately 489,000 shares have been issued. Approximately,  102,000,
114,000 and 114,000 shares were sold through the Purchase Plan in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively.

SECONDARY OFFERING

     In June 1999,  we  completed  a  secondary  public  offering of 3.9 million
shares of Common  Stock at an offering  price of $20.688  per share.  Of the 3.9
million  shares of Common Stock  offered,  300,000 shares were sold by a selling
stockholder. The net proceeds of the offering to Advent were $70.2 million.

STOCK SPLITS

     Our Board of Directors  approved a three-for-two  split of our Common Stock
in July 1999. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend.  Stockholders of
record as of the close of business  on July 30,  1999 were issued a  certificate
representing  one  additional  Common Share for every two shares of Common Stock
held on the record date. These certificates were distributed on August 16, 1999.
This stock split increased the number of shares  outstanding from  approximately
9.6 million shares to approximately 14.4 million shares.

     Our Board of Directors  approved a two-for-one split of our Common Stock in
February 2000. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend. Stockholders of
record  as of the  close  of  business  on  February  28,  2000  were  issued  a
certificate  representing  one additional  Common Share for each share of Common
Stock held on the record date. These  certificates were distributed on March 13,
2000. The stock split increased the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
from approximately 14.8 million shares to approximately 29.6 million shares.

     All  shares  and per share  data in this Form  10-K have been  adjusted  to
reflect both stock splits.

STOCK OPTIONS

     Under our 1992  Stock  Plan (the  Plan) we may grant  options  to  purchase
Common  Stock to employees  and  consultants.  Options  granted may be incentive
stock options or nonstatutory  stock options and shall be granted at a price not
less than fair market value on the date of grant.  Fair market value (as defined
in the Plan) and the vesting of these  options  shall be determined by the Board
of Directors.  The options  generally vest over 5 years and expire no later than
10 years from the date of grant.  Unvested  options on termination of employment
are canceled and returned to the Plan.

At December 31,  1999,  42,000  options  under the 1998  Nonstatutory  Plan were
exercisable with an aggregate exercise price of $521,000. No options outstanding
at December 31, 1998, under the 1998 Nonstatutory Plan, were exercisable.

     In addition to the Plan and the Nonstatutory  Plan, we have granted options
to purchase Common Stock to employees or consultants under special arrangements.
These  options  have an  exercise  price of $.34 per share.  There were  14,000,
21,000 and 30,000 of these options  outstanding  at December 31, 1999,  1998 and
1997,  respectively.  The change in each period was a result of the  exercise of
7,000,  9,000 and 6,000 options  during 1999,  1998 and 1997  respectively.  The
options outstanding at December 31, 1999 are fully vested.

     Our 1995 Director Option Plan (the Director Plan) provides for the grant of
nonstatutory stock options to our non-employee  directors  (Outside  Directors).
Under the Director Plan, each Outside Director is granted a non-qualified option
to purchase 30,000 shares on the last to occur of the date of  effectiveness  of
the Director  Plan or the date upon which such person  first  becomes a director
with an exercise  price equal to the fair market value of our Common Stock as of
the  date  of  the  grant.  In  subsequent   years,  each  Outside  Director  is
automatically  granted an option to purchase  6,000 shares on December 1 with an
exercise price equal to the fair value of our Common Stock on that date. Options
granted under the Director Plan vest over a five year period and have a ten year
term.

     We  have  adopted  the   disclosure-only   provisions   of  SFAS  No.  123.
Accordingly,  no  compensation  cost has been  recognized  for our stock  option
plans. If compensation  had been determined based on the fair value at the grant
date for awards in 1999,  1998 and 1997  consistent  with the provisions of SFAS
No.  123,  Advent's  net  income  and net  income  per share for the year  ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, would have been as follows:

Such pro forma  disclosures  may not be  representative  of future  compensation
costs  because  options vest over several years and  additional  grants are made
each year.

     The weighted-average  grant-date fair value of options granted were $13.16,
$5.61 and $4.83 per option for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,

     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the   Black-Scholes   valuation  model  with  the  following   weighted  average
assumptions:

                                   1999              1998             1997
                              ---------------   ---------------  ---------------
Risk-free interest rate            5.9%              4.9%             5.99%
Volatility                         58.7              60.4             56.91
Expected life                   5 years           5 years           5 years
Expected dividends                 None              None              None
Average turnover rate                8%                8%                8%

     The  risk-free  interest rate was  calculated in accordance  with the grant
date and expected  life.  Volatility  was based on weekly closing prices for our
Common Stock.  The weighted  average  expected life was calculated  based on the
vesting period and the exercise behavior of the participants.

     The fair  value for the  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  rights  were also
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes  options pricing model with
the following  assumptions for 1999, 1998 and 1997:  risk-free interest rates of
5.9%, 4.9% and 5.99%, respectively;  dividend yield of 0%; volatility factors of
58.7%, 60.4% and 56.91% for 1999, 1998 and 1997,  respectively;  and a six-month
expected  life.  The weighted  average fair value of the ESPP rights  granted in
1999, 1998 and 1997 was $6.52, $3.21 and $2.99, respectively.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Advent Software, Inc.:

     In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  and the
related  consolidated   statements  of  income  and  comprehensive   income,  of
stockholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Advent Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December
31, 1999 and December 31, 1998,  and the results of their  operations  and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in
conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States.
These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's  management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
on our audit.  We conducted our audits of these  statements  in accordance  with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States which require that we
plan and  perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the
financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An  audit  includes
examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  financial   statements,   assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and
significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for the opinion expressed above.

                                 PROXY STATEMENT
                       FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

                               ------------------

                               PROCEDURAL MATTERS

GENERAL

     The enclosed Proxy is solicited on behalf of Advent Software, Inc. (the
"Company") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting")
to be held on Wednesday, May 14, 2003 at 9:00 a.m., local time, and at any
adjournment thereof, for the purposes set forth herein and in the accompanying
Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

     The Annual Meeting will be held at the Company's offices at 303 Second
Street, 10th floor, San Francisco, California 94107. The Company's telephone
number is (415) 543-7696.

     These proxy solicitation materials were mailed on or about April 2, 2003
together with the Company's 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders, to all
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.

RECORD DATE

     Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2003 (the
"Record Date") are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As
of the Record Date, approximately 32 million shares of the Company's common
stock, $.01 par value (the "Common Stock"), were issued and outstanding. For
information regarding security ownership by management and by the beneficial
owners of more than 5% of the Company's Common Stock, see "Beneficial Security
Ownership of Management and Certain Beneficial Owners."

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person
giving it at any time before its use by delivering to the Secretary of the
Company at the Company's corporate offices a written notice of revocation or a
duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the meeting and voting
in person.

VOTING AND SOLICITATION

     Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock on
all matters presented at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders do not have the right
to cumulate their votes in the election of directors.

     The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition,
the Company may reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing
beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation
materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by certain of
the Company's directors, officers and regular employees, without additional
compensation, personally or by telephone, telegram, letter, electronic mail, or
facsimile.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS; BROKER NON-VOTES

     The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the
shares entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting is necessary to constitute a
quorum at the Annual Meeting. A plurality of the votes duly cast is required for
the election of directors. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes duly
cast is required to approve the share increase for the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan and to ratify the appointment of auditors.

     Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, an abstaining
vote and broker "non-vote" are counted as present and entitled to vote and are,
therefore, included for the purposes of determining whether a quorum of shares
is present at a meeting. A plurality of the votes duly cast is required for the
election of directors. A plurality of the votes duly cast means that only
affirmative votes will affect the outcome of the election. Therefore, neither
abstentions nor broker "non-votes" will have any impact on the election of
directors. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes duly cast is required
to approve the amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and to ratify the
appointment of auditors. Abstentions are deemed to be "votes cast" and will have
the effect of votes in opposition of the proposal to ratify the appointment of
auditors and the amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. However, broker
"non-votes" are not deemed to be "votes cast" and therefore are not included in
the tabulation of the voting results on the proposals to ratify the appointment
of auditors or the amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

     A broker "non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial
owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have
discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received
instructions from the beneficial owner.

DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Any proposal of a shareholder of Advent which is intended to be presented
by such shareholder at Advent's Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2004 must be
received by Advent no later than December 3, 2003 in order for such proposal to
be considered for inclusion in Advent's proxy statement and form of proxy
relating to such meeting. The attached proxy card grants the persons named as
proxies discretionary authority to vote on any matter raised at the Annual
Meeting that is not included in this Proxy Statement. If a shareholder intends
to present a proposal at Advent's Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2003, and
the shareholder does not give appropriate notice to Advent on or before March
30, 2003 the persons named as proxies may use their discretionary voting
authority to vote on the proposal.

                                 PROPOSAL NO. 1

                              ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

GENERAL
The Company's Board is currently composed of seven members. Frank H. Robinson, a
director of the Company since 1985, is not standing for re-election to the Board
and his term as director will cease as of the date of the Annual Meeting. In
connection with Mr. Robinson's retirement, the Board adopted a resolution,
effective as of the date of the Annual Meeting, to decrease the size of the
Board to six members, as authorized under the Company's Bylaws.

NOMINEES

     A Board of six directors is to be elected at the Annual Meeting. Unless
otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them
for the Company's six nominees named below. In the event that any nominee of the
Company is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual
Meeting, the proxies will be voted for any nominee who shall be designated by
the present Board of Directors to fill the vacancy. It is not expected that any
nominee will be unable or will decline to serve as a director. The term of
office of each person elected as a director will continue until the next Annual
Meeting of Stockholders or until a successor has been elected and qualified.

BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES

     The Board of Directors held a total of six meetings (including regularly
scheduled and special meetings) during fiscal 2002 and acted three times by
unanimous written consent. No incumbent director during the last fiscal year,
while a member of the Board of Directors, attended fewer than 75% of (i) the
total number of meetings of the Board of Directors or (ii) the total number of
meetings held by all committees on which such director served.

     The Board of Directors of the Company has three standing committees: an
Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Corporate Governance and
Nominating Committee.

     The Audit Committee, which currently consists of Messrs. Van Auken, Zuendt
and Zweben, is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in monitoring
(i) the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, (ii) the
compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements and (iii) the
independence and performance of the Company's external auditors. The Audit
Committee held five meetings during fiscal 2002.

     The Compensation Committee, which currently consists of Messrs. Robinson
and Van Auken, is responsible for (i) reviewing and approving the compensation
and benefits for the Company's officers and other employees, (ii) administering
the Company's stock purchase and stock option plans, and (iii) making
recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding such matters. The
Compensation Committee held one meeting during fiscal 2002.

     The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee currently consists of
Messrs. Robinson, Zuendt, Van Auken and Zweben and Ms. Carlitz. This committee,
previously named the Nominating Committee, is responsible for the development of
general criteria regarding the qualifications and selection of board members and
recommending candidates for election to the Board. The Nominating Committee held
one meeting during Fiscal 2002. The current Nominating and Governance Committee
has added the responsibilities of developing overall governance guidelines,
overseeing the performance and compensation of the Board and reviewing and
making recommendations regarding the composition and mandate of Board
committees.

     COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive additional
compensation for their services as directors of the Company. However,
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors receive an annual cash retainer of
$5,000 and $1,250 for in person attendance at each meeting of the Board of
Directors.

     In addition, nonemployee directors participate in the Company's 1995
Director Option Plan (the "Director Plan"). The Director Plan was approved by
the Board in October 1995 and was ratified by stockholders in November 1995, at
which time a total of 225,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance
thereunder. The Director Plan was amended in May 2000 to provide for an
additional 200,000 shares of Common stock to be reserved for issuance
thereunder. As of February 28, 2003, there were 243,000 options outstanding
under the Director Plan. The Director Plan became effective on the date of the
Company's initial public offering on November 15, 1995, and is currently
administered by the Board of Directors. Under the Director Plan, each
nonemployee director is automatically granted a non-qualified option to purchase
30,000 shares on the date upon which such person first becomes a director (the
"Initial Option") with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the
Company's Common Stock as of the date of grant. Thereafter, each nonemployee
director is automatically granted an option to purchase 6,000 shares of Common
Stock on December 1st of each year, except in the year the

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

Director Plan was adopted (a "Subsequent Option"), provided he or she has served
as a director for at least six months as of such date.

     Options granted under the Director Plan have a term of ten years unless
terminated sooner upon termination of the optionee's status as a director or
otherwise pursuant to the Director Plan. Such options are transferable by the
optionee only in certain limited circumstances and each option is exercisable
during the lifetime of the director only by such director or a permitted
transferee. Initial Options granted under the Director Plan vest as to one-fifth
(1/5) of the shares on the first anniversary date of grant and, as to the
remaining shares, ratably each month over the ensuing four years. Subsequent
Options begin to vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant and vest
ratably each month over the next 12-month period. The Director Plan is designed
to work automatically, without administration; however, to the extent
administration is necessary, the Director Plan has been structured so that
options granted to nonemployee directors who administer the Company's other
employee benefit plans shall qualify as transactions exempt from Section 16(b)
of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"),
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder.

REQUIRED VOTE

     The six nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the
shares present or represented and entitled to be voted for them shall be elected
as directors, whether or not such affirmative votes constitute a majority of the
shares voted. Votes withheld from any director are counted for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business,
but they have no legal effect under Delaware law.

          MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE NOMINEES LISTED ABOVE


                                 PROPOSAL NO. 2

                     APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S
                        1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN


Proposal

     At the Annual Meeting the stockholders are being requested to approve an
amendment to Advent's 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan") to
increase the number of shares reserved for issuance thereunder by 600,000
shares, for an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares having been reserved for issuance
thereunder. As of December 31, 2002, an aggregate of 104,000 shares were
available for issuance under the Purchase Plan (without giving effect to the
proposed amendment). The amendment to increase the number of shares reserved
under the Purchase Plan is proposed in order to allow individuals employed by
the Company to continue to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company
through convenient payroll deductions. The Company believes that allowing
employees to continue to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock through
the Purchase Plan motivates high-levels of performance and provides an effective
means of encouraging employee commitment to the success of the Company. The
Company believes that this policy is of great value in recruiting and retaining
new employees and allowing existing employees to participate in the success of
the Company. The Board of Directors believes that the ability to grant
participation in the Purchase Plan will be important to the future success of
the Company by allowing it to accomplish these objectives.

Summary of the Purchase Plan

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

GENERAL.

     Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by our Board of Directors in
October 1995, and subsequently ratified by the stockholders in November 1995.
The purpose of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is to provide employees with an
opportunity to purchase our common stock through accumulated payroll deductions.
Approximately 495 employees currently are participating in the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.

ADMINISTRATION.

     Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan may be administered by the Board of
Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors. All questions of
interpretation or application of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are determined
by our Board of Directors or its appointed committee, and its decisions are
final and binding upon all participants.

ELIGIBILITY.

     Each of our employees or the employees of our designated subsidiaries is
eligible to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan; except that no
employee shall be granted an option under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (i)
to the extent that, immediately after the grant, such employee would own 5% of
either the voting power or value of our stock or any of our subsidiaries, or
(ii) to the extent that his or her rights to purchase stock under all of our
employee stock purchase plans or those of our subsidiaries accrues at a rate
which exceeds $25,000 worth of stock (determined at the fair market value of the
shares at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year.

OFFERING PERIOD.

     Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan has consecutive and overlapping
twenty-four month offering periods that usually begin every six months. Each
twenty-four month offering period includes four six-month purchase periods,
during which payroll deductions are accumulated and, at the end of which, shares
of our common stock are purchased with a participant's accumulated payroll
deductions. Our Board of Directors has the power to change the duration of
future offering periods if such change is announced at least five days prior to
the scheduled beginning of the first Offering Period to be affected thereafter.
To participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, an eligible employee must
authorize payroll deductions pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Such
payroll deductions may not exceed 10% of a participant's compensation during the
offering period. At the beginning of each offering period, each participant
automatically is granted an option to purchase shares of our common stock. The
option expires at the end of the offering period or upon termination of
employment, whichever is earlier, but is exercised at the end of each purchase
period to the extent of the payroll deductions accumulated during such purchase
period.

PURCHASE PRICE.

     Shares of our common stock may be purchased under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan at a purchase price not less than 85% of the lesser of the fair
market value of our common stock on (i) the first day of the offering period or
(ii) the last day of the purchase period. The fair market value of our common
stock on any relevant date will be the closing price per share as reported on
the Nasdaq National Market, or the mean of the closing bid and asked prices, if
no sales were reported, as quoted on such exchange or reported in THE WALL
STREET JOURNAL. The number of shares of our common stock a participant purchases
in each offering period is determined by dividing the total amount of payroll
deductions withheld from the participant's compensation prior to the last day of
the purchase period by the purchase price.

PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE; PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS.

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

     The purchase price of the shares is accumulated by payroll deductions
throughout each purchase period. The number of shares of our common stock a
participant may purchase in each purchase period during an offering period is
determined by dividing the total amount of payroll deductions withheld from the
participant's compensation during that purchase period by the purchase price;
provided, however, that a participant may not purchase more than a number of
shares determined by dividing $12,500 by the fair market value of a share of the
Company's common stock on the enrollment date during any given purchase period.

WITHDRAWAL.

     Generally, a participant may withdraw from an offering period at any time
by written notice without affecting his or her eligibility to participate in
future offering periods. However, once a participant withdraws from a particular
offering period, that participant may not participate again in the same offering
period. To participate in a subsequent offering period, the participant must
deliver to us a new subscription agreement.

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

     Upon termination of a participant's employment for any reason, including
disability or death, his or her option and participation in the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan will immediately cease. The payroll deductions credited to the
participant's account (to the extent not used to make a purchase of our common
stock) will be returned to him or her or, in the case of death, to the person or
persons entitled thereto as provided in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

ADJUSTMENTS; MERGER OR CHANGE OF CONTROL.

     ADJUSTMENTS. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend or other
change in our capital structure, appropriate adjustments will be made in the
number, kind and purchase price of the shares available for purchase under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

     MERGER OR CHANGE OF CONTROL. In the event of any merger or "change of
control," as defined in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, each option under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be
substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such
successor corporation. In the event the successor corporation refuses to assume
or substitute for the options, or if the Board of Directors determines otherwise
to do so, the Board of Directors shall shorten any purchase periods and offering
periods then in progress by setting a new exercise date and any offering periods
shall end on the new exercise date.

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.

     Our Board of Directors may at any time and for any reason terminate or
amend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. No amendment shall be effective unless
it is approved by the holders of a majority of the votes cast at a duly held
stockholders' meeting, if such amendment would require stockholder approval in
order to comply with Rule 16b-3 or Section 423 of the Code.

PLAN PARTICIPATION

     Given that the number of shares that may be purchased under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan is determined, in part, on the stock market's value on the
first and last day of the enrollment period and given that participation in the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan is voluntary on the part of employees, the actual
number of shares that may be purchased by any individual is not determinable.
During fiscal 2002, the people named in our Summary Compensation Table purchased
shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan as follows: Lily Chang - 571
shares and Dan Nye - 688 shares. During fiscal 2002, all current executive
officers as a group and all other employees as a group purchased 1,259 and
163,216 shares, respectively, under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

                                      -8-

Directors who are not employees of the Company are not eligible to participate
in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION.

     The following brief summary of the effect of federal income taxation upon
the participant and us with respect to the shares purchased under the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan does not purport to be complete, and does not discuss the
tax consequences of a participant's death or the income tax laws of any state or
foreign country in which the participant may reside.

     The Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and the right of participants to make
purchases thereunder, is intended to qualify under the provisions of Sections
421 and 423 of the Code. Under these provisions, no income will be taxable to a
participant until the shares purchased under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
are sold or otherwise disposed of. Upon sale or other disposition of the shares,
the participant will generally be subject to tax in an amount that depends upon
the holding period. If the shares are sold or otherwise disposed of more than
two years from the first day of the applicable offering period and one year from
the applicable date of purchase, the participant will recognize ordinary income
measured as the lesser of (a) the excess of the fair market value of the shares
at the time of such sale or disposition over the purchase price, or (b) an
amount equal to 15% of the fair market value of the shares as of the first day
of the applicable offering period. Any additional gain will be treated as
long-term capital gain. If the shares are sold or otherwise disposed of before
the expiration of these holding periods, the participant will recognize ordinary
income generally measured as the excess of the fair market value of the shares
on the date the shares are purchased over the purchase price. Any additional
gain or loss on such sale or disposition will be long-term or short-term capital
gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held from the date of
purchase. We generally are not entitled to a deduction for amounts taxed as
ordinary income or capital gain to a participant except to the extent of
ordinary income recognized by participants upon a sale or disposition of shares
prior to the expiration of the holding periods described above.

Required Vote

     The affirmative vote of the holders in majority of the Common Stock
presented or represented at the Annual Meeting is required to approve and ratify
the amendment to the Purchase Plan.


THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT OF THE PURCHASE
PLAN. THE EFFECT OF AN ABSTENTION IS THE SAME AS A VOTE AGAINST THE AMENDMENT OF
THE OPTION PLAN.


                                 PROPOSAL NO. 3

             RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

     The Board of Directors has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
accountants, to audit the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2003. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the
Company's financial statements since 1989. A representative of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is expected to be present at the meeting and will
have the opportunity to make a statement, and is expected to be available to
respond to appropriate questions.

        FEES TO ACCOUNTANTS FOR SERVICES RENDERED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2002

AUDIT FEES:
Audit fees billed to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the
Company's 2002 fiscal year for the audit of the Company's annual financial
statements incorporated by reference on Form 10-K and the review of the
Company's financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q totaled $206,692.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES:
The Company did not engage PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to provide advice to the
Company regarding financial information systems design and implementation during
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002.

ALL OTHER FEES:
Fees billed to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the Company's
2002 fiscal year for all other non-audit services rendered to the Company,
including fees related to services performed in connection with the Company's
tax related services and acquisitions totaled $655,153.


REQUIRED VOTE

     Stockholder ratification of the selection of PricewatehouseCoopers LLP as
the Company's independent public accountants is not required by the Company's
Bylaws, or other applicable legal requirement. However, as a matter of good
corporate practice, the Board of Directors has conditioned its appointment of
the Company's independent accountants upon the receipt of the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shares represented, in person or by proxy, and voting at
the Annual Meeting, which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a
majority of the required quorum. In the event that the stockholders do not
approve the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the appointment of the
independent accountants will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee and the
Board of Directors. Even if the selection is ratified, the Board at its
discretion and at the direction of the Audit Committee may direct the
appointment of a different independent accounting firm at any time during the
year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders.

       THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE
       RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AS
     INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2003.

     as to which the individual has sole or shared voting power or investment
     power and also any shares which the individual has the right to acquire

                COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act ("Section 16(a)") requires the Company's
officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a
registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of
ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or Form 5 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Such officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders
are also required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all such
forms that they file.

     Other than as provided in this Proxy Statement, based solely on its review
of the copies of such forms received by the Company, or written representations
from certain reporting persons that all Forms 5 required for such persons were
filed, the Company believes that during fiscal 2002 all Section 16(a) filing
requirements applicable to its officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders
were complied with, except that Stephanie DiMarco filed one Form 4 late.

           COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     The Company's Compensation Committee was formed in October 1995 and is
currently composed of Messrs. Robinson and Van Auken. No interlocking
relationship exists between any member of the Company's Board of Directors or
Compensation Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation
committee of any other Company, nor has any such interlocking relationship
existed in the past. No member of the Compensation Committee is or was formerly
an officer or an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries.

     The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its
directors and officers. Such agreements require the Company to indemnify such
individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law.

     In April 1997 the Board of Directors of the Company approved and issued a
$200,000 loan to Peter Caswell, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director
of the Company, secured by Mr. Caswell's stock and options in the Company. The
loan was due April 2001, or upon termination of Mr. Caswell's employment with
the Company if earlier, and accrued interest at an annual rate of 8%. The
largest amount outstanding in 2002 was $49,252, consisting of accrued interest.
In February 2002, the Board forgave the remaining amount outstanding based upon
Mr. Caswell's meeting certain performance goals.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had a loan outstanding in the principle amount
of $70,000 to Mr. Geraci who is an executive officer of the Company. Mr.
Geraci's loan was entered into on two dates, May 2001 for $35,000 and March
2002, for $35,000, both for general purposes, and has no specified due date.
Interest on Mr. Geraci's loans are

(1)   All options in this table were granted under either the 1992 Stock Option
      Plan or its successor plan, the 2002 Stock Option Plan and have exercise
      prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. All such
      options have ten-year terms and vest monthly over a five-year period.
(2)   The Company granted options to purchase 899,163 shares of Common Stock to
      employees in fiscal 2002.
(3)   Options may terminate before their expiration upon the termination of
      optionee's status as an employee or consultant, the optionee's death or an
      acquisition of the Company.
(4)   Potential realizable value assumes that the stock price increases from the
      exercise price from the date of grant until the end of the option term (10
      years) at the annual rate specified (5% and 10%). Annual compounding
      results in total appreciation of approximately 62.9% (at 5% per year) and
      159.4% (at 10% per year). The assumed annual rates of appreciation are
      specified in SEC rules and do not represent the Company's estimate or
      projection of future stock price growth. The Company does not necessarily
      agree that this method can properly determine the value of an option .

     Our Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, which is not subject to shareholder
approval, was adopted in 1998. This plan permits the grant of options to
purchase up to 300,000 shares to be granted to eligible employees. Officers and
members of the Board of Directors are not eligible to participate in this plan.
The plan is intended to help the Company attract and retain outstanding
individuals in order to promote the Company's success. Only nonstatutory stock
options may be granted under the plan (that is, options that do not entitle the
optionee to special U.S. income tax treatment). The plan is administered by the
Board of Directors. For example, the Board of Directors selects the individuals
to whom options will be granted and determines the terms and conditions of the
options. This includes the number of shares covered by each option, its exercise
price, any conditions to exercise and the term of the option. Our Board of
Directors generally is authorized to amend or terminate the plan, but no
amendment or termination of the plan may adversely affect any option previously
granted under the plan without the written consent of the participant. See Note
9 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in the Company's
Annual Report to Shareholders for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2002, for a
further description of the terms of the plan.

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee")
consists of directors Frank H. Robinson and Wendell G. Van Auken, neither of
whom is an employee or officer of the Company. The Committee sets policy and
administers the Company's cash and equity incentive programs for the purpose of
attracting and retaining highly skilled executives who will promote the
Company's business goals and build long-term stockholder value. The Committee is
also responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of
Directors regarding all forms of compensation to be provided to the executive
officers and directors of the Company, including stock compensation and loans,
and all bonus and stock compensation to all employees.

     To the extent appropriate, the Company intends to take the necessary steps
to conform its compensation practices to comply with the $1 million compensation
deduction cap under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.

COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND POLICIES

     The policy of the Committee is to attract and retain key personnel through
the payment of competitive base salaries and to encourage and reward performance
through bonuses and stock ownership. The Committee's objectives are to:

  o  ensure that the executive team has clear goals and accountability with
     respect to corporate performance;

  o  establish pay opportunities that are competitive based on prevailing
     practices for the industry, the stage of growth, and the labor markets in
     which the Company operates;

  o  independently assess operating results on a regular basis in light of
     expected Company performance; and

  o  align pay incentives with the long-term interests of the Company's
     stockholders.

ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION

     Compensation for officers and key employees includes both cash and equity
elements.

     Cash compensation consists of base salary, which is determined by the level
of responsibility, expertise and experience of the employee, and competitive
conditions in the industry. The Committee believes that the salaries of its
officers fall within the software industry norm. In addition, cash bonuses may
be awarded to officers and other key employees. Compensation of sales personnel
also includes sales commissions tied to annual and quarterly targets.

     Ownership of the Company's Common Stock is a key element of executive
compensation. Officers and other employees of the Company are eligible to
participate in the 2002 Stock Plan, which was adopted in 2002, and the 1995
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan"), which was adopted prior to
the Company's initial public offering in November 1995, (collectively with the
2002 Stock Plan, the "Option Plans"). The Option Plans permit the Board of
Directors or the Committee to grant stock options to employees on such terms as
the Board or the Committee may determine. The Committee has the sole authority
to grant stock options to executive officers of the Company and currently
administers stock option grants to employees. In determining the size of a stock
option grant to a new officer or other key employee, the Committee takes into
account equity participation by comparable employees within the Company,
external competitive circumstances and other relevant factors. Additional
options may be granted to current employees to reward exceptional performance or
to provide additional unvested equity incentives. The Purchase Plan permits
employees to acquire Common Stock of the Company through payroll


                                      -17-

deductions and promotes broad-based equity participation throughout the Company.
The Committee believes that such stock plans align the interests of the
employees with the long-term interests of the stockholders.

     The Company also maintains a 401(k) Plan to provide retirement benefits
through tax deferred salary deductions for all its employees. Employee
contributions, limited to 15% of compensation up to $11,000, are matched 50% by
the Company, up to 6% of employee compensation. In addition to the employer
matching contribution, Advent may make a profit sharing contribution to the
401(k) Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

     In October 2002, the Board approved a voluntary stock option exchange
program for the Company's employees (the "Exchange Program") because the Board
determined that existing options no longer had sufficient value to motivate and
retain the Company's employees in the current market environment. Under the
Exchange Program, eligible employees, including Mr. Geraci and Mr. Nye, were
given the opportunity to cancel outstanding options to purchase the Company's
Common Stock that were previously granted to them in exchange for a new
non-qualified stock option grant of the Company's Common Stock to be granted at
least six months and one day from the cancellation date of the exchanged
options. The new options will entitle an optionee to purchase 0.80 shares of
Advent Common Stock for each share of Advent Common Stock underlying the
exchanged options. No members of the Company's Board of Directors or executive
officers, other than Mr. Geraci and Mr. Nye, were eligible for the Exchange
Program. On or about June 5, 2003, replacement options will be granted to
participating employees under the Exchange Program.

2002 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     Executive compensation for 2002 included base salary, cash and equity-based
incentive compensation and, in the case of sales executives, sales commissions.
Cash incentive compensation is designed to motivate executives to attain
corporate, business unit and individual goals. The Company's policy is to have a
significant portion of an executive's total compensation at risk based on the
Company's overall performance. Executive officers, like other employees, were
eligible for option grants under the Option Plans.


CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

     Compensation for the Chief Executive Officer is determined by a process
similar to that discussed above for executive officers. The Chief Executive
Officer's target base pay level has been analyzed using data for comparable
software companies. Mr. Caswell receives no other material compensation or
benefits not provided to all executive officers, except for the loan previously
referred to under "Certain Transactions."

     The Committee has considered the potential impact of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which limits the tax deductibility of
cash compensation paid to individual executive officers to $1 million per
officer. The cash compensation to be paid to the Company's executive officers in
fiscal 2002 is not expected to exceed the $1 million limit per individual
officer.

             REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining internal controls and for preparing the Company's consolidated
financial statements. The independent accountants are responsible for auditing
the financial statements. It is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to
oversee these activities. It is not the Audit Committee's duty nor their
responsibility to conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. The
Audit Committee consists of three independent directors, Wendell G. Van Auken,
William F. Zuendt and Monte Zweben, appointed by the Board, who, in the opinion
of the Board, meet the independence and experience requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and NASDAQ. The Audit Committee is governed
by a written charter adopted and approved by the Board. A copy of the Audit
Committee Charter, which is effective for the Company's 2003 fiscal year, is
attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A.

The purpose of the Audit Committee shall be to:

  o  Provide oversight of the Company's accounting and financial reporting
     processes and the audit of the financial statements of the Company;

  o  Assist the Board in oversight of (i) the integrity of the Company's
     financial statements, (ii) the Company's compliance with legal and
     regulatory requirements related to financial affairs and reporting, (iii)
     the independent auditor's qualifications, independence and performance, and
     (iv) the Company's internal accounting and financial controls; and

  o  Periodically provide to the Board a summary of its oversight activities and
     recommendations derived therefrom and such additional information and
     materials as it may deem necessary to make the Board aware of significant
     financial matters that require the attention of the Board.


In addition, the Audit Committee will undertake those specific duties and
responsibilities listed in the Audit Committee Charter and such other duties as
the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe.


     The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board that the
Company's financial statements be included in the Company's annual report. In
connection with the audited financial statements contained in the Company's 2002
Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Audit Committee:

  o  discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent
     accountants, those matters PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP communicated to and
     discussed with the Audit Committee under applicable auditing standards,
     including information concerning the scope and results of the audit;

  o  discussed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's independence with
     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and received a letter from
     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP regarding independence as required under
     applicable independence standards for auditors of public companies;

  o  considered whether the provision of non-audit services by
     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is compatible with maintaining it independence;
     and

  o  reviewed and discussed, with Company management and PricewaterhouseCoopers
     LLP, the Company's audited consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2002
     and 2001, and consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income,
     stockholder's equity and cash flows for the three years ended December 31,
     2002.

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

Based on the discussions with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP concerning the audit,
the independence discussions, and the financial statement review, and additional
matters deemed relevant and appropriate by the Audit Committee, the Audit
Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
include these consolidated financial statements.

          concerning the design, implementation and maintenance of the Company's
          system of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting,
          including meeting periodically with the Company's management and the
          independent auditors to review their assessment of the adequacy of
          such controls and to review before release the disclosure regarding
          such system of internal controls required under SEC rules to be

          The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more designated members of
          the Audit Committee the authority to pre-approve audit and permissible

          Directors, and to the extent there are relationships, monitoring and
          investigating them; (iii) discussing with the Company's independent
          auditors the financial statements and audit findings, including any

          Results of Operations," prior to filing the Company's Annual Report on
          Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, respectively, with the
          SEC;

     o    Directing the Company's independent auditors to review before filing
          with the SEC the Company's interim financial statements included in

          its senior financial officers;

     o    Reviewing management's monitoring of compliance with the Foreign
          Corrupt Practices Act;

                        1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

                        (AMENDED EFFECTIVE MAY 14, 2003)


     The following constitute the provisions of the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan of Advent Software, Inc.

     1.   PURPOSE. The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the
Company and its Designated Subsidiaries with an opportunity to purchase Common
Stock of the Company through accumulated payroll deductions. It is the intention
of the Company to have the Plan qualify as an "Employee Stock Purchase Plan"
under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
provisions of the Plan, accordingly, shall be construed so as to extend and
limit participation in a manner consistent with the requirements of that section
of the Code.

     2.   DEFINITIONS.

          (a)  "BOARD" shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.

          (b)  "CODE" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

          (c)  "COMMON STOCK" shall mean the Common Stock of the Company.

          (d)  "COMPANY" shall mean Advent Software, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and any Designated Subsidiary of the Company.

          (e)  "COMPENSATION" shall mean all base straight time gross earnings,
including commissions, but exclusive of payments for overtime, shift premium,

Company for tax purposes whose customary employment with the Company is at least
twenty (20) hours per week and more than five (5) months in any calendar year.
For purposes of the Plan, the employment relationship shall be treated as
continuing intact while the individual is on sick leave or other leave of
absence approved by the Company. Where the period of leave exceeds 90 days and
the individual's right to reemployment is not guaranteed either by statute or by
contract, the employment relationship will be deemed to have terminated on the
91st day of such leave.

exchange or a national market system, including without limitation the Nasdaq
National Market of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
Automated Quotation ("NASDAQ") System, its Fair Market Value shall be the
closing sale price for the Common Stock (or the mean of the closing bid and
asked prices, if no sales were reported), as quoted on such exchange (or the
exchange with the greatest volume of trading in Common Stock) or system on the
date of such determination, as reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or such other
source as the Board deems reliable, or;

               (2)  If the Common Stock is quoted on the NASDAQ System (but not
on the Nasdaq National Market thereof) or is regularly quoted by a recognized
securities dealer but selling prices are not reported, its Fair Market Value
shall be the mean of the closing bid and asked prices for the Common Stock on
the date of such determination, as reported in THE WALL STREET JOURNAL or such
other source as the Board deems reliable, or;

               (3)  In the absence of an established market for the Common
Stock, the Fair Market Value thereof shall be determined in good faith by the
Board.

          (k)  "OFFERING PERIOD" shall mean the period of approximately
twenty-four (24) months during which an option granted pursuant to the Plan may
be exercised, commencing on the first Trading Day on or after September 1 and
March 1 of each year and terminating on the last Trading Day in the periods
ending twenty-four months later. The duration and timing of Offering Periods may

covered by each option under the Plan which have not yet been exercised and the
number of shares of Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under
the Plan but not yet placed under option.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

          (p)  "SUBSIDIARY" shall mean a corporation, domestic or foreign, of
which not less than 50% of the voting shares are held by the Company or a

     3.   ELIGIBILITY.

          (a)  Any Employee (as defined in Section 2(g)), who shall be employed
by the Company on a given Enrollment Date shall be eligible to participate in
the Plan.

          (b)  Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no
Employee shall be granted an option under the Plan (i) if, immediately after the
grant, such Employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to
such Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own capital stock of
the Company and/or hold outstanding options to purchase such stock possessing
five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all
classes of the capital stock of the Company or of any Subsidiary, or (ii) which
permits his or her rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase
plans of the Company and its subsidiaries to accrue at a rate which exceeds
twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) worth of stock (determined at the fair
market value of the shares at the time such option is granted) for each calendar
year in which such option is outstanding at any time.

     4.   OFFERING PERIODS. The Plan shall be implemented by consecutive,
overlapping Offering Periods with a new Offering Period commencing on the first
Trading Day on or after September 1 and March 1 each year, or on such other date
as the Board shall determine, and continuing thereafter until terminated in
accordance with Section 19 hereof. The Board shall have the power to change the
duration of Offering Periods (including the commencement dates thereof) with
respect to future offerings without shareholder approval if such change is
announced at least five (5) days prior to the scheduled beginning of the first
Offering Period to be affected thereafter.

     5.   PARTICIPATION.

          (a)  An eligible Employee may become a participant in the Plan by
completing a subscription agreement authorizing payroll deductions in the form
of Exhibit A to this Plan and filing it with the Company's payroll office prior
to the applicable Enrollment Date.

          (b)  Payroll deductions for a participant shall commence on the first
payroll following the Enrollment Date and shall end on the last payroll in the
Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner
terminated by the participant as provided in Section 10 hereof.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

     6.   PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS.

          (a)  At the time a participant files his or her subscription
agreement, he or she shall elect to have payroll deductions made on each pay day
during the Offering Period in an amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the
Compensation which he or she receives on each pay day during the Offering
Period, and the aggregate of such payroll deductions during the Offering Period
shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the participant's Compensation during said
Offering Period.

          (b)  All payroll deductions made for a participant shall be credited
to his or her account under the Plan and will be withheld in whole percentages
only. A participant may not make any additional payments into such account.

          (c)  A participant may discontinue his or her participation in the
Plan as provided in Section 10 hereof, or may increase or decrease the rate of
his or her payroll deductions during the Offering Period by completing or filing
with the Company a new subscription agreement authorizing a change in payroll
deduction rate. The Board may, in its discretion, limit the number of
participation rate changes during any Offering Period. The change in rate shall
be effective with the first full payroll period following five (5) business days
after the Company's receipt of the new subscription agreement unless the Company
elects to process a given change in participation more quickly. A participant's
subscription agreement shall remain in effect for successive Offering Periods
unless terminated as provided in Section 10 hereof.

          (d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply
with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) hereof, a participant's
payroll deductions may be decreased to 0% at such time during any Purchase
Period which is scheduled to end during the current calendar year (the "Current
Purchase Period") that the aggregate of all payroll deductions which were
previously used to purchase stock under the Plan in a prior Purchase Period
which ended during that calendar year plus all payroll deductions accumulated
with respect to the Current Purchase Period equal $21,250. Payroll deductions
shall recommence at the rate provided in such participant's subscription
agreement at the beginning of the first Purchase Period which is scheduled to
end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the participant as
provided in Section 10 hereof.

          (e)  At the time the option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at
the time some or all of the Company's Common Stock issued under the Plan is
disposed of, the participant must make adequate provision for the Company's
federal, state, or other tax withholding obligations, if any, which arise upon
the exercise of the option or the disposition of the Common Stock. At any time,
the Company may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the participant's
compensation the amount necessary for the Company to meet applicable withholding
obligations, including any withholding required to make available to the Company
any tax deductions or benefits attributable to sale or early disposition of
Common Stock by the Employee.

     7.   GRANT OF OPTION. On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, each
eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period shall be granted an
option to purchase on each

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

Exercise Date during such Offering Period (at the applicable Purchase Price) up
to a number of shares of the Company's Common Stock determined by dividing such
Employee's payroll deductions accumulated prior to such Exercise Date and
retained in the Participant's account as of the Exercise Date by the applicable
Purchase Price; provided that in no event shall an Employee be permitted to
purchase during each Purchase Period more than a number of Shares determined by
dividing $12,500 by the Fair Market Value of a share of the Company's Common
Stock on the Enrollment Date, and provided further that such purchase shall be
subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 12 hereof. Exercise of
the option shall occur as provided in Section 8 hereof, unless the participant
has withdrawn pursuant to Section 10 hereof. The Option shall expire on the last
day of the Offering Period.

     8.   EXERCISE OF OPTION. Unless a participant withdraws from the Plan as
provided in Section 10 hereof, his or her option for the purchase of shares will
be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full
shares subject to option shall be purchased for such participant at the
applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated payroll deductions in his or her
account. No fractional shares will be purchased; any payroll deductions
accumulated in a participant's account which are not sufficient to purchase a
full share shall be retained in the participant's account for the subsequent
Purchase Period or Offering Period, subject to earlier withdrawal by the
participant as provided in Section 10 hereof. Any other monies left over in a
participant's account after the Exercise Date shall be returned to the
participant. During a participant's lifetime, a participant's option to purchase
shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her.

     9.   DELIVERY. As promptly as practicable after each Exercise Date on which
a purchase of shares occurs, the Company shall arrange the delivery to each
participant, as appropriate, of a certificate representing the shares purchased
upon exercise of his or her option.

     10.  WITHDRAWAL; TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

          (a)  A participant may withdraw all but not less than all the payroll
deductions credited to his or her account and not yet used to exercise his or
her option under the Plan at any time by giving written notice to the Company in
the form of Exhibit B to this Plan. All of the participant's payroll deductions
credited to his or her account will be paid to such participant promptly after
receipt of notice of withdrawal and such participant's option for the Offering
Period will be automatically terminated, and no further payroll deductions for
the purchase of shares will be made for such Offering Period. If a participant
withdraws from an Offering Period, payroll deductions will not resume at the
beginning of the succeeding Offering Period unless the participant delivers to
the Company a new subscription agreement.

          (b)  Upon a participant's ceasing to be an Employee (as defined in
Section 2(g) hereof), for any reason, he or she will be deemed to have elected
to withdraw from the Plan and the payroll deductions credited to such
participant's account during the Offering Period but not yet used to exercise
the option will be returned to such participant or, in the case of his or her
death, to the

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

person or persons entitled thereto under Section 14 hereof, and such
participant's option will be automatically terminated. The preceding sentence
notwithstanding, a participant who receives payment in lieu of notice of
termination of employment shall be treated as continuing to be an Employee for
the participant's customary number of hours per week of employment during the
period in which the participant is subject to such payment in lieu of notice.

     11.  INTEREST. No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions of a
participant in the Plan.

     12.  STOCK.

          (a)  The maximum number of shares of the Company's Common Stock which
shall be made available for sale under the Plan shall be 1,500,000 shares,
subject to adjustment upon changes in capitalization of the Company as provided
in Section 18 hereof. If, on a given Exercise Date, the number of shares with
respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number of shares then
available under the Plan, the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the
shares remaining available for purchase in as uniform a manner as shall be
practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable.

          (b)  The participant will have no interest or voting right in shares
covered by his option until such option has been exercised.

          (c)  Shares to be delivered to a participant under the Plan will be
registered in the name of the participant or in the name of the participant and
his or her spouse.

     13.  ADMINISTRATION.

          (a)  ADMINISTRATIVE BODY. The Plan shall be administered by the Board
or a committee of members of the Board appointed by the Board. The Board or its
committee shall have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe,
interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to determine eligibility and to
adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan. Every finding, decision and
determination made by the Board or its committee shall, to the full extent
permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties.

          (b)  RULE 16B-3 LIMITATIONS. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Subsection (a) of this Section 13, in the event that Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or
any successor provision ("Rule 16b-3") provides specific requirements for the
administrators of plans of this type, the Plan shall be only administered by
such a body and in such a manner as shall comply with the applicable
requirements of Rule 16b-3. Unless permitted by Rule 16b-3, no discretion
concerning decisions regarding the Plan shall be afforded to any committee or
person that is not "disinterested" as that term is used in Rule 16b-3.

     14.  DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY.

          (a)  A participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who
is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the participant's account under
the Plan in the event of such participant's death subsequent to an Exercise Date
on which the option is exercised but prior to delivery to such participant of
such shares and cash. In addition, a participant may file a written designation
of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the participant's account under
the Plan in the event of such participant's death prior to exercise of the
option. If a participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the
spouse, spousal consent shall be required for such designation to be effective.

          (b)  Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the participant
at any time by written notice. In the event of the death of a participant and in
the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at
the time of such participant's death, the Company shall deliver such shares
and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the participant,
or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of
the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or
cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the
participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company,
then to such other person as the Company may designate.

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

     15.  TRANSFERABILITY. Neither payroll deductions credited to a
participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or
to receive shares under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or
otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and
distribution or as provided in Section 14 hereof) by the participant. Any such
attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without
effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw
funds from an Offering Period in accordance with Section 10 hereof.

     16.  USE OF FUNDS. All payroll deductions received or held by the Company
under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the
Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions.

     17.  REPORTS. Individual accounts will be maintained for each participant
in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to participating Employees at
least annually, which statements will set forth the amounts of payroll
deductions, the Purchase Price, the number of shares purchased and the remaining
cash balance, if any.

     18.  ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION,
MERGER OR ASSET SALE.

          (a)  CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION. Subject to any required action by the
shareholders of the Company, the Reserves as well as the price per share of
Common Stock covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been
exercised shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the
number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse
stock split,

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any
other increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock effected
without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that
conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to
have been "effected without receipt of consideration". Such adjustment shall be
made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding
and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company
of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock
of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made
with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an
option.

          (b)  DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION. In the event of the proposed
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Offering Periods will terminate
immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise
provided by the Board.

          (c)  MERGER OR ASSET SALE. In the event of a proposed sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company
with or into another corporation, each option under the Plan shall be assumed or
an equivalent option shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a
parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless the Board determines,
in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu of such assumption or
substitution, to shorten the Offering Periods then in progress by setting a new
Exercise Date (the "New Exercise Date"). If the Board shortens the Offering
Periods then in progress in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a
merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify each participant in writing, at
least ten (10) business days prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise
Date for his option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that his
option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to
such date he has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 10
hereof. For purposes of this paragraph, an option granted under the Plan shall
be deemed to be assumed if, following the sale of assets or merger, the option
confers the right to purchase, for each share of option stock subject to the
option immediately prior to the sale of assets or merger, the consideration
(whether stock, cash or other securities or property) received in the sale of
assets or merger by holders of Common Stock for each share of Common Stock held
on the effective date of the transaction (and if such holders were offered a
choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock); provided, however, that if
such consideration received in the sale of assets or merger was not solely
common stock of the successor corporation or its parent (as defined in Section
424(e) of the Code), the Board may, with the consent of the successor
corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon exercise of the
option to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent
equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of
Common Stock and the sale of assets or merger.

     19.  AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION.

          (a)  The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time and for any
reason terminate or amend the Plan. Except as provided in Section 18 hereof, no
such termination can

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

affect options previously granted, provided that an Offering Period may be
terminated by the Board of Directors on any Exercise Date if the Board
determines that the termination of the Plan is in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders. Except as provided in Section 18 hereof, no
amendment may make any change in any option theretofore granted which adversely
affects the rights of any participant. To the extent necessary to comply with
Rule 16b-3 or under Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule or provision
or any other applicable law or regulation), the Company shall obtain shareholder
approval in such a manner and to such a degree as required.

          (b)  Without shareholder consent and without regard to whether any
participant rights may be considered to have been "adversely affected," the
Board (or its committee) shall be entitled to change the Offering Periods, limit
the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount withheld during an Offering
Period, establish the exchange ratio applicable to amounts withheld in a
currency other than U.S. dollars, permit payroll withholding in excess of the
amount designated by a participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in
the Company's processing of properly completed withholding elections, establish
reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting
procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of Common Stock
for each participant properly correspond with amounts withheld from the
participant's Compensation, and establish such other limitations or procedures
as the Board (or its committee) determines in its sole discretion advisable
which are consistent with the Plan.

     20.  NOTICES. All notices or other communications by a participant to the
Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly
given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by
the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.

     21.  CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES. Shares shall not be issued with
respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and
delivery of such shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all applicable
provisions of law, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements
of any stock exchange upon which the shares may then be listed, and shall be
further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such
compliance.

          As a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may require
the person exercising such option to represent and warrant at the time of any
such exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and
without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the
opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of
the aforementioned applicable provisions of law.

     22.  TERM OF PLAN. The Plan shall become effective upon the earlier to
occur of its adoption by the Board of Directors or its approval by the
shareholders of the Company. It shall continue in effect for a term of ten (10)
years unless sooner terminated under Section 19 hereof.

     23.  AUTOMATIC TRANSFER TO LOW PRICE OFFERING PERIOD. To the extent
permitted by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, if the Fair Market Value of the
Common Stock on any Exercise Date in an Offering Period is lower than the Fair
Market Value of the Common Stock on the Enrollment Date of such Offering Period,
then all participants in such Offering Period shall be automatically withdrawn
from such Offering Period immediately after the exercise of their option on such
Exercise Date and automatically re-enrolled in the immediately following
Offering Period as of the first day thereof.

_____ Original Application                          Enrollment Date: ___________
_____ Change in Payroll Deduction Rate
_____ Change of Beneficiary(ies)


1.   _______________________ hereby elects to participate in the Advent
     Software, Inc. 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Employee Stock
     Purchase Plan") and subscribes to purchase shares of the Company's Common
     Stock in accordance with this Subscription Agreement and the Employee Stock
     Purchase Plan.

2.   I hereby authorize payroll deductions from each paycheck in the amount of
     ____% of my Compensation on each payday (1-10%) during the Offering Period
     in accordance with the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. (Please note that no
     fractional percentages are permitted.)

3.   I understand that said payroll deductions shall be accumulated for the
     purchase of shares of Common Stock at the applicable Purchase Price
     determined in accordance with the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. I
     understand that if I do not withdraw from an Offering Period, any
     accumulated payroll deductions will be used to automatically exercise my
     option.

4.   I have received a copy of the complete " Advent Software, Inc. 1995
     Employee Stock Purchase Plan." I understand that my participation in the
     Employee Stock Purchase Plan is in all respects subject to the terms of the
     Plan. I understand that my ability to exercise the option under this
     Subscription Agreement is subject to obtaining shareholder approval of the
     Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

5.   Shares purchased for me under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan should be
     issued in the name(s) of (Employee or Employee and spouse only): __________
     ________________________________.

6.   I understand that if I dispose of any shares received by me pursuant to the
     Plan within 2 years after the Enrollment Date (the first day of the
     Offering Period during which I purchased such shares) or one year after the
     Exercise Date, I will be treated for federal income tax purposes as having
     received ordinary income at the time of such disposition in an amount equal
     to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time such
     shares were purchased over the price which I paid for the shares. I HEREBY
     AGREE TO NOTIFY THE COMPANY IN WRITING WITHIN

<PAGE>

     30 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF ANY DISPOSITION OF MY SHARES AND I WILL MAKE
     ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS,
     IF ANY, WHICH ARISE UPON THE DISPOSITION OF THE COMMON STOCK. The Company
     may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from my compensation the amount
     necessary to meet any applicable withholding obligation including any
     withholding necessary to make available to the Company any tax deductions
     or benefits attributable to sale or early disposition of Common Stock by
     me. If I dispose of such shares at any time after the expiration of the
     2-year and 1-year holding periods, I understand that I will be treated for
     federal income tax purposes as having received income only at the time of
     such disposition, and that such income will be taxed as ordinary income
     only to the extent of an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the excess of
     the fair market value of the shares at the time of such disposition over
     the purchase price which I paid for the shares, or (2) 15% of the fair
     market value of the shares on the first day of the Offering Period. The
     remainder of the gain, if any, recognized on such disposition will be taxed
     as capital gain.

7.   I hereby agree to be bound by the terms of the Employee Stock Purchase
     Plan. The effectiveness of this Subscription Agreement is dependent upon my
     eligibility to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

8.   In the event of my death, I hereby designate the following as my
     beneficiary(ies) to receive all payments and shares due me under the
     Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

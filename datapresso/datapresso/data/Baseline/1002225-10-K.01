Item 1. BUSINESS

Overview

    Advent  Software,  Inc.  (Advent) is a leading  provider of stand-alone  and
client/server  software  products,  data  interfaces  and related  services that
automate  and  integrate  certain   mission-critical   functions  of  investment
management  organizations.  Advent's  suite of  complementary  products  for the
front,  middle  and  back  office  includes  Axys(TM),  Advent  Partner(TM)  and
Geneva(R),  Advent's  portfolio  accounting and management  systems;  Moxy(R), a
trading and order management  system;  Qube(R),  a client  management system and
Rex(TM),  an automated  transaction and position  reconciliation  system.  These
products address the need to facilitate the management of increasingly large and
complex   information   and  data  flows  both  within   investment   management
organizations  and  between  such  organizations  and  third  parties,  such  as
brokerage firms,  clients,  custodians,  banks,  pricing services and other data
providers.  Advent's  products are designed to reduce client costs,  improve the
accuracy of client information, and generally enable clients to devote more time
to improving the service they provide to their customers rather than focusing on
operational   details.   Advent's   strategy  is  to  develop  long-term  client
relationships and to maintain a high level of lifetime client satisfaction which
Advent  believes will result in additional  recurring  revenues from new product
licenses, renewals of existing maintenance contracts and the introduction of new
data products.

    Advent's clients include many of the world's leading  investment  management
organizations.  These  organizations  vary  significantly in size,  assets under
management  and the  complexity of their  investment  environments.  At present,
Advent has licensed its products to over 4,500  institutions in 22 countries for
use by more than 25,000 concurrent users.

    Advent was  incorporated  in 1983 in California  and  reincorporated  in the
State of Delaware in November 1995.

Industry Background

    The investment  management  business includes a range of organizations  that
manage investment  portfolios,  including investment advisors,  brokerage firms,
banks and hedge funds.  In addition,  corporations,  public funds,  foundations,
universities  and  non-profit  organizations  manage  investment  portfolios and
perform  similar  portfolio  management  functions.   Recently,  the  investment
management  industry has  experienced  significant  growth which, in combination
with other  factors,  has led to  increasing  demand for software  products that
automate,   simplify  and  integrate  functions  within  investment   management
organizations.  This increasing  demand is driven by several industry  dynamics.
Financial assets under management have increased  substantially  during the last
decade.  As the value of total financial  assets under management has increased,
there has been a  substantial  increase in the number of  investment  management
organizations and a steady introduction of increasingly  sophisticated financial
instruments.  As a  result,  investment  managers  are faced  with  increasingly
complicated  portfolio  accounting  and  management   requirements.   Investment
management   organizations  are  subject  to  extensive  and  evolving  industry
standards and government  regulations.  These dynamics have increased the volume
and  complexity  of  information  and data flows  within  investment  management
organizations  and  between  such  organizations  and  third  parties,  such  as
brokerage firms,  clients,  custodians,  banks,  pricing services and other data
providers.  Consequently,   investment  management  organizations  require  more
sophisticated and integrated  software products for their front, middle and back
offices.  In order to operate  efficiently  within this environment,  investment
management  organizations must automate and integrate their mission-critical and
labor-intensive functions,  including (i) investment decision support and client
relationship  management,  (ii) order management and trading and (iii) portfolio
accounting,   performance   measurement,   report   generation  and  compliance.
Investment  management  organizations  historically  have  relied on  internally
developed systems,  timesharing services or simple spreadsheet-based  systems to
manage information flows. Due to inherent  limitations in each of these types of
systems,  investment  management  

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

organizations are demanding highly functional,
easy-to-use,  scalable,  cost-effective and flexible software  applications that
automate and integrate their mission-critical business functions.

Software Products

    Advent offers a suite of stand-alone  and  client/server  software  products
that  automate and  integrate  work and data flows across the front,  middle and
back  offices  within the  investment  management  organization,  as well as the
information  flows between the investment  management  organization and external
parties.  Advent's  products are intended to reduce  client  costs,  improve the
accuracy  of client  information  and  generally  enable  clients to improve the
service  they provide to their  customers  rather than  focusing on  operational
details. Each software product is focused on certain mission-critical  functions
of the front,  middle or back offices of  investment  management  organizations.
Individual  products  are  tailored  to meet the  needs of a  particular  market
segment,  as determined by size,  assets under  management and complexity of the
investment  environment.  In  addition,  Advent  believes  its products are well
suited for the investment  management  functions of corporations,  public funds,
foundations, universities and non-profit organizations.




                              [Chart Appears Here]




Portfolio Accounting and Management

    Advent offers three  portfolio  accounting  and  management  systems,  Axys,
Advent  Partner  and  Geneva,  each  targeted  at a  different  segment  of  the
investment management industry.

                                      -3-

<PAGE>

    Axys,  Advent's  core product,  introduced  in 1993, is a highly  functional
portfolio   accounting  and  management   system  targeted  towards   investment
management  organizations of all sizes. Axys provides  investment  professionals
with  broad  portfolio  accounting   functionality,   timely  decision  support,
sophisticated  performance  measurement  and flexible  reporting.  Specifically,
clients  can  record,  account  for  and  report  on  a  variety  of  investment
instruments, including equities, fixed income, mutual funds and cash. Axys users
gain access on demand to  portfolio  holdings,  asset  allocation,  realized and
unrealized  gains and losses,  actual and  projected  income and other  valuable
data. Portfolio performance can be measured for individual portfolios or related
groups, and for any specified time period.  Investment  professionals can choose
from over 200 pre-defined reports with flexible "as-of" reporting,  which can be
customized as to formats and fonts. Clients can easily generate fully customized
reports with the assistance of the Axys Report Writer.  Clients can also produce
presentation-quality  graphics via an  integrated  link with  Microsoft  Excel's
charting  capability.   In  addition,   Axys  offers  integrated   multicurrency
capabilities  which,  among other things,  allows  reports to be restated in any
currency,  withholding  tax to be  automatically  calculated,  and components of
return  attributable  to market prices versus  currency rate  fluctuations to be
identified.

    Axys also provides  integration with a variety of investment tools and data,
including (i) trade order management via Moxy, (ii) pricing,  corporate actions,
analytics and fundamental  data via interfaces to data vendors,  (iii) automatic
data entry and  reconciliation of trades with interfaces to The Depository Trust
Corporation  ( DTC ),  and to  certain  brokerage  firms  and  custodians,  (iv)
automatic transaction and position  reconciliation through the Internet via Rex,
Advent's  custodial  reconciliation  service  and  software,  and  (v)  Internet
reporting via the Axys WebView service, Advent's Internet reporting service.

    Advent  Partner,  introduced  in  December  1996,  is  a  tax  layering  and
partnership  allocation  solution which  integrates  with Axys.  This product is
specifically  designed for hedge  funds,  venture  funds and limited  investment
partnerships  who face the complex and  time-consuming  task of consistently and
accurately  accounting for and reporting on partnership tax allocation and other
activities. The Windows-based system tracks partner-specific information, layers
realized and unrealized gains,  allocates  performance  incentive fees, provides
on-demand  partner and partnership  reporting on a book or tax allocation  basis
and streamlines the production of partnership tax returns.

    Geneva,  introduced to target  organizations  in 1995 and made  commercially
available in October 1997, is a high-end portfolio management system designed to
meet  the  needs of  large,  global  investment  management  organizations  with
complex,  international  accounting  requirements.  Geneva  offers  feature-rich
global   accounting,   extensive   reporting  and  sophisticated   multicurrency
capabilities.  In addition,  Geneva's highly flexible design allows users to add
newly created financial  instruments and tailor  accounting  treatments to their
specific needs.

Trading and Order Management

    Moxy,  introduced in 1995,  automates and  streamlines the trading and order
management process. Moxy can be integrated with any portfolio accounting system,
facilitates accurate trade order management and preparation,  tracks trade order
status,  automates the allocation of block trades across multiple portfolios and
electronically  interfaces  with Axys to provide an  integrated  solution.  Moxy
supports fixed income, mutual funds, and equity trading and offers multicurrency
capabilities.  Moxy enables  investment  managers to accurately adjust portfolio
holdings,  rebalance  portfolios against models,  interactively assess "what-if"
scenarios  and  automatically  create orders to be executed.  For traders,  Moxy
tracks  cash  and  positions  during  the  trading  day,  enables  the  accurate
preparation of block trades and internal  electronic trade tickets,  facilitates
compliance with investment  restrictions and trading  requirements and minimizes
trading errors. 

                                      -4-

<PAGE>

Moxy also allows traders and others to view the status of orders via  
customizable  screens and maintain an  electronic  audit trail of the trade
process.   Moxy  automates  the  allocation  process  of  partial  and  complete
executions and allows the user to send  allocation  results by fax directly from
the  computer  to  brokers  and banks.  Moxy  allows  clients  using  OASYS,  an
electronic   allocation   system,   to   communicate   allocations   to  brokers
electronically.  In the future, Moxy will have additional  electronic links that
instantly   communicate   trade  and  allocation   information  to  brokers  and
custodians.  Moxy  electronically  posts  allocated  trades into Axys on demand,
eliminating time-consuming and error-prone manual entry.

Client Management

    Qube,  introduced  in 1995,  is  designed to help  securities  professionals
develop  and improve  client  relationships  by  automating  scheduling,  client
communications   and  client  data.   For  example,   Qube  enables   investment
professionals to interactively  screen client  investment  profiles and notes of
conversations  to  identify   appropriate   candidates  for  various  investment
opportunities.  In  addition,  Qube  can be used  to  enhance  direct  marketing
campaigns by matching clients with market opportunities. Qube captures extensive
investment  profile  information,  has  on-line  query  capability,   networking
features and mail merge capabilities and facilitates  information sharing across
professionals  in an office.  Moreover,  Qube is designed to be integrated  with
Axys,  allowing users to provide  accurate and timely  portfolio  information to
clients.

Maintenance Support and Data Interfaces

    Advent  earns  recurring  revenues  by  offering  a  choice  of  maintenance
contracts  and by  providing  proprietary  interfaces  to  external  sources  of
critical data. These interfaces allow clients to (i) download pricing, corporate
actions and other data from third party  vendors  such as  Interactive  Data,  a
wholly owned indirect  subsidiary of Pearson plc  (Interactive  Data),  and (ii)
interface with DTC, certain brokerage firms and custodians for trading activity.
Advent  continually  analyzes the ongoing external data needs of its clients and
expects to offer new data products in the future.  Many of Advent's  clients use
Advent's proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data
from  Interactive  Data.  Interactive  Data pays  Advent a  commission  based on
Interactive Data's revenues from providing such data to Advent's clients.

    Due to the  mission-critical  nature  of  Advent's  products,  many  clients
purchase annual  maintenance  contracts which entitle them to technical  support
and product upgrades as they become available.  Advent continually  upgrades and
enhances its products to respond to changing market needs,  evolving  regulatory
requirements and new technologies.

Internet Initiative

    Advent believes that the Internet can be a low-cost  communications platform
to integrate external information into Advent products, thereby providing Advent
clients  with  straight  through  processing  of business  information.  To take
advantage of the Internet, Advent has launched an Internet Initiative whereby it
is developing services, both announced and unannounced,  to bring Internet-based
products and services to clients. The first of these services, Rex, was launched
during the second quarter of 1997. Rex is an electronic  reconciliation  service
which allows  Advent  clients to automate the tedious and time  consuming  tasks
associated with reconciling positions and transactions across custodians.  Using
the  Internet,   Rex  consolidates   communication   and  information  from  all
participating  custodians,   enabling  Advent  clients  to  quickly  and  easily
reconcile transactions and holdings with a click of the mouse.

    From time to time, as Advent begins development of new products and services
under its Internet  Initiative,  it plans to continue to enter into  development
agreements with information  providers,  clients, or other companies in order to
accelerate the delivery of new products and services.

                                      -5-

<PAGE>

Professional Services

    Professional  services consists of consulting,  systems integration,  custom
programming,  and  training.  To  ensure a  successful  product  implementation,
consultants assist clients with the initial installation of a system,  assist in
the conversion of the client's  historical data and provide ongoing training and
education.  Consulting  services  may be required  for as little as two days for
small  systems or up to many weeks for large  implementations.  Advent  believes
that its  consulting  services  facilitate  a client's  early  success  with its
products,  strengthen  the  relationship  with the client and generate  valuable
feedback for Advent.

    Advent's systems integration services develop new interfaces,  either at the
request of existing clients or external  organizations  such as brokerage firms,
custodians,  DTC, pricing services,  and other data providers.  These interfaces
are designed to provide easier and faster data entry,  automatic  reconciliation
or  confirmations.  These interfaces are licensed as an option which clients can
obtain  when  configuring  the Axys system or later as their  information  needs
change.  In  addition,  Advent  also uses its  systems  integration  services to
develop  interfaces which Advent expects will satisfy  anticipated  needs of its
clients.

    Advent  provides its clients with custom  programming  services  that enable
clients to tailor  end-user  reports to their own  specifications.  Advent  also
provides training sessions to its clients at various sites across the country.

Clients

    Advent's clients vary  significantly in size and assets under management and
include investment advisors,  brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds, corporations,
public funds, universities and non-profit organizations.  At present, Advent has
licensed its products to over 4,500 institutions in 22 countries for use by more
than 25,000 concurrent users.

Sales and Marketing

    Sales

    Advent sells its products and services  through a direct sales  organization
comprised of field sales and  telesales  representatives.  Advent's  field sales
force is organized by geographic region and is primarily responsible for selling
Axys and Moxy to mid-sized and large investment management organizations. Advent
has sales  offices in San  Francisco,  New York and Boston.  Advent's  telesales
organization is primarily  focused on selling Advent's products to existing Axys
clients and small and mid-sized investment  management  organizations.  Advent's
telesales representatives are located in San Francisco.  Advent's sales force is
supported by extensive ongoing product and sales training.

    Marketing

    The marketing department is responsible for assessing market opportunities,
product  planning and management and specific sales support.  In addition to its
traditional marketing functions, the marketing organization is actively involved
in a process called "Market  Validation(SM)," using a system of interaction with
and input from potential and existing clients,  product  development,  sales and
client  services  and  support  departments  to define the scope,  features  and
functionality  of new  products  and  product  upgrades.  In  addition,  product
managers  are  responsible  for all phases of a product  life cycle from product
development through product introduction and beyond. The marketing department is
also responsible for corporate  marketing,  including  generating  client leads,
targeted  direct  mail  campaigns,   seminars,   advertising,  trade  shows  and
conferences and public relations efforts. The marketing department also provides
the sales force with appropriate written and electronic  materials to use during
the sales process.

Product Development

    In recent years, Advent has substantially  increased its product development
expenditures  in order to  accelerate  the  rate of new  product  introductions,
incorporate new technologies  and sustain the quality of its products.  

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

In 1997, 1996, and 1995,  Advent's product  development  expenditures were  
approximately $9.4  million,  $6.7  million  and $4.2  million,  respectively.  
In addition to engineering,  quality assurance and documentation,  Advent's 
product development activities include the identification and validation of 
product specifications.

    Advent's  new  products  and product  upgrades  require  varying  degrees of
development time,  depending upon the complexity of the accounting  requirements
and securities  regulations  which they are intended to address,  as well as the
number and type of features  incorporated.  Advent has primarily relied upon the
internal development of its products.  Advent has in the past acquired,  and may
again in the future  acquire,  additional  technologies  or products  from third
parties or consultants.  Advent intends to continue to support industry standard
operating environments, client/server architectures and network protocols.

    There can be no assurance  that Advent will be  successful  in  developing,
introducing  and marketing new products or product  enhancements on a timely and
cost  effective  basis,  if at  all,  or  that  its  new  products  and  product
enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve
market  acceptance.  Delays in the  commencement of commercial  shipments of new
products or enhancements may result in client  dissatisfaction and delay or loss
of product revenues. If Advent is unable, for technological or other reasons, to
develop and introduce  new products or  enhancements  of existing  products in a
timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client  requirements,
or if new  products or new versions of existing  products do not achieve  market
acceptance,  Advent's business,  operating results and financial condition would
be materially adversely affected.  In addition,  Advent's ability to develop new
products  and  product  enhancements  is  dependent  upon the  products of other
software vendors,  including certain system software vendors,  such as Microsoft
Corporation,  database vendors and development  tool vendors.  In the event that
the products of such vendors have design  defects or flaws,  or if such products
are unexpectedly  delayed in their  introduction,  Advent's business,  operating
results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Software
products as complex as those offered by Advent, particularly Advent's new Geneva
product,  may contain  undetected  defects or errors when first introduced or as
new versions are released.  Although Advent has not experienced material adverse
effects  resulting  from any software  errors,  there can be no assurance  that,
despite  testing by Advent and its clients,  defects or errors will not be found
in new products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of
or delay in market  acceptance,  which could have a material adverse effect upon
Advent's business, operating results and financial condition.

Competition

    The market for investment  management  software is segmented by the relative
size of the organizations that manage investment  portfolios.  In addition,  the
market in each segment is intensely  competitive and highly fragmented,  subject
to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product  introductions and marketing
efforts by industry  participants.  Advent's  competitors  include  providers of
software  and  related  services as well as  providers  of  timeshare  services.
Competitors vary in size, scope of services offered and platforms supported.  In
addition,  Advent competes indirectly with existing and potential clients,  many
of whom develop their own software for their  particular needs and therefore may
be reluctant to license software products offered by independent vendors such as
Advent. With respect to the market for its portfolio accounting products, Advent
currently competes primarily with Shaw Data, a division of SunGard Data Systems,
Inc.,  Thomson  Financial,  a division  of The Thomson  Corporation,  and with a
number  of  other  smaller   companies.   Advent  believes  that  the  principal
competitive  factors  affecting  its  market  include  product  performance  and
functionality,  ease of use,  scalability,  ability to integrate  external  data
sources,  product and company reputation,  client service and support and price.
There can be no  assurance  that  Advent  will be able to  compete  successfully
against current and future  competitors or that  competitive  pressures will not
result in price  reductions,  reduced  operating  margins and the loss of market
share,  any one of which could materially  adversely  affect Advent's  business,
operating results and financial condition.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights

    Advent's  success  is  dependent  in  part on its  ability  to  protect  its
proprietary  technology.  Advent  relies  on  a  combination  of  copyright  and
trademark  laws,  trade secrets,  software  security  measures,  confidentiality
agreements  and license  agreements  to  establish  and protect its  proprietary
rights  and  its  software.  Despite  these  efforts,  it  may be  possible  for
unauthorized  third parties to copy certain portions of Advent's  products or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use proprietary  information of Advent.
Advent  does not have any  patents,  and  existing  copyright  laws  afford only
limited protection.  In addition,  Advent cannot be certain that others will not
develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology,  or that
equivalent  products will not be marketed in competition with Advent's products,
thereby  substantially  reducing  the  value  of  Advent's  proprietary  rights.
Furthermore,  there  can be no  assurance  that any  confidentiality  agreements
between Advent and its employees or any license agreements with its clients will
provide meaningful  protection of Advent's proprietary  information in the event
of any  unauthorized  use or  disclosure  of such  proprietary  information.  In
addition,  the laws of certain  countries  do not protect  Advent's  proprietary
rights to the same  extent  as do the laws of the  United  States.  Accordingly,
there can be no  assurance  that Advent will be able to protect its  proprietary
software against  unauthorized third party copying or use, which could adversely
affect Advent's business, operating results and financial condition.

Employees

    As of December 31, 1997, Advent had 325 full-time employees, including 34 in
sales, 67 in professional services, 19 in marketing,  83 in product development,
68 in client services and support and 54 in finance, administration,  operations
and  general   management.   Advent  believes  that  it  maintains   competitive
compensation,  benefits,  equity  participation and work environment policies to
assist in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Advent's success depends
to a significant  extent upon a limited  number of members of senior  management
and other key employees,  including Stephanie DiMarco,  Advent's Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the service of one or more senior
managers or other employees  could have a material  adverse effect upon Advent's
business,  operating results and financial condition. None of Advent's employees
is represented by a labor union.  Advent has not  experienced any work stoppages
and considers its relations with its employees to be good.

Item 2. PROPERTIES

    Advent leases office space in facilities in San Francisco,  New York and New
Jersey. Advent has three separate leases in San Francisco,  a 33,000 square foot
lease that expires in 1998 with a 1 or 5 year extension  option,  another 23,700
square foot lease in the same building that expires in 2000, and a 16,000 square
foot  lease in an  adjacent  building  that  expires in 2004.  This is  Advent's
principal  executive  office  and  is  where  product  development,   marketing,
technical  support and  production  are located.  Advent  leases three  separate
office  spaces in New York; a 12,100  square foot lease and another 5,300 square
foot lease  expire in 2003 and a 9,800  square  foot lease  expires in 1999.  In
addition,  Advent has a 1000  square  foot lease in New Jersey  that  expires in
2000. Advent believes that its facilities are adequate for its current needs and
that suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on
commercially reasonable terms as needed.

<PAGE>

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

    The  information  required by this Item is  incorporated by reference to the
section entitled  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition
and Results of Operations" in Advent's 1997 Annual Report to Stockholders.

    In addition, Advent operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves
a number of risks,  some of which are beyond  Advent's  control.  The  following
discussion highlights some of these risks.

    Period  to  Period  Fluctuations.  As  Advent's  licenses  into  multi-user
networked  environments  have increased both in individual size and number,  the
timing and size of individual  license  transactions  are becoming  increasingly
important factors in Advent's quarterly operating results.  The sales cycles for
transactions of this size are often lengthy and  unpredictable.  There can be no
assurance  that Advent will be successful in closing large license  transactions
such as  these  on a  timely  basis  or at all.  Accordingly,  if in the  future
revenues from large site licenses  constitute a material portion of Advent's net
revenues,  the timing of such licenses  could cause  additional  variability  in
Advent's quarterly  operating results.  Advent's software products typically are
shipped shortly after receipt of a signed license  agreement and initial payment
and,  consequently,  software  product  backlog at the  beginning of any quarter
typically  represents only a small portion of that quarter's  expected revenues.
Advent's expense levels are based in significant  part on Advent's  expectations
of future revenues and therefore are relatively  fixed in the short term. Due to
the fixed  nature of these  expenses  combined  with the  relatively  high gross
margin   historically   achieved  by  Advent  on  products  and   services,   an
unanticipated  decline in net  revenues in any  particular  quarter is likely to
disproportionately adversely affect operating results.

    Advent  generally has realized lower revenues from license fees in the first
quarter of the year than in the immediately  preceding quarter.  Advent believes
that this has been due primarily to the  concentration by some clients of larger
capital  purchases in the fourth  quarter of the  calendar  year and their lower
purchasing activity during the subsequent first quarter,  compounded by Advent's
annual  incentive  compensation  plans which result in increased  year-end sales
activity.  Furthermore, Advent has often recognized a substantial portion of its
license revenues in the last month of a quarter.

    Due to all of the foregoing  factors,  Advent believes that period to period
comparisons  of its operating  results are not  necessarily  meaningful and that
such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.

    Advent's stock price has fluctuated  significantly  since the initial public
offering in November  1995.  Like many  companies in the technology and emerging
growth sector, Advent's stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations.  If net
revenues  or earnings in any  quarter  fail to meet the  investment  community's
expectations,  there could be an immediate  impact on Advent's  stock price.  In
addition,  the stock price may be affected by broader market trends unrelated to
Advent's performance

    Product  Concentration.  During  1995,  1996  and  1997,  Advent  derived  a
substantial  majority of its net revenues from the licensing of Axys and related
products and services.  In addition,  many of Advent's other  products,  such as
Moxy,  Qube and various data  interfaces,  were designed to operate with Axys to
provide an integrated solution.  As a result, Advent believes that a majority of
its net revenues, at least through 1998, will be dependent upon continued market
acceptance of Axys,  enhancements  or upgrades to Axys and related  products and
services.

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

    Geneva.  In 1995,  Advent  introduced  Geneva to target  organizations  with
complex  international  accounting  and  reporting  requirements,  and, in 1997,
announced  its full  commercial  availability.  To date,  revenues  derived from
licenses of Geneva have not been  material.  Advent is  directing a  significant
amount of its product  development  expenditures to the on-going  development of
Geneva  and  plans to  devote a  significant  amount  of its  future  sales  and
marketing  resources  to Geneva.  Advent has limited  experience  in  developing
products for this market.  Because of such limited client experience,  there can
be no assurance that Geneva will not require substantial  software  enhancements
or modifications to satisfy performance requirements of clients or to fix design
defects or previously undetected errors. Further, there can be no assurance that
Advent will be successful in marketing Geneva.  Advent's failure to successfully
market Geneva could adversely affect Advent's business and operating results.

    Internet Initiative. To take advantage of the Internet,  Advent has launched
an Internet  Initiative  whereby it is developing  services,  both announced and
unannounced, to bring Internet based products and services to clients. The first
of these  services,  Rex, was  launched  during the second  quarter of 1997.  As
Advent  begins  development  of new  products  and  services  under its Internet
Initiative,  it has and will continue to enter into development  agreements with
information  providers,  clients,  or other companies in order to accelerate the
delivery of new products  and  services.  There can be no assurance  that Advent
will be successful in marketing Rex or in developing  other  Internet  services.
Advent's failure to do so could adversely affect Advent's business and operating
results.

    New Products and Product Enhancements. Advent's future success will continue
to depend upon its ability to develop new products that address the future needs
of its  target  markets  and to  respond  to  emerging  industry  standards  and
practices. Delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or
enhancements may result in client  dissatisfaction  and delay or loss of product
revenues.  In  addition,  Advent's  ability to develop new  products and product
enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors, including
certain system software vendors, such as Microsoft Corporation, database vendors
and  development  tool  vendors.  In the event that the products of such vendors
have design defects or flaws,  or if such products are  unexpectedly  delayed in
their introduction, Advent's business, operating results and financial condition
could be materially adversely affected.

    Financial Markets.  The target clients for Advent's products include a range
of  organizations  that  manage  investment  portfolios,   including  investment
advisors,  brokerage firms,  banks and hedge funds. In addition,  Advent targets
corporations, public funds, universities and non-profit organizations which also
manage  investment  portfolios  and have many of the same needs.  The success of
many of Advent's clients is intrinsically  linked to the health of the financial
markets.   Advent   believes   that   demand   for   its   products   could   be
disproportionately  affected  by  fluctuations,   disruptions,   instability  or
downturns in the financial markets which may cause clients and potential clients
to exit the  industry or delay,  cancel or reduce any planned  expenditures  for
investment management systems and software products

    Relationship  with  Interactive  Data. Many of Advent's clients use Advent's
proprietary  interface to  electronically  retrieve  pricing and other data from
Interactive Data. Interactive Data pays Advent a commission based on Interactive
Data's revenues from providing such data to Advent's clients.  Advent's software
products have been  customized to be compatible with  Interactive  Data's system
and such software  would need to be redesigned if  Interactive  Data's  services
were unavailable for any reason.  In the event that Advent's  relationship  with
Interactive Data were terminated or Interactive Data's services were unavailable
to Advent's clients for any reason, replacing these services could be costly and
time consuming.

    Competition.  The market for investment  management software is segmented by
the relative size of the  organizations  that manage investment  portfolios.  In
addition,  the  market in each  segment  is  intensely  competitive  and  highly
fragmented,  subject  to  rapid  change  and  highly  sensitive  to new  product
introductions   and  marketing  efforts  by  industry   participants.   Advent's
competitors  include  providers  of  software  and  related  services as well as
providers of timeshare  services.  

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

Competitors  vary in size,  scope of services offered and platforms  supported. 
In addition,  Advent competes indirectly with existing and  potential  clients, 
many of whom  develop  their own software for their  particular  needs and  
therefore  may be  reluctant  to license  software products  offered  by  
independent  vendors  such as  Advent.  Many of  Advent's competitors have 
longer operating  histories and greater  financial,  technical, sales and 
marketing resources than Advent. There can be no assurance that Advent will be 
able to compete  successfully  against current and future competitors or that  
competitive  pressures  will  not  result  in  price  reductions,  reduced
operating  margins and loss of market share,  any one of which could  materially
adversely affect Advent's business, operating results and financial condition.

                  (iv) such other  information  regarding  each  nominee or each

                  to the proxy rules of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
                  had the nominee been  nominated,  or intended to be nominated,

         2.7      QUORUM

         The  holders  of a  majority  in voting  power of the stock  issued and
outstanding  and entitled to vote thereat,  present in person or  represented by
proxy,  shall  constitute a quorum at all meetings of the  stockholders  for the
transaction  of  business  except as  otherwise  provided  by  statute or by the
certificate  of  incorporation.  If,  however,  such  quorum is not  present  or
represented at any meeting of the stockholders,  then either (i) the chairman of
the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or represented  by proxy,  shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance
with Section 2.8 of these bylaws.

         When a quorum is present at any  meeting,  the vote of the holders of a
majority of the stock having  voting power present in person or  represented  by
proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question
is one upon which, by express  provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or
of the  certificate  of  incorporation  or these  bylaws,  a  different  vote is
required,  in which case such  express  provision  shall  govern and control the
decision of the question.

         If a quorum be  initially  present,  the  stockholders  may continue to
transact business until  adjournment,  notwithstanding  the withdrawal of enough
stockholders  to leave less than a quorum,  if any action taken is approved by a
majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.

         2.8      ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE

         When a meeting is  adjourned  to another  time and place,  unless these
bylaws otherwise  require,  notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if
the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken.  At the adjourned  meeting the  corporation  may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original  meeting.  If the adjournment is
for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the  adjourned  meeting,  a notice of the  adjourned  meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

         2.9      VOTING

         The stockholders  entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall
be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws,
subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law
of  Delaware  (relating  to voting  rights of  fiduciaries,  pledgors  and joint
owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).

         Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation
or these bylaws,  each stockholder  shall be entitled to one vote for each share
of capital stock held by such stockholder.

         2.10     STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING

         Any action  required or  permitted to be taken at any annual or special
meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing  setting forth the action so
taken shall be signed by the holders of  outstanding  stock having not less than
the minimum  number of votes that would be  necessary  to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares  entitled to vote  thereon  were present
and voted. Such consents shall be delivered to the corporation by delivery to it
registered office in the state of Delaware,  its principal place of business, or
an  officer  or agent of the  corporation  having  custody  of the book in which
proceedings  of  meetings  of  stockholders  are  recorded.  Delivery  made to a
corporation's  registered  office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested.

         2.11     RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING

         For purposes of determining the stockholders  entitled to notice of any
meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record
date,  which  shall not precede  the date upon which the  resolution  fixing the
record  date is adopted by the board of  directors  and which  shall not be more
than  sixty  (60) days nor less than ten (10) days  before  the date of any such
meeting,  and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are
entitled to notice and to vote,  notwithstanding  any  transfer of any shares on
the books of the corporation after the record date.

         If the board of  directors  does not so fix a record  date,  the record
date for determining  stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting
of  stockholders  shall be at the close of  business  on the  business  day next
preceding  the day on which  notice is given,  or, if notice is  waived,  at the
close of  business  on the  business  day next  preceding  the day on which  the
meeting is held.

         A  determination  of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders  shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting
unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting,
but the  board of  directors  shall  fix a new  record  date if the  meeting  is
adjourned  for more than  thirty  (30)  days from the date set for the  original
meeting.

         The record date for any other  purpose  shall be as provided in Section
8.1 of these bylaws.

         2.12     PROXIES

         Every person  entitled to vote for  directors,  or on any other matter,
shall  have  the  right  to do so  either  in  person  or by one or more  agents
authorized  by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary
of the  corporation,  but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three
(3) years from its date,  unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy
shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether
by manual signature,  typewriting,  telegraphic  transmission,  telefacsimile or
otherwise)  by  the  stockholder  or  the  stockholder's  attorney-in-fact.  The
revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable  shall be

         3.1      POWERS

         Subject to the  provisions of the General  Corporation  Law of Delaware
and to any  limitations  in the  certificate  of  incorporation  or these bylaws
relating  to  action  required  to be  approved  by the  stockholders  or by the
outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed
and all  corporate  powers shall be  exercised by or under the  direction of the
board of directors.

         3.2      NUMBER OF DIRECTORS

         The board of directors shall consist of four (4) members. The number of
directors  may be changed by an  amendment  to this bylaw,  duly  adopted by the

         3.3      ELECTION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS

         Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws,  directors  shall be
elected at each annual  meeting of  stockholders  to hold office  until the next
annual meeting. Each director, including a director elected or appointed to fill
a vacancy,  shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected
and until a successor has been elected and qualified.

         3.4      RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES

         Any  director  may resign  effective  on giving  written  notice to the
chairman of the board,  the president,  the secretary or the board of directors,
unless  the  notice  specifies  a later  time for  that  resignation  to  become
effective.  If the  resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the
board of  directors  may elect a successor  to take office when the  resignation
becomes effective.

         Vacancies in the board of directors  may be filled by a majority of the
remaining  directors,  even  if  less  than a  quorum,  or by a  sole  remaining
director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of
the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares  represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which
a quorum is  present  (which  shares  voting  affirmatively  also  constitute  a
majority of the required  quorum).  Each  director so elected  shall hold office
until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been
elected and qualified.

         Unless otherwise  provided in the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws:

                  (i) Vacancies and newly created  directorships  resulting from
any  increase  in the  authorized  number  of  directors  elected  by all of the
stockholders  having  the  right to vote as a single  class  may be  filled by a
majority of the directors then in office,  although less than a quorum,  or by a
sole remaining director.

                  (ii)  Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or
series  thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of
the certificate of incorporation,  vacancies and newly created  directorships of
such class or classes  or series  may be filled by a majority  of the  directors
elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office,  or by a sole
remaining director so elected.

         If at any time, by reason of death or resignation  or other cause,  the
corporation  should  have no  directors  in  office,  then  any  officer  or any
stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder,
or other fiduciary  entrusted with like  responsibility for the person or estate
of a stockholder,  may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with
the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply
to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided
in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

         If,  at  the  time  of  filling  any  vacancy  or  any  newly   created
directorship,  the directors then in office  constitute  less than a majority of
the whole board (as constituted  immediately  prior to any such increase),  then
the Court of Chancery may, upon  application of any  stockholder or stockholders
holding at least ten (10)  percent of the total number of the shares at the time
outstanding  having  the right to vote for such  directors,  summarily  order an
election to be held to fill any such  vacancies or newly created  directorships,
or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid,
which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.

         3.5      REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS

         Unless  otherwise   restricted  by  statute,   by  the  certificate  of
incorporation or by these bylaws,  any director or the entire board of directors
may be  removed,  with or without  cause,  by the  holders of a majority  of the
shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

         3.6      PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE

         Regular  meetings  of the board of  directors  may be held at any place
within or outside the State of Delaware  that has been  designated  from time to

         The first  meeting of each newly  elected  board of directors  shall be
held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at
the annual meeting.  In the event of the failure of the  stockholders to fix the
time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors,  or
in the  event  such  meeting  is not held at the time and  place so fixed by the
stockholders,  the  meeting  may be held at such  time  and  place  as  shall be
specified in a notice given as hereinafter  provided for special meetings of the
board of directors,  or as shall be specified in a written  waiver signed by all
of the directors.

president, the secretary or any two directors.

         Notice of the time and place of  special  meetings  shall be  delivered

telecopy  or  telegram,  charges  prepaid,  addressed  to each  director at that
director's  address  as it is shown on the  records of the  corporation.  If the
notice is mailed,  it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four
(4) days  before  the time of the  holding  of the  meeting.  If the  notice  is
delivered  personally  or by  telephone,  telecopy  or  telegram,  it  shall  be
delivered  personally  or by  telephone  or to the  telegraph  company  at least
forty-eight  (48) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting.  Any oral
notice  given  personally  or by  telephone  may be  communicated  either to the
director or to a person at the office of the director who the person  giving the
notice has reason to believe will promptly  communicate it to the director.  The
notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting,  if the meeting
is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.

         3.10     QUORUM

         A majority of the  authorized  number of directors  shall  constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn as provided in Section
3.12 of these  bylaws.  Every act or decision  done or made by a majority of the
directors  present at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present  shall be
regarded as the act of the board of directors,  subject to the provisions of the
certificate of incorporation and applicable law.

         A meeting  at which a quorum  is  initially  present  may  continue  to
transact  business  notwithstanding  the withdrawal of directors,  if any action
taken is approved by at least a majority of the quorum for that meeting.

         3.11     WAIVER OF NOTICE

         Notice of a meeting  need not be given to any  director (i) who signs a
waiver of notice,  whether before or after the meeting,  or (ii) who attends the
meeting other than for the express purposed of objecting at the beginning of the
meeting to the  transaction of any business  because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened.  All such waivers shall be filed with the corporate  records
or made part of the minutes of the meeting.  A waiver of notice need not specify
the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board of directors.

may be  taken  without  a  meeting,  provided  that  all  members  of the  board
individually or collectively  consent in writing to that action.  Such action by
written  consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the
board of directors.  Such written consent and any counterparts  thereof shall be

         Directors and members of committees may receive such  compensation,  if
any, for their  services and such  reimbursement  of expenses as may be fixed or

stock of the corporation.  Nothing  contained in this section shall be deemed to
deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at
common law or under any statute.

The board may  designate one (1) or more  directors as alternate  members of any
committee,  who may replace any absent or disqualified  member at any meeting of

requires  the vote of a majority  of the  authorized  number of  directors.  Any
committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board, shall have and
may exercise all the powers and  authority of the board,  but no such  committee
shall have the power or authority to (i) amend the certificate of  incorporation
(except that a committee  may, to the extent  authorized  in the  resolution  or
resolutions  providing  for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the board
of directors  as provided in Section  151(a) of the General  Corporation  Law of
Delaware,  fix the  designations  and any of the  preferences  or rights of such
shares  relating to dividends,  redemption,  dissolution,  any  distribution  of
assets of the corpo  ration or the  conversion  into,  or the  exchange  of such
shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same
or any  other  class or  classes  of stock of the  corporation),  (ii)  adopt an
agreement of merger or  consolidation  under  Sections 251 or 252 of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware, (iii) recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease
or  exchange  of all or  substantially  all of the  corporation's  property  and
assets, (iv) recommend to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a
revocation of a  dissolution  or (v) amend the bylaws of the  corporation;  and,
unless  the board  resolution  establishing  the  committee,  the  bylaws or the
certificate of incorporation  expressly so provide, no such committee shall have
the power or  authority  to declare a dividend,  to  authorize  the  issuance of
stock, or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section 253
of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

         4.2      MEETINGS AND ACTION OF COMMITTEES

and its  members;  provided,  however,  that the  time of  regular  meetings  of
committees  may be determined  either by resolution of the board of directors or
by resolution of the committee,  that special meetings of committees may also be
called by  resolution  of the board of  directors,  and that  notice of  special

                INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES
                                AND OTHER AGENTS


         6.1      INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

         The  corporation  shall,  to the  maximum  extent  and  in  the  manner
permitted by the General  Corporation  Law of Delaware as the same now exists or
may  hereafter be amended,  indemnify  any person  against  expenses  (including
attorneys' fees), judgments,  fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably  incurred in  connection  with any  threatened,  pending or completed
action,  suit,  or  proceeding  in  which  such  person  was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the  corporation.  For  purposes of this  Section  6.1, a
"director" or "officer" of the  corporation  shall mean any person (i) who is or
was a director or officer of the corporation,  (ii) who is or was serving at the
request  of the  corporation  as a director  or officer of another  corporation,
partnership,  joint  venture,  trust or  other  enterprise,  or (iii)  who was a
director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor  corporation of the
corporation  or of  another  enterprise  at  the  request  of  such  predecessor
corporation.

         The corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in
connection  with an action,  suit, or proceeding (or part thereof)  initiated by
such  director  or officer  only if the  initiation  of such  action,  suit,  or
proceeding  (or part  thereof) by the director or officer was  authorized by the
board of Directors of the corporation.

         The  corporation  shall pay the expenses  (including  attorney's  fees)
incurred by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification
hereunder  in  defending  any  action,  suit or  proceeding  referred to in this
Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment
of expenses  incurred by a director or officer of the  corporation in advance of
the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon
receipt of an  undertaking  by the  director  or  officer  to repay all  amounts
advanced if it should  ultimately be determined  that the director or officer is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.

         The  rights  conferred  on any  person  by this  Article  shall  not be
exclusive of any other  rights  which such person may have or hereafter  acquire
under any statute,  provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation,
these bylaws,  agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise.

         Any repeal or modification of the foregoing  provisions of this Article
shall not adversely  affect any right or  protection  hereunder of any person in
respect of any act or  omission  occurring  prior to the time of such  repeal or
modification.

         6.2      INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS

         The corporation  shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the
manner  permitted  by the  General  Corporation  Law of Delaware as the same now
exists or may  hereafter  be  amended,  to  indemnify  any  person  (other  than
directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines,  and amounts  paid in  settlement  actually  and  reasonably  incurred in
connection  with  any  threatened,   pending  or  completed  action,   suit,  or
proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party by reason of the fact that such  person is or was an  employee or agent of
the  corporation.  For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of
the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who
is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at
the request of the  corporation as an employee or agent of another  corporation,
partnership,  joint  venture,  trust or other  enterprise,  or (iii)  who was an
employee or agent of a corporation  which was a predecessor  corporation  of the
corporation  or of  another  enterprise  at  the  request  of  such  predecessor
corporation.

         6.3      INSURANCE

         The  corporation  may purchase and maintain  insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director,  officer, employee or agent of the corporation,
or is or was serving at the request of the  corporation as a director,  officer,
employee or agent of another corporation,  partnership,  joint venture, trust or
other enterprise  against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred
by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such,
whether  or not the  corporation  would have the power to  indemnify  him or her
against such liability  under the provisions of the General  Corporation  Law of
Delaware.

         6.4      SAVINGS CLAUSE

         If this Article VI or any portion  thereof shall be  invalidated on any
ground  by any  court of  competent  jurisdiction,  then the  corporation  shall
nevertheless  indemnify  each  director,  officer,  employee  or  agent  of  the
corporation against expenses (including attorney's fees),  judgments,  fines and
amounts paid in  settlement  with  respect to any action,  suit,  proceeding  or
investigation,  whether civil, criminal or administrative,  and whether internal
or external,  including a grand jury proceeding and an action or suit brought by
or in the  right  of  the  corporation,  to the  full  extent  permitted  by any
applicable  portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated,  or by
any other applicable law.

         6.5      CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF
                  EXPENSES

         The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VI shall,  unless  otherwise prided when authorized or
ratified,  continue  as to a person  who has ceased to be a  director,  officer,
employee  or agent and shall inure to the  benefit of the heirs,  executors  and
administrators of such a person.

         7.1      MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS

         The corporation shall,  either at its principal  executive office or at
such place or places as designated  by the board of directors,  keep a record of
its  stockholders  listing their names and addresses and the number and class of
shares  held by each  stockholder,  a copy of these  bylaws as  amended to date,
accounting books and other records of its business and properties.

         Any  stockholder  of record,  in person or by attorney or other  agent,
shall,  upon written  demand under oath  stating the purpose  thereof,  have the
right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper  purpose the
corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders,  and its other books and
records and to make copies or extracts therefrom.  A proper purpose shall mean a
purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder.  In every
instance  where an  attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to
inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or
such other  writing  that  authorizes  the  attorney or other agent to so act on
behalf of the  stockholder.  The  demand  under oath  shall be  directed  to the
corporation  at its registered  office in Delaware or at its principal  place of
business.

         7.2      INSPECTION BY DIRECTORS

         Any director  shall have the right to examine the  corporation's  stock
ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose
reasonably related to his or her position as a director.

         7.3      ANNUAL STATEMENT TO STOCKHOLDERS

special meeting of the stockholders when called for by vote of the stockholders,
a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the corporation.

         The chairman of the board,  if any, the president,  any vice president,
the chief financial  officer,  the secretary or any assistant  secretary of this
corporation,  or any other  person  authorized  by the board of directors or the
president or a vice president,  is authorized to vote, represent and exercise on
behalf of this  corporation  all  rights  incident  to any and all shares of the
stock of any other  corporation  or  corporations  standing  in the name of this
corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person
directly  or by any  other  person  authorized  to do so by  proxy  or  power of
attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.

         7.5      CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION OF BYLAWS

         The original or a copy of these bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered

                                 GENERAL MATTERS


         8.1      RECORD DATE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN NOTICE AND VOTING

         For  purposes  of  determining  the  stockholders  entitled  to receive
payment of any dividend or other  distribution or allotment of any rights or the
stockholders  entitled  to  exercise  any  rights  in  respect  of  any  change,
conversion or exchange of stock,  or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
the board of  directors  may fix, in  advance,  a record  date,  which shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and
which  shall not be more than sixty (60) days  before any such  action.  In that
case, only  stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed
are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to
exercise such rights,  as the case may be,  notwithstanding  any transfer of any
shares on the books of the corpo ration  after the record date so fixed,  except
as otherwise provided by law.

         If the  board of  directors  does not so fix a  record  date,  then the
record date for  determining  stockholders  for any such purpose shall be at the
close  of  business  on the day on  which  the  board of  directors  adopts  the
applicable resolution.

         8.2      CHECKS; DRAFTS; EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS

         From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution
which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for
payment of money, notes or other


                                       19


<PAGE>



evidences  of  indebtedness  that are  issued in the name of or  payable  to the
corporation,  and only the  persons so  authorized  shall sign or endorse  those
instruments.

         8.3      CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS:  HOW EXECUTED

         The board of directors,  except as otherwise  provided in these bylaws,
may authorize and empower any officer or officers,  or agent or agents, to enter
into any contract or execute any  instrument in the name of and on behalf of the
corporation;  such power and  authority  may be general or  confined to specific
instances.  Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within
the agency  power of an officer,  no officer,  agent or employee  shall have any
power or authority to bind the  corporation  by any contract or engagement or to
pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.

         8.4      STOCK CERTIFICATES; TRANSFER; PARTLY PAID SHARES

         The shares of the  corporation  shall be represented  by  certificates,
provided  that  the  board  of  directors  of the  corporation  may  provide  by
resolution  or  resolutions  that some or all of any or all classes or series of
its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to
shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
corporation.  Notwithstanding  the adoption of such a resolution by the board of
directors,  every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request,
every holder of uncertificated  shares,  shall be entitled to have a certificate
signed by, or in the name of the corporation  by, the chairman or  vice-chairman
of the  board of  directors,  or the  president  or  vice-president,  and by the
treasurer or an assistant treasurer,  or the secretary or an assistant secretary
of such corporation  representing the number of shares registered in certificate
form. Any or all of the  signatures on the  certificate  may be a facsimile.  In
case any officer,  transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature  has been placed  upon a  certificate  has ceased to be such  officer,
transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued,  it may be issued
by the  corporation  with the same  effect  as if he or she were  such  officer,
transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

         Certificates  for shares  shall be of such form and device as the board
of directors  may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the
shares represented thereby;  its number; date of issuance;  the number of shares
for  which it is  issued;  a  summary  statement  or  reference  to the  powers,
designations,  preferences  or  other  special  rights  of  such  stock  and the
qualifications,  limitations or restrictions of such preferences  and/or rights,
if any;  a  statement  or  summary of liens,  if any;  a  conspicuous  notice of
restrictions  upon transfer or registration of transfer,  if any; a statement as
to any applicable  voting trust agreement;  if the shares be assessable,  or, if
assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.

         Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of
a certificate  for shares duly  endorsed or  accompanied  by proper  evidence of
succession,  assignment  or authority  to transfer,  it shall be the duty of the
corporation to issue a new  certificate to the person entitled  thereto,  cancel
the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.

<PAGE>



         The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly
paid and  subject  to call for the  remainder  of the  consideration  to be paid
therefor.  Upon the face or back of each stock  certificate  issued to represent
any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in
the  case  of  uncertificated  partly  paid  shares,  the  total  amount  of the
consideration  to be paid  therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.
Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall
declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class,  but only upon the
basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

         8.5      SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES

         If the  corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock
or more than one series of any class,  then the powers,  the  designations,  the
preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
each class of stock or series  thereof and the  qualifications,  limitations  or
restrictions  of such  preferences  and/or  rights shall be set forth in full or
summarized on the face or back of the  certificate  that the  corporation  shall
issue to  represent  such  class or series of stock;  provided,  however,  that,
except as otherwise  provided in Section 202 of the General  Corporation  Law of
Delaware,  in lieu of the foregoing  requirements  there may be set forth on the
face or back of the certificate  that the  corporation  shall issue to represent
such class or series of stock a  statement  that the  corporation  will  furnish
without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations,
the  preferences  and the  relative,  participating,  optional or other  special
rights  of each  class  of  stock  or  series  thereof  and the  qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

         8.6      LOST CERTIFICATES

         Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new  certificates for shares
shall be issued to replace a previously issued  certificate unless the latter is
surrendered  to the  corporation  and  cancelled at the same time.  The board of
directors  may,  in case any  share  certificate  or  certificate  for any other
security is lost,  stolen or destroyed,  authorize  the issuance of  replacement
certificates  on such terms and  conditions as the board may require;  the board
may  require  indemnification  of the  corporation  secured  by a bond or  other
adequate security  sufficient to protect the corporation  against any claim that
may be made against it,  including any expense or  liability,  on account of the
alleged loss,  theft or  destruction  of the  certificate or the issuance of the
replacement certificate.

         8.7      TRANSFER AGENTS AND REGISTRARS

         The board of  directors  may  appoint  one or more  transfer  agents or
transfer  clerks,  and  one or  more  registrars,  each  of  which  shall  be an
incorporated  bank or trust company -- either domestic or foreign,  who shall be
appointed at such times and places as the  requirements  of the  corporation may
necessitate and the board of directors may designate.

         8.8      CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS

         Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of
construction  and  definitions in the General  Corporation Law of Delaware shall
govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this
provision, as used in these bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the
plural  number  includes the singular,  and the term  "person"  includes both an
entity and a natural person.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   AMENDMENTS


         The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended
or repealed by the stockholders  entitled to vote; provided,  however,  that the
corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt,
amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.  The fact that such power has been so
conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor
limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.

         Whenever an  amendment  or new bylaw is adopted,  it shall be copied in
the book of bylaws with the original  bylaws,  in the appropriate  place. If any
bylaw is repealed,  the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the
repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative  written  consent(s)  shall be
stated in said book.

        SELECTED PORTIONS OF ADVENT'S 1997 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS




<PAGE>
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

    Advent  provides  stand-alone  and  client/server  software  products,  data
interfaces and related  maintenance  and services that  automate,  integrate and
support certain mission-critical  functions of the front, middle and back office
of investment management  organizations.  Advent's clients vary significantly in
size and assets under  management  and include  investment  advisors,  brokerage
firms,  banks,  hedge  funds,  corporations,   public  funds,  universities  and
non-profit organizations.

Initial Public Offering

    In November 1995, Advent completed an initial public offering (IPO) in which
it sold 1,450,000 shares of its common stock at $18.00 per share which generated
net proceeds to Advent of $23.4 million.

Recent Developments

    In February 1998,  Advent issued 250,000 shares of Advent's  common stock in
exchange  for all of the  outstanding  shares  of  MicroEdge,  Inc.,  a  private
software  development  company  based  in New  York.  MicroEdge  is the  leading
provider  of  software   products  to   foundations,   corporations   and  other
organizations to manage their grant-making activities. This business combination
was accounted  for as a pooling of interests.  The results of operations as well
as the assets and liabilities of MicroEdge in 1997 and 1996 were not material to
the consolidated results of operations or financial position of Advent.

Acquisitions

    In February  1996,  Advent  acquired Data Exchange,  Inc. (the DX Group),  a
private company based in New York, for $4.0 million in cash and an $800,000 note
payable.  This note was paid  during the third  quarter of 1996 and did not bear
interest.  The  transaction  was accounted for as a purchase.  Advent incurred a
one-time  charge of $5.6 million in connection  with the write-off of in-process
research and  development.  This expense was recorded in purchased  research and
development and other expenses.

    In November  1996,  Advent issued 35,000 shares of Advent's  common stock in
exchange for all of the  outstanding  shares of Bold  Software,  Inc., a private
software  development  company based in New York. This business  combination was
accounted  for as a pooling  of  interests.  Prior  year  amounts  have not been
restated to include Bold  Software's  results of operations  as such  operations
were immaterial.  As a result of this business  combination,  Advent  introduced
Advent  Partner,  a tax  layering  and  partnership  allocation  solution  which
integrates with Axys.

Results of Operations For The Years Ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995

Revenues

    Net revenues  were $48.6  million,  $36.7 million and $26.0 million in 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively, representing increases of 32% from 1996 to 1997 and
42% from 1995 to 1996.  Advent's  net  revenues  are  derived  from  license and
development  fees,  maintenance and other recurring  revenues,  and professional
services  related to its software  products.  Substantially  all of Advent's net
revenues were from domestic sales, with  international  sales  representing less
than 3% of net  revenues in each of 1997,  1996 and 1995.  License  revenues are
derived from the licensing of software  products.  Development  fees are derived
from  development  contracts that Advent has entered into with other  companies.
Maintenance  and other  recurring  revenues  are derived from  maintenance  fees
charged in the  initial  licensing  year,  renewals of  maintenance  services in
subsequent  years and revenues  derived from client  utilization  of proprietary
interfaces  to  access  pricing  and  other  data  supplied  by  third  parties.
Professional   services  and  other  includes  fees  for   consulting,   systems
integration  projects,  custom programming and conversions of data from clients'
previous systems.

    During 1995,  Axys and its related  products and  services  accounted  for a
substantial  majority of such net  revenues.  In 1996 and 1997,  Advent has been
successful  in  increasing  multi-product  sales  by  emphasizing  its  suite of
products and,  therefore,  new products have accounted for an increasing portion
of net revenues.

    Each of the major revenue categories has historically varied as a percentage
of net revenues and this  variability is expected to continue in future periods.
This  variability  is  primarily  due to the timing of the  introduction  of new
products,  the relative size and timing of individual  licenses,  as well as the
complexity of the implementation and the resulting proportion of the maintenance
and professional  services  components of these license  transactions,  Advent's
pricing model and the amount of client utilization of pricing and related data.

    License and Development  Fees.  License and  development  fees revenues were
$23.7  million,  $17.0  million  and  $12.1  million  in 1997,  1996  and  1995,
respectively,  representing  increases  of 40% in both the periods  from 1996 to
1997  and  from  1995 to  1996.  License  and  development  fees  revenues  as a
percentage  of net revenues was  relatively  stable at 49%, 46% and 47% in 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively. The growth in license revenues during 1996 and 1997
was due to continued  demand for Advent's  suite of products.  Advent  typically
licenses  its  products on a per server,  per user basis with the price per site
varying  based on the  selection  of the  products  licensed  and the  number of
authorized  users.  In addition,  during 1997,  development  fees  constituted a
larger portion of net revenues. As Advent carries out larger implementations and
continues  its Internet  Initiative,  Advent may enter into further  development
contracts through which it earns development fees.

                                      -2-

    Maintenance and Other  Recurring.  Maintenance and other recurring  revenues
were $18.0  million,  $14.7  million,  and $9.9 million in 1997,  1996 and 1995,
respectively,  representing increases of 23% from 1996 to 1997 and 49% from 1995
to 1996.  Maintenance  and  other  recurring  revenues  as a  percentage  of net
revenues was 37%, 40% and 38% in 1997, 1996 and 1995,  respectively . The growth
in  maintenance  and other  recurring  revenues in both  periods  was  primarily
attributable  to a larger  customer base and higher  average  maintenance  fees.
Higher  average  maintenance  fees are due to the  increased  complexity  of the
maintenance  services  provided and increased client  utilization of proprietary
interfaces  to access  pricing  and other data  supplied  by  external  parties.
Advent's  proprietary  interfaces enable users of Axys to retrieve critical data
from external sources,  including pricing, corporate actions, and analytical and
fundamental  data via  interfaces to  information  vendors,  such as Interactive
Data.  The  impact of the  change in higher  average  maintenance  fees was more
pronounced  in 1996  versus 1997 which led to a smaller  percentage  increase in
maintenance  and other recurring  revenues from 1996 to 1997. In addition,  this
led to the increase in the  percentage of these  revenues as a percentage of net
revenues in 1996 and the subsequent decrease in 1997.

    Professional  Services and Other.  Revenues from  professional  services and
other were $6.9 million,  $5.1 million and $3.9 million in 1997,  1996 and 1995,
respectively,  representing increases of 35% from 1996 to 1997 and 30% from 1995
to 1996.  Professional  services and other as a  percentage  of net revenues was
relatively stable at 14%, 14% and 15% in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  The
growth in revenues from professional services and other in 1996 and 1997 was due
to additional  consulting revenue associated with higher product sales activity,
and  additional  interface  business  resulting  from higher  market  demand for
automated interfaces.

Cost of Revenues

    Cost of  License  and  Development  Fees.  Cost  of  license  revenues  were
$601,000,   $600,000  and  $469,000  in  1997,  1996  and  1995,   respectively,
representing 3%, 4% and 4% of license  revenues in these periods,  respectively.
Cost of license  revenues  consists  primarily of the cost of product  media and
duplication,  manuals,  packaging  materials  and the direct  labor  involved in
producing and distributing Advent's software.

    Cost of  Maintenance  and Other  Recurring.  Cost of  maintenance  and other
recurring  revenues  were $4.8  million,  $3.8 million and $2.4 million in 1997,
1996 and 1995,  respectively,  representing  27%, 26% and 24% of maintenance and
other  recurring  revenues  in these  periods,  respectively.  These  costs  are
primarily comprised of the direct costs of providing technical support and other
services  for  recurring  revenues and the  engineering  costs  associated  with
product  updates.  These  expenses  as a  percentage  of  maintenance  and other
recurring  revenues  increased  in 1996  and  1997  due to  increased  resources
allocated to the support services.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>



    Cost of Professional  Services and Other. Cost of professional  services and
other  revenues were $3.6 million,  $2.5 million and $2.0 million in 1997,  1996
and 1995,  respectively,  representing 53%, 49% and 52% of professional services
and other revenues in these periods, respectively. These costs consist primarily
of personnel related costs of the client services and support  organization that
are incurred in  providing  consulting,  systems  integration  projects,  custom
programming,   conversions  of  data  from  clients'   previous   systems,   and
participating in Advent-sponsored conferences. To the extent that such personnel
are not fully utilized in consulting, training, conversion or custom programming
projects,  they are allocated to presales,  marketing and engineering activities
and the resultant costs are charged to operating expenses.  Cost of professional
services  and  other  increased  in 1997 and 1996  primarily  as a result of the
increased staffing necessary to provide services to an expanding installed base.
Cost of professional  services increased as a percentage of the related revenues
in 1997 compared with 1996 due primarily to the increase in personnel  dedicated
to  accelerating  the conversion of existing  clients to Axys Release 2. Cost of
professional  services decreased as a percentage of the related revenues in 1996
compared with 1995 due to economies of scale.

Operating Expenses

    Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses were $15.6 million, $12.4
million  and $9.3  million in 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively,  representing
increases  of 25%  from  1996 to 1997  and 34%  from  1995 to  1996.  Sales  and
marketing  expenses as a  percentage  of net  revenues  were 32%, 34% and 36% in
1997,  1996  and  1995,  respectively.  Sales  and  marketing  expenses  consist
primarily of costs of all personnel involved in the sales and marketing process,
sales  commissions,  advertising and  promotional  materials,  sales  facilities
expense,  trade shows, and seminars.  Sales and marketing  expenses increased in
1997 and 1996  primarily  due to the  continued  increase in sales and marketing
employees  and  expenses  for  marketing  materials  needed to address new sales
opportunities  and to support the introduction of new products.  The decrease in
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues in both periods was
due  primarily to the ability of Advent's  sales and marketing  organization  to
support  an  increased  revenue  base.  In  addition,  the  decrease  was due to
increased  contribution  of  maintenance  and other  recurring  revenues  to net
revenues which did not have significant associated sales and marketing expenses.

    Product Development.  Product development  expenses were $9.4 million,  $6.7
million  and $4.2  million in 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively,  representing
increases  of 40%  from  1996  to 1997  and  60%  from  1995  to  1996.  Product
development  expenses as a percentage  of net revenues  were 19%, 18% and 16% of
net  revenues  in these  periods,  respectively.  Product  development  expenses
consist primarily of personnel costs and,  accordingly,  the increase in product
development  expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in
each of these periods was primarily  attributable to an increase in personnel as
Advent increased its product  development  efforts to accelerate the rate of new
product  introductions.  Advent  anticipates  that it will  continue  to  devote
substantial  resources to product  development.  Development costs subsequent to
achievement of technological  feasibility have not been significant during these
periods and, accordingly, all such costs have been expensed as incurred.

                                      -4-

    General and  Administrative.  General and administrative  expenses were $5.1
million,  $4.4  million and $3.4 million in 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively,
representing  increases  of 16% from  1996 to 1997  and 29%  from  1995 to 1996.
General and  administrative  expenses as a percentage  of net revenues were 11%,
12% and 13% in 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.  General and  administrative
expenses  consist  primarily  of personnel  costs for  finance,  administration,
operations and general management, as well as legal and accounting expenses. The
increase in general and  administrative  expenses in these periods was primarily
due to continued  growth in finance,  administration  and  operations  which was
necessary to support Advent's growth.  General and administrative  expenses as a
percentage of net revenues decreased in 1997 and 1996 due to economies of scale.

    Purchased  Research and Development and Other. In the first quarter of 1996,
Advent  incurred  a  one-time  charge of $5.6  million  in  connection  with the
write-off of in-process  research and  development due to the acquisition of the
DX Group.

Interest Income, Net

    Interest  income,  net was $1,236,000,  $1,165,000 and $447,000 and in 1997,
1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Interest income, net consists of interest income,
interest expense and miscellaneous  non-operating  income and expense items. The
increases were due to greater  interest  income  generated in 1996 and 1997 from
higher  cash  and  cash  equivalent  balances.  The  increase  in cash  and cash
equivalents  in  1997  was  due  primarily  to  cash  generated  from  operating
activities. The increase in 1996 was primarily as a result of the IPO.


Income Taxes

    Advent had effective tax rates of 37%, 163% and 39% in 1997,  1996 and 1995,
respectively.  The  effective  tax  rate  in 1996  reflected  the  $5.6  million
write-off of in-process  research and  development  which was not deductible for
tax  purposes.  Excluding  the effect of the  write-off on the 1996 rate,  these
rates differ from the federal  statutory rate primarily due to state income tax,
offset by certain research and development credits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    Advent funds its operations  primarily from cash generated from  operations.
Net cash provided by operating  activities  was $7.7  million,  $1.6 million and
$5.7 million in 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Net cash used in investing
activities  was $14.1 million,  $5.6 million and $1.0 million in 1997,  1996 and
1995,  respectively.  The 1997 amount  includes  $8.9  million in  purchases  of
short-term investments, net of maturities.  Included in the 1996 amount for cash
used in  investing  activities  was $4.0 million for the  acquisition  of the DX
Group.  The remaining  1996 amount and the 1997 and 1995 amounts were  primarily
for the acquisition of fixed assets.  Net cash provided by financing  activities
was $2.0  million in 1997  primarily  from  proceeds  from the exercise of stock
options and from  proceeds  from the issuance of common stock  through  Advent's
employee stock purchase plan. Net cash provided 

                                      -5-
<PAGE>


by financing  activities  was $601,000 in 1996  primarily from proceeds from the
issuance of common stock and from  proceeds  from the exercise of stock  options
offset  by the  payment  of  debt  assumed  and a note  issued  in the DX  Group
acquisition.  Net cash  provided  by  financing  activities  in 1995  was  $22.7
million,  primarily  from net  proceeds  from the IPO. As of December  31, 1997,
Advent had $36.1 million in cash, cash  equivalents and short-term  investments.
Advent  believes  that  its  existing  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  short-term
investments and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient
to meet its cash and capital requirements at least through fiscal 1998.

Impact of Year 2000 Issue

    Advent's  products  have been and will  continue to be Year 2000  compliant.
Year 2000  compliant  means that  Advent's  products  will  continue  to operate
substantially in accordance with Advent's  published  documentation on and after
January 1, 2000.  In  addition,  internal  systems  that Advent  relies upon for
day-to-day  operations  are  believed  to be Year 2000  compliant.  Accordingly,
Advent does not anticipate  incurring  significant  expenditures related to Year
2000 issues.

New Accounting Pronouncements

    In June 1997, the FASB issued  Statement No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive
Income",  (SFAS 130) which  establishes  standards  for reporting and display of
comprehensive  income  and  its  components  in a full  set  of  general-purpose
financial statements.  It is effective for Advent's first quarter of fiscal year
1998.

    In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise  and Related  Information",  (SFAS 131) which  changes  current
practice under SFAS 14 by  establishing a new framework on which to base segment
reporting  (referred to as the "management"  approach) and also requires interim
reporting of segment  information.  It is effective for Advent's fiscal year-end
1998.

    In October  1997,  the AICPA  issued  Statement  of  Position  (SOP) 97-2 on
Software Revenue Recognition which supersedes SOP 91-1. The SOP is effective for
all fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 1997 and will be effective  for
Advent's fiscal year 1998.

    Advent will be studying the  implications of these standards and has not yet
determined the impact of their implementation on Advent's financial statements.

Forward-Looking Statements

The discussion in "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition
and Results of Operations"  contains  trend  analysis and other  forward-looking
statements  that are  based on  current  expectations  and  assumptions  made by
management.  Words  such  as  "expects",   "anticipates",   "intends",  "plans",
"believes",  "seeks",  "estimates",  and  variations  of such words and  similar
expressions  are intended to identify  such  forward-looking  statements.  These
statements are not guarantees of future  performance  and involve  certain risks
and  uncertainties  which are difficult to predict.  Therefore,  actual  results
could   differ   materially   from  those   expressed  or   forecasted   in  the
forward-looking

                                      -6-

statements as a result of the factors summarized below and other risks detailed
from time to time in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission,
including Advent's 1997 Form 10-K Report. Additionally, the financial statements
for the  periods  presented  are not  necessarily  indicative  of  results to be
expected for any future  period.  Advent  undertakes no obligation to update any
forward-looking statements.

Advent  operates in a rapidly  changing  environment  that  involves a number of
risks,  some of which are beyond  Advent's  control.  These  risks  include  the
potential  for  period to  period  fluctuations  in  operating  results  and the
dependence on the successful  development and market  acceptance of new products
and product  enhancements  on a timely,  cost  effective  basis,  as well as the
stability  of  financial  markets,  maintenance  of Advent's  relationship  with
Interactive Data and price and product/performance  competition.  In particular,
Advent's net  revenues and  operating  results  have varied  substantially  from
period-to-period  on a quarterly  basis and may continue to  fluctuate  due to a
number of factors.  Advent's  software  products  typically are shipped  shortly
after receipt of a signed license agreement. License backlog at the beginning of
any quarter typically represents only a small portion of that quarter's expected
revenues.   In  addition,   as  Advent's  licenses  into  multi-user   networked
environments  have increased both in individual size and number,  the timing and
size of individual  license  transactions  are becoming  increasingly  important
factors in Advent's  quarterly  operating  results.  The sales  cycles for these
transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable, and the ability to close large
license  transactions  on a  timely  basis  or at  all  could  cause  additional
variability in Advent's  quarterly  operating  results.  Advent's future success
will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products,  such as Moxy,
Qube,  and Geneva,  that address the future  needs of its target  markets and to
respond to emerging  industry  standards  and  practices.  Advent is directing a
significant  amount  of  its  product   development   efforts  on  the  on-going
development of Geneva.  The failure to achieve  widespread  market acceptance of
Geneva on a timely basis would adversely affect Advent's  business and operating
results.  To take  advantage  of the  Internet,  Advent has launched an Internet
Initiative whereby it is developing services, both announced and unannounced, to
bring  Internet  based  products  and  services to  clients.  The first of these
services,  Rex, was launched during the second quarter of 1997. As Advent begins
development of new products and services under its Internet  Initiative,  it has
and  will  continue  to  enter  into  development  agreements  with  information
providers,  clients,  or other  companies in order to accelerate the delivery of
new  products  and  services.  There can be no  assurance  that  Advent  will be
successful in marketing Rex or in developing other Internet  services.  Advent's
failure to do so could adversely affect Advent's business and operating results.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

    OPERATIONS Advent provides stand-alone and client/server  software products,
data interfaces and related  maintenance  and services that automate,  integrate
and support  certain  mission-critical  functions of the front,  middle and back
office  of   investment   management   organizations.   Advent's   clients  vary
significantly  in size  and  assets  under  management  and  include  investment
advisors,  brokerage  firms,  banks,  hedge funds,  corporations,  public funds,
foundations, universities and non-profit organizations.

   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts  of  Advent  and  its  wholly-owned   subsidiaries.   All  intercompany
transactions and amounts have been eliminated.

    FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS Cash equivalents  comprise highly liquid  investments
purchased with a remaining  maturity of 90 days or less.  These  investments are
maintained with major financial institutions.

    Short- term  investments  are  comprised  of various  marketable  securities
carried  at  cost.  These   investments  are  maintained  with  major  financial
institutions. Securities are considered to be held-to-maturity. Amounts reported
for short-term investments are considered to approximate the fair value based on
comparable market  information  available at the respective balance sheet dates.
Realized gains and losses have not been significant.

    The amounts reported for cash  equivalents,  receivables,  accounts payable,
accrued   liabilities  and  other   financial   instruments  are  considered  to
approximate their market values based on comparable market information available
at the respective balance sheet dates, and their short-term nature.

    Financial  instruments that potentially  subject Advent to concentrations of
credit risks comprise,  principally,  cash,  short-term  investments,  and trade
accounts receivable. Advent invests excess cash through banks, mutual funds, and
brokerage  houses   primarily  in  highly  liquid   investments  with  remaining
maturities of 90 days or less and has investment  policies and procedures  which
are  reviewed  periodically  to minimize  credit  risk.  Advent does not require
collateral  from its  customers  but performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations  and
maintains  reserves for  potential  credit losses which  historically  have been
within management's estimates.

    DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION Fixed assets are stated at cost.  Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
related assets, generally five years.  Amortization of leasehold improvements is
computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
life of the assets or the remaining lease term.

    CAPITALIZED  SOFTWARE  Costs  incurred  for  software  development  prior to
technological  feasibility  are  expensed  as product  development  costs in the
period  incurred.  Once  the  point of  technological  feasibility  is  reached,
production  costs are  capitalized.  Such  capitalized  software  costs were not
material in 1997, 1996 and 1995.

                                      -12-

    REVENUE RECOGNITION Advent licenses application software programs and offers
annual maintenance  programs which provides for technical support and updates to
software  products.   Advent's  development  agreements  generally  provide  for
development  of  technologies  and products which are expected to become part of
Advent's product or product offerings in the future. Certain of these agreements
may require  royalty  payments based on future sales of the developed  products.
Such  amounts  will be included  in cost of goods sold as  accrued.  Advent also
offers customers on-site consulting services,  training, custom programming, and
other services.

    License  revenue is recognized  upon the shipment of a product to the client
if collection  is probable and Advent's  remaining  obligations  with respect to
that contract are  insignificant.  License  revenue for licenses with  remaining
significant  obligations  is deferred  until the  product  has been  shipped and
Advent's related  obligations  become  insignificant.  Maintenance  revenues are
recognized  ratably  over  the  term  of  the  contract.   Annual  payments  for
maintenance  contracts are generally  received in advance and are nonrefundable.
Revenues  for  interface  and  other  development  and  custom  programming  are
recognized using the percentage of completion  method of accounting based on the
costs incurred to date compared with the estimated cost of completion.  Revenues
from professional services are recognized as work is performed.

    NET INCOME  (LOSS) PER SHARE Advent has adopted the  provisions of Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 128,  Earnings  Per Share ("SFAS 128")
effective  December 31, 1997.  SFAS 128 requires the  presentation  of basic and
diluted  net  income  (loss) per  share.  Basic net  income  (loss) per share is
computed by dividing net income (loss)  available to common  stockholders by the
weighted  average number of common shares  outstanding for that period.  Diluted
net income (loss) per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive  potential
common shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares
consist of incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and
warrants and conversion of preferred stock for all periods. All prior period net
income (loss) per share amounts have been restated to comply with SFAS No. 128.

    RECLASSIFICATIONS  Certain  reclassifications have been made to the 1996 and
1995  financial  statement  amounts to conform to the 1997  presentation.  These
reclassifications  had no impact on net income (loss),  working capital, or cash
flows.

    NEW ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS  In June 1997, the FASB issued  Statement No.
130, "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income",  (SFAS 130) which establishes standards
for reporting and display of  comprehensive  income and its components in a full
set of general-purpose  financial statements. It is effective for Advent's first
quarter of fiscal year 1998.

    In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise  and Related  Information",  (SFAS 131) which  changes  current
practice under SFAS 14 by  establishing a new framework on which to base segment
reporting  (referred to as the "management"  approach) and also requires interim
reporting of segment  information.  It is effective for Advent's fiscal year-end
1998.

    In October  1997,  the AICPA  issued  Statement  of  Position  (SOP) 97-2 on
Software Revenue Recognition which supersedes SOP 91-1. The SOP is effective for
all fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 1997 and will be effective  for
Advent's fiscal year 1998.

                                      -13-
<PAGE>



    Advent will be studying the  implications of these standards and has not yet
determined the impact of their implementation on Advent's financial statements.

    USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and  assumptions  that affect  reported  amounts.  These  estimates are based on
information available as of the date of the financial statements.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.


2. Acquisitions

    In February  1996,  Advent  acquired Data Exchange,  Inc. (the DX Group),  a
private company based in New York, for $4.0 million in cash and an $800,000 note
payable.  This note was paid  during the third  quarter of 1996 and did not bear
interest.  The  transaction  was accounted for as a purchase.  Advent incurred a
one-time  charge of $5.6 million in connection  with the write-off of in-process
research and  development.  This expense was recorded in purchased  research and
development and other expenses.

    In November  1996,  Advent issued 35,000 shares of Advent's  common stock in
exchange for all of the  outstanding  shares of Bold  Software,  Inc., a private
software  development  company based in New York. This business  combination was
accounted  for as a pooling  of  interests.  Prior  year  amounts  have not been
restated to include Bold  Software's  results of operations  as such  operations
were immaterial.  As a result of this business  combination,  Advent  introduced
Advent  Partner,  a tax  layering  and  partnership  allocation  solution  which
integrates with Axys.

   401(k) Plan

    Advent  has a  401(k)  deferred  savings  plan  covering  substantially  all
employees. Employee contributions,  limited to 15% of compensation,  are matched
50% by  Advent,  up to a  maximum  of  $500  per  employee  per  year.  Matching
contributions  by Advent  in 1997,  1996 and 1995 were  $103,000,  $73,000,  and

Directors.  Advent made profit sharing  contributions of $121,000,  $87,000, and
$92,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

   1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

    All  individuals  employed  by Advent are  eligible  to  participate  in the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase  Plan) if they are employed by Advent for
at least 20 hours per week and at least five months per year.  The Purchase Plan
permits  eligible  employees to purchase  Advent's  common stock through payroll
deductions  at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the  closing  sale price for
Advent's  common stock reported on the Nasdaq  National  Market at the beginning
and the end of each six-month  offering period.  In any calendar year,  eligible
employees  can  withhold  up  to  10%  of  their  salary  and  certain  variable
compensation.  A total of 100,000  shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance under the Purchase  Plan. In 1997,  38,000 shares were sold through the
Purchase Plan.

8. Stockholders' Equity

   Common Stock

    On November 15,  1995,  Advent  completed an IPO in which it sold  1,450,000
shares of its common stock at $18.00 per share which  generated  net proceeds to
Advent of $23.4  million.  Prior to the effective  date of Advent's IPO,  Advent
reincorporated  in the state of Delaware and exchanged each outstanding share of
no par common stock for one share of $0.01 par value common stock.

   Stock Options

    Under  Advent's  1992  Stock Plan (the  Plan)  Advent  may grant  options to
purchase  common  stock to employees  and  consultants.  Options  granted may be
incentive stock options or nonstatutory  stock options and shall be granted at a
price not less than fair market  value on the date of grant.  Fair market  value
(as defined in the Plan) and the vesting of these options shall be determined by
the Board of Directors.  The options expire no later than 10 years from the date
of grant.  Unvested  options on  termination  of  employment  are  canceled  and
returned to the Plan.

    The activity under the Plan was as follows:

    Of the 1,590,000  options under the Plan  outstanding  at December 31, 1997,
331,000 options were exercisable with an aggregate exercise price of $3,190,000.

    In addition to the Plan, Advent had granted options to purchase common stock
to employees or consultants  under special  arrangements.  These options have an
exercise price of $1.00 per share. There were 10,000, 12,000 and 16,000 of these
options  outstanding  at December 31,  1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively.  The
change in each period was a result of the  exercise  of 2,000 and 4,000  options
during 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The shares outstanding at December 31, 1997
are fully vested.

    Advent's 1995  Director  Option Plan (the  Director  Plan)  provides for the
grant of nonstatutory stock options to nonemployee  directors of Advent (Outside
Directors).  Under  the  Director  Plan,  each  Outside  Director  is  granted a
non-qualified  option to purchase 10,000 shares on the last to occur of the date
of  effectiveness  of the Director Plan or the date upon which such person first
becomes a director  with an exercise  price  equal to the fair  market  value of
Advent's  common stock as of the date of the grant.  In subsequent  years,  each
Outside Director is automatically  granted an option to purchase 2,000 shares on
December 1 with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the Advent's common
stock on that date.  Options  granted  under the Director  Plan vest over a five
year period and have a ten year term.

    The activity under the Director Plan was as follows:

    Of the 48,000  options under the Director Plan  outstanding  at December 31,
1997,  8,300  options  were  exercisable  with an  aggregate  exercise  price of
$150,000.

    In addition to the Director Plan, Advent granted options prior to 1994 to an
Outside  Director  for the  purchase  of 96,000  shares of common  stock with an
exercise price of $0.63 per share. These options were exercised during 1996.

    At December 31, 1997,  Advent had reserved  2,363,000 shares of common stock
for the exercise of stock options.

    Advent  has  adopted  the  disclosure-only   provisions  of  SFAS  No.  123.
Accordingly,  no compensation cost has been recognized for Advent's stock option
plans.  Had  compensation  cost been  determined  based on the fair value at the
grant date for awards in 1997,  1996 and 1995  consistent with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123, Advent's net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share for the
year ended December 31, 1997,  1996 and 1995,  respectively,  would have been as
follows:

                                                   1997        1996       1995

Net income (loss) - as reported                   $6,713      $(1,099)    $2,819

    Such pro forma disclosures may not be representative of future  compensation
cost because options vest over several years and additional grants are made each
year.

    The  weighted-average  grant-date fair value of options granted were $14.50,
$14.50,  and $3.82 per option for the years ended  December 31,  1997,  1996 and
1995, respectively.

    The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the   Black-Scholes   valuation  model  with  the  following   weighted  average
assumptions:

                                     1997          1996         1995

Risk-free interest rate              5.99%           6.03%       6.40%
Volatility                           56.91         55.04        55.04

Expected dividends                   None          None         None

    The risk-free interest rate was calculated in accordance with the grant date
and expected life. Volatility was calculated using an analysis of an Advent peer
group of publicly  traded  companies.  The weighted  average  expected  life was
calculated  based  on the  vesting  period  and  the  exercise  behavior  of the
participants.

9. Subsequent Event (unaudited)

    In February 1998,  Advent issued 250,000 shares of Advent's  common stock in
exchange  for all of the  outstanding  shares  of  MicroEdge,  Inc.,  a  private
software  development  company  based  in New  York.  MicroEdge  is the  leading
provider  of  software   products  to   foundations,   corporations   and  other
organizations to manage their grant-making activities. This business combination
was accounted  for as a pooling of interests.  The results of operations as well
as the assets and liabilities of MicroEdge in 1997 and 1996 were not material to
the consolidated results of operations or financial position of Advent.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors
Advent Software, Inc.:

    We have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Advent
Software,  Inc.  as of December  31, 1997 and 1996 and the related  consolidated
statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1997.  These  financial  statements
are the responsibility of Advent Software, Inc.'s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion,  the financial  statements referred to above present fairly,
in  all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  financial  position  of  Advent
Software,  Inc. as of December 31, 1997 and 1996 and the consolidated results of
its  operations  and its cash  flows for each of the three  years in the  period
ended  December  31,  1997 in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

    We are a leading provider of Enterprise Investment Management solutions that
automate and integrate mission-critical functions of investment management
organizations through software products, services and data integration. Our
solutions enable organizations of all sizes to run their business more
effectively, enhance client service and performance, and improve productivity
and communication throughout their organization.

    Advent Office(TM), our suite of integrated products, addresses the demand to
automate the entire range of investment management functions, including
portfolio management, client relationship management, trade order management,
data warehousing, partnership accounting, reconciliation management, and
web-based portfolio, performance and analytic reporting. Advent Office contains
Axys(R), Moxy(R), Advent Partner(R), REX(TM), Advent Custodial Data(TM) , Advent
Warehouse(R) , Qube(R), MyAdvent(TM), Advent Browser Reporting(R) , and Advent
Corporate Actions(TM).

    We were founded in 1983, incorporated in 1983 in California and
reincorporated in Delaware in November 1995. Our principal executive offices are
located at 301 Brannan Street, San Francisco, California 94107, and our
telephone number is (415) 543-7696.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND AND OUR CLIENTS

    Our clients include a range of organizations that manage investment
portfolios, including investment advisors, brokerage firms, banks and hedge
funds. Our clients also include corporations, public funds, foundations,
universities and non-profit organizations that manage investment portfolios and
perform similar portfolio management functions. Over the past decade, the
investment management industry has experienced significant growth, which, in
combination with other factors, has led to increasing demand for software
products that automate, simplify and integrate functions within investment
management organizations. This increasing demand is driven by several industry
dynamics. Financial assets under management have increased substantially during
the last decade. As the value of total financial assets under management has
increased, there has been a substantial increase in the number of investment
management organizations and a steady introduction of increasingly sophisticated
financial instruments. As a result, investment managers are faced with
increasingly complicated portfolio accounting and management requirements as
well as extensive and evolving industry standards and government regulations.

                                       2
<PAGE>

    These dynamics have increased the volume and complexity of information and
data flows within investment management organizations and between such
organizations and third parties, such as brokerage firms, clients, custodians,
banks, pricing services and other data providers. Consequently, in order to
operate efficiently, investment management organizations must automate and
integrate their mission-critical and labor-intensive functions, including (i)
investment decision support and client relationship management, (ii) order
management and trading and (iii) portfolio accounting, performance measurement,
report generation and compliance. Investment management organizations
historically have relied on internally developed systems, timesharing services
or simple spreadsheet-based systems to manage information flows. Due to inherent
limitations in each of these types of systems, investment management
organizations are demanding highly functional, easy-to-use, scalable,
cost-effective and flexible software applications that automate and integrate
their mission-critical business functions.

THE ADVENT SOLUTION

    The Advent solution combines a fully integrated suite of client-centric
software products, with a full range of professional services - from
implementation management and training to technical support and consulting
services, all aimed at accomplishing our clients' business objectives.

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

    We offer an integrated suite of software products for automating and
integrating data and work flows across the investment management organization,
as well as the information flows between the investment management organization
and external parties. Our products are intended to reduce client costs, improve
the accuracy of client information and generally enable clients to improve the
service they provide to their customers rather than focusing on operational
details. Each software component in the Advent Office suite focuses on certain
mission-critical functions of the investment management organization. Each
Advent Office implementation is tailored to meet the needs of a particular
client, as determined by size, assets under management and complexity of the
investment environment.

    We believe that our Enterprise Investment Management solution is well suited
for the investment management functions of advisors, banks, brokerages,
corporations, public funds, partnerships, foundations, universities and
non-profit organizations. An Enterprise Investment Management solution is an
evolutionary process that encompasses three phases:

o    Investment Process Integration - investment management organizations must
     integrate their mission-critical and labor-intensive functions, including
     (i) investment decision support and client relationship management, (ii)
     order management and trading and (iii) portfolio accounting, performance
     measurement, report generation and compliance with each other as well as
     with standard productivity applications such as Microsoft Word,(R)
     Outlook(R) and Excel(R). This integration eliminates ineffective
     communication between processes and minimizes processing errors, enabling
     growth by reducing bottlenecks within the organization.

o    Data Collection and Reconciliation - enables the investment organization to
     integrate the external data regarding pricing and settlements so that the
     firm can quickly and efficiently settle transactions and monitor
     performance in an automated fashion.

o    Customer Responsiveness - incorporates numerous capabilities enabling our
     clients to provide more personal, effective communication with their
     customers. This capability enables decision makers for the firm to have
     timely access to information in order to make more effective decisions on
     behalf of the clients.

    We offer three portfolio accounting and management applications: Axys,
Advent Partner and Geneva(R).. We also offer additional complimentary
applications, including our REX solution, which provides reconciliation
management, and our Advent Warehouse solution, which provides data warehousing
capabilities.

         AXYS, our core application, introduced in 1993, is a highly functional
portfolio accounting and management system targeted towards investment
management organizations of all sizes. Axys provides investment professionals
with broad portfolio accounting functionality, timely decision support,
sophisticated performance measurement and flexible reporting. Specifically,
clients can record, account for and report on a variety of investment
instruments, including equities, fixed income, mutual funds and cash. Axys users
gain access on demand to portfolio holdings, asset allocation, realized and
unrealized gains and losses, actual and projected income and other valuable
data. Portfolio performance can be measured for individual portfolios or related
groups, and for any specified time period. Investment professionals can choose
from over 200 pre-defined reports with flexible "as-of" reporting, which can be
customized as to formats and fonts. Clients can easily generate fully customized
reports with the

                                       3
<PAGE>

assistance of the Axys Report Writer. Clients can also produce
presentation-quality graphics via an integrated link with Microsoft Excel's
charting capability. In addition, Axys offers integrated multi-currency
capabilities which, among other things, allows reports to be restated in any
currency, tracks reclaimable foreign withholding tax, and can identify
components of return attributable to market prices versus currency rate
fluctuations.

         Axys also provides integration with a variety of investment tools and
data. These tools include (i) Moxy, our trade order management solution, (ii)
pricing, corporate actions, analytics and fundamental data via interfaces to
data vendors, (iii) automatic data entry and reconciliation of trades with
interfaces to the Depository Trust Corporation ("DTC"), brokerage firms and
custodians, (iv) integrating through the internet via our custodial data service
and software and (vi) internet reporting via Advent Browser Reporting for
Enterprise Users, our internet reporting service.

         ADVENT PARTNER, introduced in December 1996, is an investment
partnership allocation solution, which integrates with Axys. This product is
specifically designed for hedge funds, venture funds and limited investment
partnerships that face the complex and time-consuming task of consistently and
accurately accounting for and reporting on partnership tax allocation and other
activities. The Windows-based system tracks partner-specific information,
handles the complexities of allocating realized and unrealized gains and losses
for tax purposes, allocates performance incentive fees, provides on-demand
partner and partnership reporting on an economic or tax allocation basis and
streamlines the production of partnership tax returns.

         GENEVA, introduced to target organizations in 1995 and made
commercially available in October 1997, is a high-end portfolio accounting
system designed to meet the needs of large, global investment management
organizations with complex, international accounting requirements. Geneva offers
feature-rich global accounting, extensive reporting (including profit and loss
reporting by strategy) and sophisticated multi-currency capabilities. In
addition, Geneva's highly flexible design allows users to add newly created
financial instruments and tailor accounting treatments to their specific needs.

         REX, introduced in 1997, is the Advent Office solution for
reconciliation management. REX is integrated with Axys and is designed for firms
that want to electronically reconcile their Axys information against their
custodial information. REX works in conjunction with Advent Custodial Data(TM)
and automates matching and helps users identify exceptions, correct or add
transactions to their portfolios or communicate and track changes required by
their custodian.

           ADVENT CUSTODIAL DATA (ACD), introduced in 1997, provides data from a
firm's custodians in a single, secure account at Advent. Advent Custodial Data
then electronically feeds all this information into Advent Office(TM), which
allows a firm to further process the data against their own records.

         ADVENT WAREHOUSE, introduced in 1998, is a data warehouse solution
designed to allow investment professionals to readily access investment data
regardless of how the data was created or maintained, without impacting the
performance of their high volume transaction-based Advent Office systems.
Relational technology and data warehousing tools provide an open environment for
ad hoc decision support and customized reporting on enterprise wide investment
information. Investment professionals can take advantage of the sea of
information captured during the investment process to improve client service and
gain competitive advantage.

         ADVENT INX(TM), introduced in 2001, is a development toolkit for
on-demand delivery of portfolio information and derived data. Advent INX is a
solution intended for high-volume investor oriented websites and large internal
integration projects.

         ADVENT REPORT CENTER(TM), launched in 2001, leverages Advent Warehouse
to generate distinctive investor reports. It is a scalable solution designed to
produce personalized, period-end statements tailored for different investor
profiles and integrating third party data elements. Investment firms can
customize their report output with their own characteristics and marketing
message.

         ADVENT CORPORATE ACTIONS, introduced in May 1999, is a comprehensive,
integrated corporate actions solution from our subsidiary, Hub Data, and is
designed to integrate with Axys to automate and simplify the process of manually
tracking and processing corporate actions. Advent Corporate Actions
electronically tracks and consolidates corporate action information from a host
of high-quality sources and delivers daily e-mail reports to portfolio managers
and other key staff.

         ADVENT OUTSOURCE(SM), introduced in September 2000, is a service that
brings our portfolio reporting solution to investment firms in an application
service provider ("ASP") model. Investment management firms that wish to
outsource the management of their portfolio reporting will be able to leverage
the full power of Axys, our portfolio accounting, management

                                       4
<PAGE>

and reporting solution. Investment firms that choose Advent Outsource will have
their client data housed for them and will be provided secure access over the
internet to their accounts. This ASP solution is especially attractive to firms
that may not have the resources required to maintain technology operations
in-house or are looking specifically to outsource all of their data management.
Advent Outsource is provided by an independent company using Advent's
technology.

        Additionally, Advent licenses tax modules specifically for certain
European countries These modules, released in 1999, extract portfolio data from
Axys and combine it with additional tax factors provided by tax authorities to
calculate local taxes and deductions, and generate the formal tax forms.

         MOXY, introduced in 1995, automates and streamlines the trading and
order management process. Moxy facilitates accurate trade order management and
preparation, tracks trade-order status, automates the allocation of block trades
across multiple portfolios and electronically interfaces with Axys to provide an
integrated solution. Moxy supports fixed income, mutual funds and equity trading
and offers multi-currency capabilities. Moxy enables investment managers to
accurately adjust portfolio holdings, rebalance portfolios against models,
interactively assess "what-if" scenarios and automatically create orders to be
executed. For traders, Moxy tracks cash and positions during the trading day,
enables the accurate preparation of block trades and internal electronic trade
tickets, facilitates compliance with investment restrictions and trading
requirements and minimizes trading errors. Moxy also allows traders and others
to view the status of orders via customizable screens and maintain an electronic
audit trail of the trade process. Moxy automates the allocation process of
partial and complete executions and allows the user to send allocation results
using OASYS, an electronic allocation system, to communicate allocations to
brokers electronically. Moxy also provides internet-ready electronic order
routing based on the industry standard FIX messaging protocol so that Moxy users
can route trades electronically to any FIX-compliant broker or crossing network
that supports the internet or other TCP/IP connections. Moxy users can choose to
route equity orders via SunGard Direct(TM) which links them to participating
brokers and execution venues. Trades are executed, processed, settled and
accounted for without manual intervention. Moxy electronically posts allocated
trades into Axys on demand, eliminating time-consuming and error-prone manual
entry.

         QUBE, introduced in 1995, is designed to help securities professionals
develop and improve client relationships by automating scheduling, client
communications and client data. For example, Qube integrates with portfolio
information on Axys and enables investment professionals to interactively screen
client investment profiles and notes of conversations to identify appropriate
candidates for various investment opportunities. In addition, Qube can be used
to enhance direct marketing campaigns by matching clients with market
opportunities. Qube captures extensive investment profile information, has
online query capability, networking features and mail merge capabilities and
facilitates information sharing across professionals in an office.

         MYADVENT, introduced in May 2000 provides a browser-based portal to
Advent Office for investment professionals to quickly view summary information
they need in one place in order to know exactly where they stand at any point in
the day. Users are able to review information then immediately drill down into
detailed data and functionality in other Advent Office components, and in Advent
Alliance Partner applications.

         ADVENT BROWSER REPORTING(R) FOR DECISION MAKERS, introduced in 1998,
puts the power of data analysis on the portfolio managers' desktop via the
internet. Using our Online Analytical Processing tools (OLAP), investment data
can be sliced and diced to improve the decision making process. ADVENT BROWSER
REPORTING FOR INVESTORS, also introduced in 1998, allows investment managers to
post Axys reports to a secure website where their clients can access these
reports 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. ADVENT BROWSER REPORTING FOR ENTERPRISE
USERS allows investment professionals the ability to access Axys from remote
locations via the internet and run Axys reports as if they were in their office.

         ADVENT TRUSTEDNETWORK(R), introduced in March 2000, is an automated
account consolidation solution that enables financial institutions to use the
internet to deliver cross-institutional, consolidated views of individual
investor portfolios. The investment advisors can provide a consolidated
statement showing the individual investor's portfolio of assets, transaction
data (buys, sells, interest, dividends, deposits and withdrawals), performance
analysis and other detailed account information. The data can be manipulated and
new data interpolated from it. The consolidated information can then be shared
simultaneously between investors and trusted financial advisors. Our solution,
in contrast to account aggregation solutions, is designed to employ our data
gathering and reporting tools to accept account and transactional information
from bank and brokerage back office systems, aggregate those transactions by
investor, and deliver the information to participating institutions and their
clients online.

         WEALTHLINE(SM), announced in November 2001, is a secure,
private-labeled hosted investor-facing website offered through a partnership
between Advent & Microsoft. Through the integration of Advent's software
solutions and Advent TrustedNetwork data service with Microsoft's .Net
FinancialAdvisor, advisors can provide investors content and tools, such

                                       5
<PAGE>

as Axys holdings dynamically tied to market data services, Axys reports and
graphs, consolidated portfolio holdings, aggregation of checking, savings, and
credit card balances, propriety research and information, as well as stock and
mutual fund quotes, charts, and news. The service also allows personal
communication between the advisor and investor. Microsoft's .Net
FinancialAdvisor is a Web-based service built for professional financial
advisors that offers the customer communications tools they need most by
combining .NET My Services (Passport, notifications, etc.) with secure document
publishing, portfolio reporting, and financial content.

         GIFTS(R) FOR WINDOWS is a proposal tracking and grants management
system that allows the user to retrieve and classify requests, generate
personalized letters, manage contacts, schedule and monitor activities, maintain
complete organization history, track payments, contingencies and report
requests. This software is primarily used by the philanthropic community such as
foundations, corporations and other organizations to manage their grant-making
activities. The Internet Grant Application Module (IGAM) allows grant seekers to
submit online grant applications and facilitates more efficient communication
between everyone involved in the initial review process, and GIFTS Connections,
an internet suite of modules including MyGIFTS, ReviewerConnnect,
GranteeConnect, and EmployeeConnect, that enables Web browser access to
personalized relevant information for anyone involved in the grant making
process, from any location.

         FIMS(TM) is a modular, integrated information management system for
nonprofit organizations. Modules include Profiles (Communications), Gifts
(Fundraising/Development), Grants, Accounts Payable, General Ledger (Fund
Accounting and Portfolio Balancing) and FACTS (Pooled Investment Allocation),
united in a single database.

         FOUNDATIONPOWER(TM) is a Windows based customized information
management application for nonprofit organizations. Because each system is
customized to only one foundation, it reflects the procedures, policies and
nomenclature at each organization.


MAINTENANCE SUPPORT AND SUBSCRIPTION-BASED/TRANSACTION-BASED SERVICES

    We earn recurring revenues by offering a choice of maintenance contracts and
by providing subscription-based and transaction-based services. Our
subscription-based and transaction-based services allow clients to (1) download
pricing, corporate actions and other data from third party vendors such as
Interactive Data Corporation ("Interactive Data"), a wholly owned indirect
subsidiary of Pearson plc, and (2) interface with DTC, certain brokerage firms
and custodians for trading activity. Many of our clients use our proprietary
interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data from Interactive
Data. Interactive Data pays us a commission based on Interactive Data's revenues
from providing such data to our clients.

    Our Hub Data subsidiary consolidates securities information and data from
various third party providers such as Merrill Lynch, Interactive Data, J.J.
Kenny, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Xcitek, CCH Incorporated,
Telekurs and others, and provides data feeds and services to a range of
financial institutions via electronic interfaces to many portfolio software
systems.

    Due to the mission-critical nature of our products, many clients purchase
annual maintenance contracts, which entitle them to technical support and
product upgrades as they become available. We continually upgrade and enhance
our products to respond to changing market needs, evolving regulatory
requirements and new technologies.

INTERNET CAPABILITIES

    The internet has proven to be a low-cost communications platform for
integrating external information into our products, thereby providing our
clients with straight through processing ("STP") of business information. To
take advantage of the internet, Advent continues to develop capabilities that
bring internet-based products and services to our clients. We launched Advent
Custodial Data (ACD), our first internet service during the second quarter of
1997. Using the internet, ACD consolidates communication and information from
all participating custodians, enabling our clients to quickly and easily
reconcile transactions and holdings with a click of the mouse. Our second
internet-based product, Advent Browser Reporting, was introduced in 1998. Advent
Browser Reporting is a reporting component of Advent Office, which enables users
to access Advent Office information through a web browser. In 1999, we
introduced Advent Corporate Actions, an enterprise-wide notification service
that automates and simplifies the process of tracking corporate actions such as
mergers, spin-offs and bankruptcies. We announced several internet-based
products and services during 2000 including: Advent Outsource, MyAdvent and
Advent TrustedNetwork. Advent Outsource brings our portfolio reporting solution
to investment firms in an ASP model. MyAdvent is a browser-based portal to the
Advent Office suite. Advent TrustedNetwork enables financial institutions to
deliver cross-institutional, consolidated views of

                                       6

individual investor portfolios across the internet. In 2001, we introduced
Advent INX, a development toolkit for on-demand delivery of portfolio
information and derived data.

    Additionally we have added Distance Learning and Advent Connection. Distance
Learning is Advent's online interactive classroom offering education services
via the internet. Now our clients can participate in an interactive education
session with a certified Advent instructor from their office or home. Advent
Connection is our client-only website which provides technical information,
support, educational offerings, discussion groups and a software center that
allows our clients to download free client reports.

    From time to time, as we begin the development of new products and services
for the internet, we plan to continue to enter into development agreements with
information providers, clients, or other companies in order to accelerate the
delivery of new products and services.

ALLIANCE PROGRAM

    Our Alliance Program was launched in May 1998 and is designed to benefit
both our clients and our partners. The program provides a formal process through
which partners can develop, promote, and sell their products, services, and
solutions in conjunction with our suite of applications. Our Alliance Program
was created to further extend our breadth of product and service offerings.

PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

    Professional services consist of consulting, implementation management,
integration management, custom report writing, and training. Many of our clients
purchase consulting services from us to support their implementations, assist in
the conversion of the clients' historical data and provide ongoing training and
education. Consulting services may be required for as little as two days for
small systems or for up to many weeks for large implementations. We believe that
consulting services facilitate a client's early success with our products,
strengthen the relationship with the client and generate valuable feedback for
us.

    Implementation management provides a single point-of-contact who will work
closely with our client's project team to plan the implementation, to optimize
the use of our products, to coordinate Advent resources, to advocate on their
behalf, and to minimize schedule delays and project risks. Additionally,
implementation managers provide documentation for the implementation from
planning through production.

    Integration management provides services to clients with multifaceted needs.
Integration managers work with clients to integrate their systems and workflows
with our products during implementation. The services include: development of
custom interfaces from back-office systems to our Axys and Moxy products,
configuration and management of large volumes of data, and strategies for
deployment of our products for distributed sites.

    We provide our clients with custom report writing services that enable
clients to tailor end-user reports to their own specifications. We also provide
training sessions to our clients at various sites across the country.
Additionally, we host semi-annual conferences in the United States, as well as
Australian and European conferences, that provide product information and user
workshops for our clients.

CLIENTS

    Our clients vary significantly in size and assets under management and
include investment advisors, brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds, corporations,
public funds, universities and non-profit organizations. At present, we have
licensed products to over 6,500 institutions in 55 countries for use by more
than 60,000 concurrent users.

SALES AND MARKETING

    We license and sell our products and services primarily through a direct
sales organization comprised of field sales and telesales representatives. Our
field sales force is organized by geographic region and is primarily responsible
for selling our suite of products to mid-sized and large investment management
organizations. We have sales offices in San Francisco, California; New York, New
York; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Sydney and Melbourne, Australia; Oslo, Norway;
Stockholm, Sweden; and Copenhagen, Denmark. Our telesales organization is
primarily focused on selling our products to existing Axys clients and small

                                       7
<PAGE>

and mid-sized investment management organizations. Our telesales representatives
are located in San Francisco, California, and New York, New York. Our sales
force is supported by extensive, ongoing product and sales training.

    Our marketing department is responsible for assessing market opportunities,
product planning and management and specific sales support. In addition to its
traditional marketing functions, our marketing organization is actively involved
in a process called "Market Validation."(SM) Market Validation uses a system of
interaction with and input from potential and existing clients, product
development, sales and client services and support departments to define the
scope, features and functionality of new products and product upgrades. In
addition, our product managers are responsible for all phases of a product life
cycle from product development through product introduction and beyond. Our
marketing department is also responsible for corporate marketing, including
generating client leads, targeted direct mail campaigns, seminars, advertising,
trade shows and conferences and public relations efforts and also provides the
sales force with appropriate written and electronic materials to use during the
sales process.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

    In recent years, we have substantially increased our product development
expenditures in order to accelerate the rate of new product introductions,
incorporate new technologies and sustain the quality of our products. In 2001,
2000, and 1999, our product development expenditures were approximately $27.4
million, $21.6 million, and $16.8 million respectively. Our product development
activities include the identification and validation of product specifications
as well as engineering, quality assurance and documentation.

    Our new products and product upgrades require varying degrees of development
time, depending upon the complexity of the accounting requirements and
securities regulations which they are intended to address, as well as the number
and type of features incorporated. To date, we have primarily relied upon the
internal development of our products. We have in the past acquired, and may
again in the future acquire, additional technologies or products from third
parties. We intend to continue to support industry standard operating
environments, client/server architectures and network protocols.

COMPETITION

    The market for investment management software is divided by the relative
size of the organizations that manage investment portfolios. The market is
intensely competitive and highly fragmented, subject to rapid change and highly
sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry
participants. Our competitors include providers of software and related services
as well as providers of timeshare services. Competitors vary in size, scope of
services offered and platforms supported. In addition, we compete indirectly
with existing and potential clients, many of whom develop their own software for
their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software
products offered by independent vendors such as Advent. With respect to the
market for our portfolio accounting products, we currently compete primarily
with Financial Models Company, Inc., Shaw Data, a division of SunGard Data
Systems, Inc.; Thomson Financial, a division of The Thomson Corporation;
Security APL, a division of Checkfree Investment Services; Performance
Technologies, a subsidiary of Charles Schwab and with a number of other
companies. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our
market include product performance and functionality, ease of use, scalability,
ability to integrate external data sources, product and company reputation,
client service and support and price. We may not compete successfully against
current and future competitors, and competitive pressures could result in price
reductions, reduced operating margins or the loss of market share.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

    Our success is dependent in part on our ability to protect our proprietary
technology. We rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade
secrets, software security measures, confidentiality agreements and license
agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights and our software. We
have registered trademarks for many of our products and services and will
continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate.
We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with
our resellers and customers. Despite these efforts, it may be possible for
unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. We do
not have any patents, and existing copyright laws afford only limited
protection. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not develop
substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or that
equivalent products will not be marketed in competition with our products,
thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. Furthermore,
confidentiality agreements between us and our employees or any license
agreements with our clients may not provide meaningful protection of our
proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure of
it. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary
rights to the same extent, as do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we
may not be able to

                                       8
<PAGE>

protect our proprietary software in the United States or abroad against
unauthorized third party copying or use, which could significantly harm our
business.

EMPLOYEES

 As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately 837 employees on a full-time
basis, including 88 in sales, 201 in professional services, 44 in marketing, 249
in product development, 129 in client services and support and 126 in finance,
administration, operations and general management. We believe that we maintain
competitive compensation, benefits, equity participation and work environment
policies to assist in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Our success
depends to a significant extent upon the continued contributions of our senior
management and other key personnel, many of who would be difficult to replace.
The loss of the service of one or more senior managers or other employees could
have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and
financial condition. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We
have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe our employee relations
are good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

 Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California where
we lease approximately 59,000 square feet under a lease that expires in 2008
with a five-year extension option; approximately 32,000 square feet under a
lease that expires in 2004 with a five-year extension option; and approximately
18,400 square feet under a lease that expires in 2005 with a five-year extension
option. We lease two separate offices in New York; approximately 30,100 square
feet under a lease that expires in 2010 with a five-year extension option and
approximately 29,000 square feet under a lease that expires in 2008 with a
five-year extension option. We also lease space (typically less than 10,000
square feet) in various geographic locations throughout the United States;
Sydney and Melbourne, Australia; Oslo, Norway; Stockholm, Sweden; and
Copenhagen, Denmark, primarily for sales and support personnel. We believe that
these facilities are adequate for our near-term needs and that suitable
additional or alternative space will be available as needed.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 From time to time we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of
our business. We are not party to any lawsuit or proceeding that, in our
opinion, is likely to seriously harm our business.

 On November 8, 2001, Charles Schwab & Co, Inc. ("Schwab") filed suit against
us alleging claims for declaratory relief, anticipatory breach of contract and
breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, arising from our
intention to cease maintenance of an existing software interface that allows
institutional investment customers to download data received from Schwab's
systems into our software product used by the investment customers. We intended
to cease maintenance of the existing interface and to transition to a new, and
what we believe to be improved, software interface (the "Advent Custodial Data"
or "ACD" system). On December 11, 2001, Schwab filed a motion for preliminary
injunction seeking to enjoin us from ceasing maintenance of the existing
interface. On December 17, 2001, we filed a motion to dismiss the action and
compel arbitration of the suit. On December 24, 2001, we filed a demurrer to
Schwab's complaint, challenging the sufficiency of the allegations in Schwab's
complaint. On January 11, 2002, the court signed an order granting Schwab's
motion for preliminary injunction and denying our request for arbitration. On
January 28, 2002, the court overruled our demurrer to Schwab's complaint and
directed Schwab to answer the complaint. The parties are currently investigating
potential avenues of resolution, and we continue to evaluate the merits of
Schwab's claims and our defenses. At this time it is too early to estimate any
potential losses from this action.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

  We have approximately 63 stockholders of record at March 11, 2002. Because
many of our shares of Common Stock are held by brokers and other institutions on
behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of
stockholders represented by these record holders. Other information required by
this Item is incorporated by reference to the sections entitled "Selected
Financial Data - Price Range of Common Stock" and "Corporate Information - Stock
Information" in our 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

  Other information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the
sections entitled "Selected Financial Data - Selected Annual Data" and "Selected
Financial Data - Selected Quarterly Data" in our 2001 Annual Report to
Stockholders.

         OF OPERATIONS

  The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the
section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" in our 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders.


RISK FACTORS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN
OUR EXISTING GROWTH RATES.

    Licenses into multi-user networked environments have increased both in
individual size and number, and the timing and size of individual license
transactions are becoming increasingly important factors in quarterly operating
results. The sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and
unpredictable. We may not be successful in closing large license transactions
such as these on a timely basis or at all. Accordingly, because revenues from
large licenses are increasing as a portion of our net revenues, the timing of
such licenses could cause additional variability in our quarterly operating
results. Software product backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically
represents only a small portion of that quarter's expected revenues. Our expense
levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and
therefore are relatively fixed in the short term. Due to the fixed nature of
these expenses combined with the relatively high gross margin historically
achieved by us on products and services, an unanticipated decline in net
revenues in any particular quarter is likely to disproportionately adversely
affect our operating results.

    We have generally realized lower revenues from license fees in the first
quarter of the year than in the last quarter of the prior year. We believe that
this has been due primarily to the concentration by some clients of larger
capital purchases in the fourth quarter of the calendar year and their lower
purchasing activity during the subsequent first quarter. We believe our annual
incentive compensation plans, which tend to produce increased year-end sales
activity, compound this factor. Furthermore, we have often recognized a
substantial portion of each quarter's license revenues in the last month, weeks
or even days of that quarter. As a result, the magnitude of quarterly
fluctuations in revenue or earnings may not be evident until late in or after
the close of a particular quarter and a disruption late in the quarter may have
a disproportionately large negative impact on our quarterly results.

    Because of the above factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons
of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these
comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.

    Our stock price has fluctuated significantly since our initial public
offering in November 1995. Like many companies in the technology and emerging
growth sector, our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations, particularly
during times of high market volatility. If net revenues or earnings in any
quarter fail to meet the investment community's expectations, our stock price is
likely to decline. In addition, our stock price may be affected by trends in the
financial service sector and by broader market trends unrelated to our
performance.

OUR SALES CYCLE IS LONG AND WE HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO FORECAST THE TIMING AND
AMOUNT OF SPECIFIC SALES.

    Because the purchase of our software products often requires significant,
executive-level investment and systems architecture decisions by prospective
customers, we must generally engage in a relatively lengthy sales effort. These
transactions may be

                                       11
<PAGE>

delayed during the customer decision process because we must provide a
significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and
benefit of our products. As a result, the sales cycle associated with the
purchase of our software products is typically between two and twelve months
depending upon the size of the client, though it can be considerably longer, and
is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no
control, including customers' budgeting constraints and internal selection
procedures, among other factors. As a result of a lengthy and unpredictable
sales cycle, we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of
specific sales. The timing of large individual sales is especially difficult to
forecast. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in
closing large license transactions on a timely basis or at all. In addition,
customers may postpone their purchases of our existing products or product
enhancements in advance of the anticipated introduction of new products or
product enhancements by us or our competitors. Because our expenses are
generally relatively fixed in the near term, any shortfall from anticipated
revenues could result in significant variations in our operating results from
quarter to quarter.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON OUR PRODUCT, AXYS.

    In 2001, 2000, and 1999, we derived a majority of our net revenues from the
licensing of Axys, part of our Advent Office suite, and related applications and
services. In addition, many of our other applications, such as Moxy, Qube and
various data interfaces were designed to operate with Axys to provide an
integrated solution. As a result, we believe that a majority of our net
revenues, for the foreseeable future, will depend upon continued market
acceptance of Axys, enhancements or upgrades to Axys and related products and
services.

WE DEPEND UPON FINANCIAL MARKETS.

    The target clients for our products include a range of organizations that
manage investment portfolios, including investment advisors, brokerage firms,
banks and hedge funds. In addition, we target corporations, public funds,
universities and non-profit organizations, which also manage investment
portfolios and have many of the same needs. The success of many of our clients
is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets. We believe that
demand for our products could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations,
disruptions, instability or downturns in the financial markets which may cause
clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay, cancel or reduce
any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software
products. In addition, a slowdown in formation of new investment firms or a
decline in the growth of assets under management would cause a decline in demand
for our products. Any resulting decline in demand for our products could have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING OUR ACQUISITIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS
AND WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS OR
DIVESTITURES.

    In 2001 we completed acquisitions of Rex Development Partners, L.P., NPO
Solutions, Inc., ManagerLink.com and our Scandinavian distributors located in
Norway, Sweden and Denmark and signed a definitive agreement to acquire Kinexus
Corporation, which acquisition was completed in February 2002. Our acquisition
of Kinexus Corporation is our largest acquisition to date, and the number of
acquisitions completed in 2001 is unprecedented for us.

The complex process of integrating Kinexus and our other acquisitions has
required and will continue to require significant resources, particularly in
light of our relative inexperience integrating acquisitions. Integrating these
acquisitions has been and will continue to be time consuming, expensive and
disruptive to our business. This integration process has strained our financial
and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures, and has resulted
in the diversion of management and financial resources from our core business
objectives. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or
to successfully integrate the operations of these entities could harm our
business, results of operations and cash flows. We may not realize the benefits
we anticipate from these acquisitions because of the following significant
challenges:

    o   expected synergy benefits from these acquisitions, such as lower costs,
        may not be realized or may be realized more slowly than anticipated,
        particularly with regard to costs associated with a reduction in
        headcount and facilities;

    o   potentially incompatible cultural differences between the companies;

    o   incorporating these companies' technologies and products into our
        current and future product lines;

    o   geographic dispersion of operations and the complexities of
        international operations;

    o   integrating the technical teams of these companies with our engineering
        organizations;

    o   generating market demand for an expanded product line;

    o   integrating the products of these companies with our business, because
        we do not have distribution, manufacturing, marketing or support
        experience for these products;

                                       12
<PAGE>

    o   the difficulty of leveraging our combined technologies and capabilities
        across all product lines and customer bases; and

    o   our inability to retain previous customers or employees of these
        entities.

We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and commit
significant management time integrating the operations, technology, development
programs, products, information systems, customers and personnel of these
acquisitions. These costs have been and will likely continue to be substantial
and include costs for:

    o   integrating and reorganizing operations, including combining teams,
        facilities and processes in various functional areas;

    o   identifying duplicative or redundant resources and facilities,
        developing plans for resource consolidation and implementing those
        plans;

    o   fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in
        completing the integration process;

    o   settling existing liabilities of these companies;

    o   uncovering through our audit process new issues reflected on the
        companies' financial statements;

    o   costs associated with vacating, subleasing and closing facilities;

    o   employee relocation, redeployment or severance costs;

    o   integrating technology and products; and

    o   other transaction costs associated with the acquisition, including
        financial advisor, attorney, accountant and exchange agent fees.

We may make additional acquisitions of complementary companies, products or
technologies in the future which would further exacerbate these issues. In
addition, we continually evaluate the performance of all our products and
product lines and may sell or discontinue current products or product lines.
Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of any future acquisition or
divestiture could also harm our business, results of operations and cash flows.
Furthermore, we may have to incur debt, write-off investments, infrastructure
costs or other assets, incur severance liabilities, write-off impaired goodwill
or other intangible assets or issue equity securities to pay for any future
acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing
stockholders' ownership. Finally, we may not identify suitable businesses to
acquire or negotiate acceptable terms for acquisitions.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES.

    We believe that the market for large management software systems may be
negatively impacted by a number of factors, including reductions in capital
expenditures by large customers; poor performance of major financial markets,
and increasing competition. Those factors may, in turn, give rise to a number of
market trends that may slow revenue growth across the industry, including longer
sales cycles, deferral or delay of information technology projects and generally
reduced expenditures for software and related services, and increased price
competition.

    If the current economic slowdown continues, the presence of these factors in
the market for large management software systems could materially adversely
affect our business and results of operations.

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

    Our operations are exposed to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss,
telecommunications failure, and other events beyond our control.

    Additionally, we are vulnerable to interruption caused by political and
terrorist incidents. Our facilities in New York were temporarily closed due to
the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Immediately after the terrorist
attacks, our clients who were located in the World Trade Center area were
concentrating on disaster recovery rather than licensing additional software
components, while the grounding of transportation impeded our ability to deliver
professional services at client sites. Additionally, during the temporary
closure of the U.S. stock markets, our clients did not use our market data
services. Such interruptions could affect our ability to sell and deliver
products and services and other critical functions of our business and could
seriously harm us. Further, such attacks could cause instability in the
financial markets upon which we depend.

    WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR INTERNET BASED PRODUCTS.

                                       13
<PAGE>

    To take advantage of the internet, we are continuing to develop services to
bring internet-based products and services to clients. As we develop these new
products and services, we have entered, and will continue to enter, into
development agreements with information providers, clients or other companies in
order to accelerate the delivery of new products and services. We may not be
successful in marketing our internet services or in developing other internet
services. Additionally, we may not be successful in being able to replace our
current technology with new technology. Our failure to do so could seriously
harm our business. In addition, we cannot assure you that there will not be
disruptions in internet services beyond our control or that of our third party
vendors. Any such disruptions could harm our business.

SECURITY RISKS AND CONCERNS MAY DETER THE USE OF THE INTERNET FOR CONDUCTING
BUSINESS.

    A significant barrier to commerce and communications over public networks is
the secure transmission of confidential information. Advances in computer
capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or
developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems or
those of other web sites to protect proprietary information. If any
well-publicized compromises of security were to occur, it could have the effect
of substantially reducing the use of the internet for commerce and
communications. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or
operations. The internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network
from many sources. In the past, computer viruses, software programs that disable
or impair computers, have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the
internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our
customers or other third parties, which could disrupt or make it inaccessible to
customers. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources
to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems
caused by breaches. To the extent that our activities may involve the storage
and transmission of proprietary information, security breaches could expose us
to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. Our security measures
may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business would be harmed
if we do not prevent them.

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO OUR NEW BUSINESS AREAS.

    We have expanded in recent periods into a number of new business areas to
foster long-term growth including international operations, strategic alliances,
and Advent TrustedNetwork. These areas are still relatively new to our product
development and sales personnel. New business areas require significant
management time and resources prior to generating significant revenues and may
divert management from our core business. There is no assurance that we will
compete effectively or will generate significant revenues in these areas. The
success of our ability to develop and market new internet based products and
services, in particular, is difficult to predict because it represents a new
area of business for our entire industry. Additionally, to help manage our
growth, we will need to continually improve our operational, financial,
management and information systems and controls.

WE EXPECT OUR GROSS AND OPERATING MARGINS MAY FLUCTUATE OVER TIME.

    We expect that our gross and operating margins may fluctuate from period to
period as we continue to introduce new products, expand our professional
services organization and associated revenue, continue to hire additional
personnel and increase other expenses to support our business. We plan our
expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. Because these
expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, a fluctuation in revenue could
lead to operating results differing from expectations.

WE MUST CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS.

    The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change,
changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards. As a result, our
future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products
or product enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and
to respond to these changing standards and practices. We may not be successful
in developing, introducing and marketing new products or product enhancements on
a timely and cost effective basis, or at all, and our new products and product
enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or
achieve market acceptance. Delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of
new products or enhancements may result in client dissatisfaction and delay or
loss of product revenues. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons,
to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a
timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client requirements,
or if new products or new versions of existing products do not achieve market
acceptance, our business would be seriously harmed. In addition, our ability to
develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of
other software vendors, including certain system software vendors, such as
Microsoft Corporation, database vendors and development tool vendors. If the
products of such vendors have design defects or flaws, or if such products are
unexpectedly delayed in their introduction, our business could be seriously
harmed. Software products as

                                       14
<PAGE>

complex as those offered by us may contain undetected defects or errors when
first introduced or as new versions are released. Although we have not
experienced adverse effects resulting from any software errors, we cannot assure
you that, despite testing by us and our clients, defects or errors will not be
found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in
loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

IF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH INTERACTIVE DATA IS TERMINATED, OUR BUSINESS MAY BE
HARMED.

    Many of our clients use our proprietary interface to electronically retrieve
pricing and other data from Interactive Data. Interactive Data pays us a
commission based on their revenues from providing this data to our clients. Our
software products have been customized to be compatible with their system and
this software would need to be redesigned if their services were unavailable for
any reason. Termination of our agreement with Interactive Data would require at
least two years notice by either us or them, or 90 days in the case of material
breach. If our relationship with Interactive Data were terminated or their
services were unavailable to our clients for any reason, replacing these
services could be costly and time consuming.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

    The market for investment management software is intensely competitive and
highly fragmented, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product
introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants. Our competitors
include providers of software and related services as well as providers of
timeshare services.

    Our competitors vary in size, scope of services offered and platforms
supported. In addition, we compete indirectly with existing and potential
clients, many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and
therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by independent
vendors like us. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and
greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do. In
addition, we also face competition from potential new entrants into our market
who may develop innovative technologies or business models. We cannot guarantee
that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future
competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in price reductions,
reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which could
seriously harm our business.

WE FACE CHALLENGES IN EXPANDING OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

    We market and sell our products in the United States and, to a lesser
extent, internationally. In November 1998, we established a subsidiary located
in Australia, Advent Australia Pty. Ltd., to market and license our products in
Australia. In addition, we entered into a distributor relationship in 1999 with
Advent Europe, an independent distributor of our products in selected European
markets. In November 2001, we acquired the Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish
companies of this independent distributor. In order to further expand our
international operations, we will need to continue to establish additional
facilities, acquire other businesses or enter into additional distribution
relationships in other parts of the world. The expansion of our existing
international operations and entry into additional international markets will
require significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be
certain that our establishment of facilities in other countries will produce
desired levels of revenue. We currently have limited experience in developing
localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products
internationally. In addition, international operations are subject to other
inherent risks, including:

      o   The impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;

      o   Greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer
          collection periods;

      o   Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

      o   Difficulties in successfully adapting our products to the language,
          regulatory and technology standards of other countries;

      o   Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;

      o   Reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some
          countries;

      o   Potentially adverse tax consequences; and

      o   Political and economic instability.


    The revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of our international
subsidiaries are primarily denominated in local currencies. We have not
historically undertaken foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover potential
foreign currency exposure. Future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may
adversely affect revenues from international sales and the U.S. dollar value of
our

                                       15
<PAGE>

foreign subsidiaries' revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Our
international revenues from our distributors are generally denominated in U.S.
dollars.

UNDETECTED SOFTWARE ERRORS OR FAILURES FOUND IN NEW PRODUCTS MAY RESULT IN LOSS
OF OR DELAY IN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR
BUSINESS.

    Our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first
introduced or as new versions are released. Despite testing by us and by current
and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products until after
commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or a delay in market
acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO
INCREASED COMPETITION THAT COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

    Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology. We
currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets,
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary
rights. We have registered trademarks for many of our products and services and
will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as
appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our
employees and with our resellers and customers. We seek to protect our software,
documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws,
which afford only limited protection. Despite these efforts, it may be possible
for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. We do
not have any patents, and existing copyright laws afford only limited
protection. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not develop
substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or that
equivalent products will not be marketed in competition with our products,
thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. We cannot
assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are
patentable, that any patent, if issued, would provide us with any competitive
advantages or would not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of
others will not adversely affect our ability to do business.

    Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology. This
litigation may be time-consuming and expensive. Despite our efforts to protect
our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our
products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In
addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights
to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. We cannot assure you
that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our
competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our
products or design around any patent that may be issued to us or other
intellectual property rights of ours.

WE MUST RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES AND RECRUIT QUALIFIED TECHNICAL AND SALES
PERSONNEL.

    We believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our
senior management and key technical personnel, none of who has an employment
agreement with us. Additionally, our continued success depends, in part, on our
ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified technical, sales and
other personnel. Because our future success is dependent on our ability to
continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are particularly dependent on
our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with
the requisite education, backgrounds and industry experience. Competition for
qualified engineers, particularly in Northern California and the San Francisco
Bay Area, is intense. The loss of the services of a significant number of our
engineers or sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or
business relationships and could seriously harm our business.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

    We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates. Much of our revenue and capital
spending is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, since the formation of our
subsidiaries in Australia and Scandinavia, whose revenues, expenses and capital
spending are transacted in local currencies, we have greater exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations. Results of operations from our international subsidiaries
are not material to our operating results; therefore, we believe that foreign
currency exchange rates should not materially adversely affect our overall
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe that the
fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be
significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to
the short-term nature of our investment portfolio. However, immediate sharp
increases in interest rates could have a material adverse affect on the fair
value of our investment portfolio. Conversely, immediate sharp declines in
interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment
portfolio.

                              ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC.

                                 2002 STOCK PLAN


      1.    PURPOSES OF THE PLAN. The purposes of this 2002 Stock Plan are:

            o     to attract and retain the best available personnel for
                  positions of substantial responsibility,

            o     to provide additional incentive to Employees, Directors and
                  Consultants, and

            o     to promote the success of the Company's business.

            Options granted under the Plan may be Incentive Stock Options or
Nonstatutory Stock Options, as determined by the Administrator at the time of
grant.

            (b)   "APPLICABLE LAWS" means the requirements relating to the
administration of stock option plans under U. S. state corporate laws, U.S.

            (d)   "CHANGE IN CONTROL" means the occurrence of any of the
                  following events:

                  (i)     Any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d)
and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power
represented by the Company's then outstanding voting securities;

                  (ii)    The consummation of the sale or disposition by the
Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets;

                  (iii)   A change in the composition of the Board occurring
within a two-year period, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the
directors are Incumbent Directors. "Incumbent Directors" means directors who
either (A) are Directors as of the effective date of the Plan, or (B) are
elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of

election of directors to the Company); or

<PAGE>

                  (iv)    The consummation of a merger or consolidation of the
Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which
would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately
prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by
being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or its parent) at
least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting
securities of the Company or such surviving entity or its parent outstanding
immediately after such merger or consolidation.

            (f)   "COMMITTEE" means a committee of Directors appointed by the

absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the
Company or between the Company, its Parent, any Subsidiary, or any successor.
For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety days,
unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or
contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the
Company is not so guaranteed, then three (3) months following the 91st day of
such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by the Optionee shall cease to be
treated as an Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a
Nonstatutory Stock Option. Neither service as a Director nor payment of a
director's fee by the Company shall be sufficient to constitute "employment" by
the Company.

            (m)   "EXCHANGE ACT" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.

            (n)   "FAIR MARKET VALUE" means, as of any date, the value of Common

exchange or a national market system, including without limitation the Nasdaq
National Market or The Nasdaq SmallCap Market of The Nasdaq Stock Market, its

grant under the Plan.

      4.    ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.

            (a)   PROCEDURE.

                  (i)   MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES. Different Committees
with respect to different groups of Service Providers may administer the Plan.

                  (ii)  SECTION 162(M). To the extent that the Administrator
determines it to be desirable to qualify Options granted hereunder as
"performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the
Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more "outside
directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.

                  (iii) RULE 16B-3. To the extent desirable to qualify
transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated
hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption under
Rule 16b-3.

                  (iv)  OTHER ADMINISTRATION. Other than as provided above, the
Plan shall be administered by (A) the Board or(B) a Committee, which committee
shall be constituted to satisfy Applicable Laws.

            (b)   POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Subject to the provisions of the
Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated
by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator shall have the authority, in
its discretion:


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

                  (i)    to determine the Fair Market Value;

                  (ii)   to select the Service Providers to whom Options may be
granted hereunder;

                  (iii)  to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be
covered by each Option granted hereunder;

                  (iv)   to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;

                  (v)    to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent
with the terms of the Plan, of any Option granted hereunder. Such terms and
conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or
times when Options may be exercised (which may be based on performance
criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and
any restriction or limitation regarding any Option or the shares of Common Stock
relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in
its sole discretion, shall determine;

                  (vi)   to reduce the exercise price of any Option to the then
current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered
by such Option shall have declined since the date the Option was granted;

                  (vii)  to institute an Option Exchange Program;

                  (viii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and
awards granted pursuant to the Plan;

                  (ix)   to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations
relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans
established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws;

                  (x)    to modify or amend each Option (subject to Section
14(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority to extend the
post-termination exercisability period of Options longer than is otherwise
provided for in the Plan;

                  (xi)   to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax
obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be
issued upon exercise of an Option that number of Shares having a Fair Market
Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value
of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of
tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by an Optionee to have
Shares withheld for this purpose shall be made in such form and under such
conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;

                  (xii)  to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the
Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Option previously
granted by the Administrator; and

                  (xiii) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or
advisable for administering the Plan.


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

            (c)   EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATOR'S DECISION. The Administrator's
decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all
Optionees and any other holders of Options.

      5.    ELIGIBILITY. Nonstatutory Stock Options may be granted to Service
Providers. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees.

      6.    LIMITATIONS.

            (a)   Each Option shall be designated in the Option Agreement as
either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However,
notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market
Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are
exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under
all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such
Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this
Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order
in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be
determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.

            (b)   Neither the Plan nor any Option shall confer upon an Optionee
any right with respect to continuing the Optionee's relationship as a Service
Provider with the Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the
Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any
time, with or without cause.

            (c)   The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options:

                  (i)    No Service Provider shall be granted, in any fiscal
year of the Company, Options to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares.

                  (ii)   In connection with his or her initial service, a
Service Provider may be granted Options to purchase up to an additional
1,000,000 Shares, which shall not count against the limit set forth in
subsection (i) above.

                  (iii)  The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted
proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as
described in Section 12.


                  (iv)   If an Option is cancelled in the same fiscal year of
the Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction
described in Section 12), the cancelled Option will be counted against the
limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the
exercise price of an Option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a
cancellation of the Option and the grant of a new Option.

      7.    TERM OF PLAN. Subject to Section 18 of the Plan, the Plan shall
become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall continue in effect for
a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 14 of the Plan.

      8.    TERM OF OPTION. The term of each Option shall be stated in the
Option Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term shall be
ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in
the Option Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Incentive
Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of
the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any
Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option shall be five (5)
years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the
Option Agreement.

      9.    OPTION EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.

            (a)   EXERCISE PRICE. The per share exercise price for the Shares to
be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the
Administrator, subject to the following:

                  (i)    In the case of an Incentive Stock Option

                         (A)   granted to an Employee who, at the time the
Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent
(10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent
or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the
Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

                         (B)   granted to any Employee other than an Employee
described in paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall
be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.

                  (ii)   In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per
Share exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a
Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based
compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share
exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on
the date of grant.

                  (iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted
with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per
Share on the date of grant pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.

            (b)   WAITING PERIOD AND EXERCISE DATES. At the time an Option is
granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be
exercised and shall determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the
Option may be exercised.

            (c)   FORM OF CONSIDERATION. The Administrator shall determine the
acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method
of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall
determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such
consideration may consist entirely of:

                  (i)   cash;

                  (ii)  check;

                  (iii) promissory note;


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

                  (iv)   other Shares which, in the case of Shares acquired
directly or indirectly from the Company, (A) have been owned by the Optionee for
more than six (6) months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market
Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the
Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised;

                  (v)    consideration received by the Company under a cashless
exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;

                  (vi)   a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to
the Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's
participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or
arrangement;

                  (vii)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or

                  (viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the
issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

      10.   EXERCISE OF OPTION.

            (a)   PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A STOCKHOLDER. Any Option
granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at
such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set
forth in the Option Agreement. Unless the Administrator provides otherwise,
vesting of Options granted hereunder shall be suspended during any unpaid leave
of absence. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

                  An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives:
(i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option
Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full
payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full
payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the
Administrator and permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued
upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Optionee or, if
requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his or her spouse.
Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books
of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right
to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist
with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.
The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the
Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right
for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as
provided in Section 12 of the Plan.

                  Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number
of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under
the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.


            (b)   TERMINATION OF RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER. If an
Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Optionee's death
or Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option within such period of
time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent that the Option is
vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of
the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). In the absence of
a specified time in the

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months
following the Optionee's termination. If, on the date of termination, the
Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the
unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination,
the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by
the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such
Option shall revert to the Plan.

            (c)   DISABILITY OF OPTIONEE. If an Optionee ceases to be a Service
Provider as a result of the Optionee's Disability, the Optionee may exercise his
or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement
to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event
later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option
Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the
Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Optionee's
termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not vested as to
his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the
Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not
exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall
terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

            (d)   DEATH OF OPTIONEE. If an Optionee dies while a Service
Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Optionee's death within such
period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement to the extent that the
Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the option be
exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in
the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's designated beneficiary, provided such
beneficiary has been designated prior to Optionee's death in a form acceptable
to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the
Optionee, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of
the Optionee's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred
pursuant to the Optionee's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and
distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the
Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Optionee's
death. If, at the time of death, Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire
Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall
immediately revert to the Plan. If the Option is not so exercised within the
time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by
such Option shall revert to the Plan.

      11.   TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS. Unless determined otherwise by the
Administrator, an Option may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated,
transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of
descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the
Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the Administrator makes an Option
transferable, such Option shall contain such additional terms and conditions as
the Administrator deems appropriate.

      12.   ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, MERGER OR CHANGE IN
            CONTROL.

            (a)   CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION. Subject to any required action by
the stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock that have
been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options have yet
been granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or
expiration of an Option, the number of Shares that may be added annually to the
Plan pursuant to Section 3(i) and the number of shares of Common Stock as well
as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each such outstanding Option,
shall be proportionately

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common
Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or
decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt
of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any
convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected
without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board,
whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of
stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class,
shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to,
the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option.

            (b)   DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION. In the event of the proposed
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each
Optionee as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed
transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for an Optionee to
have the right to exercise his or her Option until ten (10) days prior to such
transaction as to all of the Optioned Stock covered thereby, including Shares as
to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the
Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option applicable to any
Shares purchased upon exercise of an Option shall lapse as to all such Shares,
provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in
the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an
Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed
action.

            (c)   MERGER OR CHANGE IN CONTROL. In the event of a merger of the
Company with or into another corporation, or a Change in Control, each
outstanding Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the
successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.

                  In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume
or substitute for the Option, the Optionee shall fully vest in and have the
right to exercise the Option as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares
as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If an Option
becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in
the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the
Optionee in writing or electronically that the Option shall be fully vested and
exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and
the Option shall terminate upon the expiration of such period.

                  For the purposes of this subsection (c), the Option shall be
considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the option
confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned Stock
subject to the Option immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the
consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in
the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held
on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice
of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration
received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the
successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of
the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the
exercise of the Option, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option,
to be solely common stock of the successor

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share
consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in
Control.

      13.   DATE OF GRANT. The date of grant of an Option shall be, for all
purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting
such Option, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator.
Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Optionee within a
reasonable time after the date of such grant.

      14.   AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.

            (a)   AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. The Board may at any time amend,
alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.

            (b)   STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. The Company shall obtain stockholder
approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply
with Applicable Laws.

            (c)   EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION. No amendment, alteration,
suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Optionee,
unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator,
which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company.
Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise
the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options granted under the
Plan prior to the date of such termination.

      15.   CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES.

            (a)   LEGAL COMPLIANCE. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the
exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and
delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further
subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such
compliance.

            (b)   INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS. As a condition to the exercise of
an Option, the Company may require the person exercising such Option to
represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being
purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or
distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a
representation is required.

      16.   INABILITY TO OBTAIN AUTHORITY. The inability of the Company to
obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority
is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and
sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in
respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite
authority shall not have been obtained.

      17.   RESERVATION OF SHARES. The Company, during the term of this Plan,
will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

degree required under Applicable Laws.

      20.  AGREEMENT

            (a)   Grant of Option.

            The Plan Administrator of the Company hereby grants to the Optionee
named in the Notice of Grant attached as Part I of this Agreement (the
"Optionee") an option (the "Option") to purchase the number of Shares, as set
forth in the Notice of Grant, at the exercise price per share set forth in the
Notice of Grant (the "Exercise Price"), subject to the terms and conditions of
the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 14(c) of
the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the
Plan and the terms and conditions of this Option Agreement, the terms and
conditions of the Plan shall prevail.

            If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive Stock Option
("ISO"), this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under
Section 422 of the Code. However, if this Option is intended to be an Incentive
Stock Option, to the extent that it exceeds the $100,000 rule of Code Section
422(d) it shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option ("NSO").

            (b)   Exercise of Option.

                        (A)   RIGHT TO EXERCISE. This Option is exercisable
during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice of
Grant and the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement.

                        (B)   METHOD OF EXERCISE. This Option is exercisable by
delivery of an exercise notice, in the form attached as EXHIBIT A (the "Exercise
Notice"), which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of
Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised (the "Exercised
Shares"), and such other representations and agreements as may be required by
the Company pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Exercise Notice shall be
completed by the Optionee and delivered to Secretary of the Company. The
Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price
as to all Exercised Shares. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon
receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by
such aggregate Exercise Price.

                     No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of this
Option unless such issuance and exercise complies with Applicable Laws. Assuming
such compliance, for income tax purposes the Exercised Shares shall be
considered transferred to the Optionee on the date the Option is exercised with
respect to such Exercised Shares.

                        (ii)  check; or

formal cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with

                        (iv)  surrender of other Shares which (i) in the case of
Shares acquired either directly or indirectly from the Company, have been owned
by the Optionee for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender, and (ii)
have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate
Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares; or

                        (v)   a reduction in the amount of any Company liability
to the Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's
participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or
arrangement.

            (d)   Non-Transferability of Option.

            This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by
will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the
lifetime of Optionee only by the Optionee. The terms of the Plan and this Option
Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors
and assigns of the Optionee.

            (e)   Term of Option.

            This Option may be exercised only within the term set out in the

                          (A)   WITHHOLDING TAXES. Optionee agrees to make
appropriate arrangements with the Company (or the Parent or Subsidiary employing
or retaining Optionee) for the satisfaction of all Federal, state, local and
foreign income and employment tax withholding requirements applicable to the
Option exercise. Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to
honor the exercise and refuse to deliver Shares if such withholding amounts are
not delivered at the time of exercise.

                          (B)   NOTICE OF DISQUALIFYING DISPOSITION OF ISO
SHARES. If the Option granted to Optionee herein is an ISO, and if Optionee
sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Shares acquired pursuant to the ISO on
or before the later of (1) the date two years after the Date of Grant, or (2)
the date one year after the date of exercise, the Optionee shall immediately
notify the

                                      -14-

subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation income

            (g)   Entire Agreement; Governing Law.

            The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. The Plan and this
Option Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings
and agreements of the Company and Optionee with respect to the subject matter

means of a writing signed by the Company and Optionee. This agreement is
governed by the internal substantive laws, but not the choice of law rules, of
California.

            (h)   NO GUARANTEE OF CONTINUED SERVICE.

            OPTIONEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT
TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE
PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (AND NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED,

        SELECTED PORTIONS OF ADVENT'S 2001 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS

           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
                           AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

       We are a leading provider of stand-alone and client/server software
products, data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate,
integrate and support mission-critical functions of investment management
organizations. Our clients vary significantly in size and assets under
management and include investment advisors, brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds,
corporations, public funds, universities and non-profit organizations.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

       Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments,
including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets,
intangible assets and goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

       We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION - We recognize revenue from the license of software when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered,
the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is
reasonably assured. We use a signed license agreement as evidence of an
arrangement. Sales through our distributor are evidenced by a master agreement
governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed
contracts from the distributor's customers. Delivery occurs when product is
delivered to a common carrier F.O.B shipping point. Our arrangements do not
generally include acceptance provisions, yet if acceptance provisions are
provided, delivery occurs upon acceptance. We assess whether the fee is fixed
and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction.
Fees are fixed and determinable when we have sufficient history of collection
under the payment terms. We determine whether collection of the fee is
reasonably assured based on a number of factors, including past transaction
history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. Our
arrangements for software licenses are sold with maintenance and, often times,
professional services and other products and services. We allocate revenue to
delivered components, normally the license component, of the arrangement using
the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the
undelivered elements, which is specific to us. Fair values for the maintenance
service for our software licenses are based upon renewal rates stated in the
contracts or, in limited cases, separate sales of renewals to other customers.
Fair value for the professional services and other products and services is
based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers. We
recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term. Our
professional services, which include consulting, implementation management,
integration management, custom report writing and training, are generally billed
based on hourly rates. We recognize revenue as these professional services are
performed. Other products and services, which are subscription and transaction
based, include interfacing and downloading of securities information from third
party providers. Subscription-based revenues are recognized ratably over the
period of the contract. Transaction-based revenues are generally recognized when
the transactions occur. Revenues for development agreements are recognized using
the percentage-of-completion method of accounting based on costs incurred to
date compared with the estimated cost of completion. We analyze specific
accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer
credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment
terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We
also analyze customer demand and acceptance of our product and historical
returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns, which
are not generally provided to our customers.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL - We assess the
impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related goodwill
and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider
important which could trigger an impairment review include the following (1)
significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future
operating results; (2) significant changes in the manner of our use of the
acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; (3) significant
negative industry or economic trends; (4) significant decline in our stock price
for a sustained period; and (5) our market capitalization relative to net book
value. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived
assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable
based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment,
and based on the carrying value of the asset being less than the undiscounted
cash flows, we measure an impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow
method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate
with the risk inherent in our current business model. We hold minority interests
in private companies having operations or technology in areas within our
strategic focus. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an
investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary.
Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of
underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the
carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment's
current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the
future. We estimate an investment's current carrying value based primarily on
market conditions, recent valuation events and operating results of the
underlying investment. Recently issued accounting pronouncements, described
later under the "Overview" section, may effect the assessment of valuations of
long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill in future periods.

INCOME TAXES - Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes.
Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and
financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of this difference is
reported as deferred income taxes and results in a deferred tax asset.
Management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will
be realized in future years. Significant factors considered by management in its
determination of the probability of the realization include: 1) our historical
operating results, 2) expectations of future earnings and 3) the length of time
over which the differences will be paid.


   OVERVIEW

     ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

       On January 31, 2001, we acquired all outstanding equity of Rex
Development Partners, L.P., a limited partnership, for approximately $8.6
million in cash and acquisition costs. This business combination was accounted
for as a purchase and the results of operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. Rex Development
Partners, L.P. was formed to accelerate the development of technology
incorporated in our Rex service. This purchase provides us with core
technologies which will be used in Advent TrustedNetwork.

       The allocation of the purchase price for Rex Development Partners, L.P.
was based on the estimated fair value of the net assets of $100,000 at the
acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $1.0 million and current
liabilities of $900,000), and acquired technologies $8.5 million. The acquired
intangible is included in Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

       In April 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of NPO
Solutions, Inc. ("NPO"), a privately held provider of integrated computer
software solutions for nonprofit organizations based in Loudon, New Hampshire,
through our wholly-owned subsidiary MicroEdge, Inc. The total purchase price was
$8.1 million, with an additional $1.5 million potentially to be distributed to
NPO stockholders if NPO meets certain milestones. The purchase price consisted
of $6.8 million of cash as well as $1.3 million in net liabilities assumed and
acquisition related expenses. This business combination was accounted for as a
purchase and the results of operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.

       The allocation of the purchase price of NPO was based on the estimated
fair value of the net liabilities of approximately $1.3 million at the
acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $700,000; property, plant and
equipment of $160,000; and current liabilities of $2.2 million), goodwill of
$2.8 million, and other intangibles primarily consisting of customer base and
acquired technologies of $5.3 million. The goodwill and other intangibles are
included in Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount
allocated to intangibles was determined based on management's estimates using
established valuation techniques.

       In April 2001, we joined with Accenture, Microsoft, Inc., Compaq Computer
Corp., and the Bank of New York to create Encompys, an independent company that
is developing an internet-based straight-through-processing solution for the
global asset management community. We invested $8.8 million to help form this
new business venture, which is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable
value in Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

       In November 2001, we acquired certain assets of ManagerLink.com for a
total purchase price of $2.9 million, consisting of $1.5 million in cash as well
as $1.4 in net liabilities assumed and acquisition related expenses. This
transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations are
included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition
date. ManagerLink.com is located in Cleveland, Ohio and provides consolidated
portfolio reporting tools to CPA's, family offices, and other firms. We acquired
ManagerLink.com at amounts exceeding the tangible and identifiable intangible
fair values of assets and liabilities resulting in goodwill of $1.5 million in
order to further increase our deployment of Advent TrustedNetwork.

       The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for ManagerLink.com was
based on the estimated fair value of the net liabilities of $1.4 million at the
acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $22,000; property, plant and
equipment of $156,000; and current liabilities of $1.6 million), goodwill of
$1.5 million (deductible for tax purposes), and other intangibles consisting of
acquired technology and trade name of $1.4 million which have a weighted average
amortization period of 5 years. The goodwill and other intangibles are included
in Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount allocated to
intangibles was determined based on management's estimates using established
valuation techniques.

       In November 2001, we acquired all of the common stock of our Scandinavian
distributors' operations located in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark for a total
purchase price of approximately $15.4 million, of which $13.5 was paid in cash
as well as $1.9 million in assumed liabilities and acquisition related expenses.
In addition, we are required to pay 50% of operating margins that exceed 20% for
the two years after the acquisition. These transactions were accounted for as
purchases and the results of operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. We acquired our
Scandinavian distributors' operations at amounts exceeding the tangible and
identifiable intangible fair values of assets and liabilities resulting in
goodwill of $7.3 million in order to expand control over European channels for
our products and services.

       The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for our Scandinavian
distributor was based on the estimated fair value of the net liabilities of $1.9
million at the acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $2.2 million;
property, plant and equipment of $109,000; and current liabilities of $4.2
million), goodwill of $7.3 million (not deductible for tax purposes), and other
intangibles consisting of licensing agreements and acquired technology of $8.1
million which have a weighted average amortization period of 5 years. The
goodwill and other intangibles are included in Other assets, net on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount allocated to intangibles was determined
based on management's estimates using established valuation techniques.

     In February 2002, we acquired Kinexus Corporation of New York, New York.
Consideration included cash of approximately $37.8 million, a warrant to
purchase 165,176 shares of our Common Stock valued at $8.5 million, and assumed
net liabilities and acquisition costs. The warrant was calculated using the
Black-Scholes method to determine fair value, has an exercise price of $.01 per
share, is immediately exercisable, and expires on January 1, 2003. The warrant
was exercised in February 2002. There is a potential additional earn-out
distribution to shareholders of up to $115 million in cash and stock under a
formula based on revenue and expenses. Kinexus provides internal account
aggregation and manual data management services which we will use in our Advent
TrustedNetwork service.

DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIP

     We rely on a number of strategic alliances to help us achieve market
acceptance of our products and to leverage our development, sales, and marketing
resources. In 1998 we established one such relationship with a company in
Scandinavia to distribute our products within Scandinavia. In the third quarter
of 1999, this distributor formed Advent

                                       3
<PAGE>

Europe. Advent Europe and its subsidiaries have the exclusive right to
distribute our software in the European Union, excluding certain locations,
until July 1, 2004 subject to achieving certain revenue levels. Incorporated in
The Netherlands, Advent Europe is an independent entity which is not financially
backed by us and is entirely capitalized by independent third party investors.
It makes tax and language modifications to Advent Office to fit the various
needs of the local jurisdictions and then markets and licenses the Advent Office
suite and related services. All transactions between Advent Europe and us are
transacted in U.S. dollars and are arms length transactions. Revenue from sales
to this distributor is recognized when the distributor submits a signed
contract, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed and determinable, and
the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Our revenues from this
distributor in each of the three years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999
were less than 4% of our total net revenue.

     Through July 1, 2004, subject to achieving certain revenue levels, Advent
Europe also has the contingent right to require us to purchase any one or any
group of their subsidiaries. Our requirement to purchase is contingent upon the
distributor achieving specified operating margins in excess of 20% as well as
customer satisfaction criteria as specified in the agreement. The purchase price
would be two times the preceding twelve months total revenue of the purchased
subsidiaries plus an earn-out equal to 50% of operating margins that exceed 20%
for the two years after the acquisition. As of December 31, 2001, none of this
distributor's subsidiaries have met the criteria which could trigger this
contingent right. In addition, we have the right to purchase any one or any
group of the distributor's subsidiaries under certain conditions. In the event
these rights are exercised by us or the distributor, the purchase of these
subsidiaries would principally result in an increase in intangible assets,
goodwill and amortization of intangible assets. In November 2001, we acquired
three of Advent Europe's companies located in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. In
addition to the purchase price paid for these three companies, there is
potential additional consideration equal to 50% of operating margins greater
than 20% that are achieved in the two years subsequent to our acquisition of
these companies as described above.


SECONDARY OFFERINGS

     In June 1999, we completed a secondary public offering of 3.9 million
shares of our Common Stock at an offering price of $20.688 per share, excluding
offering costs. Of the 3.9 million shares of Common Stock offered, 300,000
shares were sold by a selling stockholder. The net proceeds of the offering to
us were $70.2 million.

     In August 2001, we completed a secondary public offering of 2,750,000
shares of our Common Stock at $57.11 per share, excluding offering costs. Of the
2,750,000 shares offered, 200,000 were sold by a selling stockholder. The net
proceeds of the offering to us were approximately $138 million.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE

     In September and October 2001 we repurchased and retired 430,000 shares of
our own Common Stock under a program approved by our Board of Directors in March
2001 to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares from time to time. We paid $14.8
million for an average of $34.44 per share.

STOCK SPLITS

     Our Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our Common Stock
in July 1999. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend to stockholders
of record as of the close of business on July 30, 1999. This stock split
increased the number of common shares outstanding from approximately 9.6 million
shares to approximately 14.4 million shares.

      Our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our Common Stock in
February 2000. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend to stockholders
of record as of the close of business on February 28, 2000. This stock split
increased the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding from approximately
14.8 million shares to approximately 29.6 million shares.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000, AND 1999

REVENUES

                                       4
<PAGE>

     Net revenues were $170.2 million, $134.9 million and $101.6 million in
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, representing increases of 26% from 2000 to
2001 and 33% from 1999 to 2000. Our net revenues are derived from license and
development fees, maintenance and other recurring revenues, and professional
services and other revenues related to our software products. In each of 2001,
2000, and 1999, the majority of our net revenues were from domestic sales, with
international sales representing less than 8% in each year. License revenues are
derived from the licensing of software products while development fees are
derived from development contracts that we have entered into with other
companies, including customers and development partners. Maintenance and other
recurring revenues are derived from maintenance fees charged in the initial
licensing year, renewals of annual maintenance services in subsequent years and
recurring revenues derived from our subscription-based and transaction-based
services. Professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting,
implementation and integration management, custom report writing, training
services and semi-annual conferences.

     Axys and its related products and services accounted for the majority of
net revenues in 2001, 2000, and 1999. However, we have been successful in
increasing multi-product sales by emphasizing our suite of products and,
therefore, new products have accounted for an increasing portion of net revenues
in all three years.

     Each of the major revenue categories has historically varied as a
percentage of net revenues and we expect this variability to continue in future
periods. This variability is partially due to the timing of the introduction of
new products, the relative size and timing of individual licenses, as well as
the size of the implementation, the resulting proportion of the maintenance and
professional services components of these license transactions and the amount of
client use of pricing and related data.

     LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT FEES. License and development fees revenue were
$83.6 million, $66.1 million and $49.3 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively, representing increases of 27% from 2000 to 2001 and 34% from 1999
to 2000. License and development fees revenues as a percentage of net revenues
were 49% in 2001, 2000, and 1999. The increases in license revenue, in absolute
dollars, were primarily due to increased demand for the Advent Office suite to
both new customers as well as follow-on sales to existing customers, and for our
Geneva software which is sold primarily to global financial institutions and
hedge funds. We typically license our products on a per server, per user basis
with the price per site varying based on the selection of the products licensed
and the number of authorized users. We earn development fees when we provide
product solutions which are not part of our standard product offering. For the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 revenue from development fees has
been less than 10% of total license and development fees revenue.

     MAINTENANCE AND OTHER RECURRING. Maintenance and other recurring revenues
were $67.7 million, $50.1 million and $38.2 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively, representing increases of 35% from 2000 to 2001 and 31% from 1999
to 2000. Maintenance and other recurring revenues, as a percentage of net
revenues, were 40%, 37% and 38% in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The
growth in maintenance and other recurring revenues, in absolute dollars, in all
periods was primarily due to a larger customer base and higher average
maintenance fees. Higher average maintenance fees are primarily due to clients
selecting more components for a full feature, multi-product solution and clients
expanding the number of users and sites licensing our software. In addition,
increased revenue from our Advent Custodial Data service as well as our other
data feed revenue sources contributed to the rise in maintenance and other
recurring revenues from 2000 to 2001 both in absolute dollars and as a
percentage of total revenue.

     PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND OTHER. Professional services and other revenues
were $18.9 million, $18.7 million and $14.1 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively, representing increases of 1% from 2000 to 2001 and 33% from 1999
to 2000. Professional services and other revenues, as a percentage of net
revenues, was 11% in 2001 and 14% in both 2000 and 1999. The increase in
professional services and other revenue from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to
higher consulting fees from increasingly larger implementations at larger
financial institutions as well as higher custom report writing revenue generated
from a larger customer base. The relatively flat revenue between 2001 and 2000
reflects our continued encouragement of independent qualified third party
implementers to provide services to our clients.

COST OF REVENUES

     COST OF LICENSE AND DEVELOPMENT FEES. Cost of license and development fees
revenues were $6.5 million, $5.3 million and $3.6 million in 2001, 2000, and
1999, respectively, representing 8%, 8% and 7% of license and development fees
revenues in these periods, respectively. Cost of license and development fees
revenue consists

                                       5
<PAGE>

primarily of the cost of product media and duplication, manuals, packaging
materials, the direct labor involved in producing and distributing our software;
labor costs associated with generating development fees; and royalties paid to
third parties. Cost of license and development fees will fluctuate between
periods due to the mix of license and development fee revenues. The increase in
costs, in absolute dollars, in all years is primarily related to increased
associated revenues.

     COST OF MAINTENANCE AND OTHER RECURRING. Cost of maintenance and other
recurring revenues were $17.0 million, $13.5 million and $10.4 million in 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively, representing 25%, 27% and 27% of maintenance and
other recurring revenues in these periods, respectively. These costs are
primarily comprised of the direct costs of providing technical support and other
services for recurring revenues, the engineering costs associated with product
updates and royalties paid to third party subscription-based and
transaction-based vendors. These expenses, in absolute dollars, increased in
each year due to increased staffing required to support a larger customer base
and larger implementations as well as increased royalties paid to third party
subscription-based and transaction-based vendors. Cost of maintenance and other
recurring revenues as a percentage of related revenues was stable between 1999
and 2000 and decreased from 2000 to 2001 primarily due to the change in the
revenue mix.

     COST OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND OTHER. Cost of professional services and
other revenues were $6.2 million, $6.1 million and $5.3 million in 2001, 2000,
and 1999, respectively, representing 33%, 33% and 38% of professional services
and other revenues in these periods, respectively. These costs consist primarily
of personnel related costs associated with the client services and support
organization in providing consulting, custom report writing, conversions of data
from clients' previous systems, and cost of hosting our client conferences. To
the extent that such personnel are not fully used in consulting, training,
conversion or custom report writing projects, they are used by presales,
marketing and engineering activities and the resultant costs are charged to
operating expenses. Cost of professional services and other, in absolute
dollars, increased year to year due to increases in personnel and related costs
necessary to provide services to an expanded installed base. Cost of
professional services as a percentage of related revenues decreased between 1999
and 2000 primarily due to higher utilization of personnel and economies of scale
associated with absorbing fixed costs over a larger revenue base. Cost of
professional services as a percentage of related revenues remained constant
between 2000 and 2001.


OPERATING EXPENSES

     SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses were $52.2 million, $42.6
million and $32.2 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, representing
increases of 23% from 2000 to 2001 and 32% from 1999 to 2000. Sales and
marketing expenses, as a percentage of net revenues, were 31% in 2001 and 32% in
both 2000 and 1999. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the costs
of personnel involved in the sales and marketing process, sales commissions,
advertising and promotional materials, sales facilities expense, trade shows,
and seminars. The increases in absolute dollars, for 2001, 2000, and 1999 were
due to a continued increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel and
increased marketing efforts towards the Advent Office suite and our internet
based product offerings. In 2000, sales and marketing expenses also increased
due to moving our New York City sales office to a larger facility in April 2000.

     PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. Research and development expenses consist primarily of
salary and benefits for our development staff as well as contractors fees and
other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and services
and development of new products and services. Costs associated with product
updates are included in cost of maintenance and other recurring revenue. Product
development expenses were $27.4 million, $21.6 million and $16.8 million in
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, representing increases of 27% from 2000 to
2001 and 29% from 1999 to 2000. Product development expenses, as a percentage of
net revenues, were 16% in both 2001 and 2000 and 17% in 1999. Product
development expenses increased, in absolute dollars, in all three years
primarily due to an increase in the number of personnel as we increased our
product development efforts to accelerate the rate of product enhancements and
new product introductions in our Advent Office Suite and Geneva product.
Additionally, we have increased our expenditures in each of the three years to
develop and launch Advent TrustedNetwork and our continued development of
related wealth management solutions, both released and unreleased. We anticipate
that product development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars,
although such expenses may vary as a percentage of net revenues.

     GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses were $14.8
million, $12.0 million and $9.9 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively,
representing increases of 24% from 2000 to 2001 and 21% from 1999 to

                                       6
<PAGE>

2000. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net revenues, were
9% in 2001 and 2000 and 10% in 1999. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of personnel costs for finance, administration, operations and general
management, as well as legal and accounting expenses. The increases, in absolute
dollars, were primarily due to an increase in the number of personnel and
related costs to support our growth.

    AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES. We recorded amortization of goodwill and other
intangibles of approximately $4.7 million in 2001 and $1.5 million in 2000 and
1999. This amortization is based on the goodwill and other intangibles we
recorded in connection with our acquisitions. We typically record goodwill and
other intangibles based on independent appraisals of our acquisitions using our
estimates of market potential, product introductions, technology trends, and any
other relevant cash flow assumptions. The revenues and costs associated with the
goodwill and other intangibles have been materially consistent with these
assumptions. We periodically assess our estimates related to the valuation model
to determine if the assets acquired have been impaired. If we determine that
there has been impairment, there could be additional charges to income. In
accordance with FAS 142 issued in July 2001, we did not record any amortization
of goodwill on our acquisitions of ManagerLink.com or our Scandinavian
distributors, and we will no longer amortize goodwill from any of our
acquisitions beginning January 1, 2002.


INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

     Interest and other income, net was approximately $6.3 million, $6.8 million
and $4.6 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Interest and other
income, net consists primarily of interest income, as well as interest expense,
realized gains and losses on investments that are other-than-temporary, and
miscellaneous non-operating income and expense items. The decrease from 2000 to
2001 was substantially due to lower interest rates, realized gains and losses
and other-than-temporary losses on investments of approximately $2.0 million,
partially offset by higher investment balances resulting from our August 2001
secondary offering. The increase from 1999 to 2000 was due to higher interest
income as a result of higher investment balances resulting from our June 1999
secondary offering partially offset by other-than-temporary losses of
approximately $500,000.

INCOME TAXES

     We had an effective income tax rate of 34% in 2001, 2000, and 1999. This
rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income tax,
offset by certain research and development credits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2001 were $166.8 million,
increasing by $69.8 million from $97.0 million at December 31, 2000. This
increase was due to $146.6 million provided by financing activities and $43.0
million provided by operating activities offset by $119.7 million used in
investing activities.

    The net cash provided from operating activities of $43.0 million for 2001
was primarily due to net income, increases in deferred revenues, the tax benefit
associated with common stock issued under employee benefit plans, and
depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges. These were partially
offset by increases in accounts receivable as well as prepaid and other assets.
Financing activities provided $146.6 million for 2001 primarily due to proceeds
from our August 2001 common stock offering as well as proceeds from the issuance
of common stock under our employee stock benefit plans. This was offset by cash
used to repurchase and retire our common stock under a stock repurchase program
that had been announced earlier in the year. Net cash used in investing
activities of $119.7 million for 2001 primarily related to net expenditures of
$44.1 million to acquire or make investments in complementary businesses and
technologies, net short-term investment purchases of $66.5 million, and
expenditures of $9.1 million for furniture, fixtures and equipment and leasehold
improvements primarily for our additional new leased office space at our
corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California.

  The net cash provided from operating activities of $35.3 million for 2000 was
primarily due to net income and an increase in deferred revenues, the tax
benefit associated with common stock issued under employee benefit plans, and
depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges. These were partially
offset by increases in accounts receivable as well as prepaid and other assets.
Financing activities provided $12.6 million in 2000 primarily due to proceeds
from our employees exercising rights under our stock option and employee stock
purchase plans. Net cash used in investing activities of $15.1 million for 2000
primarily related to expenditures of $10.4 million for furniture,

                                       7
<PAGE>

fixtures and equipment and leasehold improvements primarily for our additional
new leased office space at our corporate headquarters in San Francisco,
California as well as new, larger leased space for our offices in New York, New
York.

  The net cash provided from operating activities of $10.3 million for 1999 was
primarily due to net income and an increase in deferred revenues, the tax
benefit associated with common stock issued under employee benefit plans, and
depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges. These were offset by
increases in accounts receivable as well as prepaid and other assets as a result
of us making prepayments to certain vendors in order to receive favorable
pricing. Financing activities provided $77.0 million for 1999 primarily due to
proceeds from our June 1999 common stock offering as well as proceeds from the
issuance of common stock under our employee stock benefit plans. Net cash used
in investing activities of $58.6 million for 1999 is primarily due to the net
purchases of short term securities of $47.1 million and expenditures of $8.3
million for furniture, fixtures and equipment and leasehold improvements
primarily for our expansion of our office space at our corporate headquarters in
San Francisco, California.

    At December 31, 2001, we had $311 million in working capital, up from $161
million at December 31, 2000. Our current significant capital commitments
consist of commitments under operating leases of $54.2 million as well as our
agreement and plan to acquire Kinexus Corporation which requires cash
consideration of $37.8 million to be paid at the closing of the acquisition. The
$37.8 million consideration was paid on February 14, 2002.

   At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we did not have any relationships with
unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often
referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have
been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements
or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not
materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could
arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

   Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flows, which is
dependent upon continued market acceptance of our products and services. We
believe that our available sources of funds and anticipated cash flows from
operations will be adequate to finance current operations and anticipated
capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.


NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

    In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB or the "Board")
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141), BUSINESS
COMBINATIONS, and No. 142 (SFAS 142), GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,
collectively referred to as the "Standards". SFAS 141 supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 16, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. The provisions of
SFAS 141 (1) require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, (2) provide specific
criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart
from goodwill, and (3) require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off
immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized.
SFAS 141 also requires that upon adoption of SFAS 142 we reclassify the carrying
amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill, based on certain
criteria. SFAS 142 supersedes APB 17, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 142 primarily addresses the
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial
recognition. The provisions of SFAS 142 (1) prohibit the amortization of
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, (2) require that goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles assets be tested annually for impairment (and in
interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of
goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired), (3) require
that reporting units be identified for the purpose of

                                       8
<PAGE>

assessing potential future impairments of goodwill, and (4) remove the
forty-year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have
finite lives.

    We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 142 in our first quarter ended March
31, 2002. We are in the process of preparing for our adoption of SFAS 142 and
are making the determinations as to what our reporting units are and what
amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, other assets, and liabilities should be
allocated to those reporting units. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142,
we are required to reclassify goodwill balances to various intangible asset
classifications if deemed necessary under the guidance, which is not expected to
be significant. We expect that we will no longer record $1.2 million of
amortization relating to our existing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.
We will also be required to evaluate the useful lives assigned to our intangible
assets.

    SFAS 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a
two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and, in
transition, this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year.
However, a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the
first step. We expect to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment
test during the second quarter of 2002. The second step of the goodwill
impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss (measured as of the
beginning of the year of adoption), if any, and must be completed by the end of
our fiscal year. Intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be
tested for impairment using a one-step process which compares the fair value to
the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year, and
pursuant to the requirements of SFAS 142 will be completed during the first
quarter of 2002. Any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment
tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in the first quarter 2002. We have not yet determined what effect
these impairment tests will have on our financial position or results of
operations.

     In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets", which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This Statement supersedes FASB
Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of", and the accounting and reporting
provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions", for the disposal of
a segment of a business. This Statement also amends Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements", to eliminate the exception to
consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary. The
provisions of SFAS 144 are required to be adopted during our fiscal year
beginning January 1, 2002, however early adoption is acceptable. We are
currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact the adoption of SFAS
144 will have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In November 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on EITF Issue 01-09,
"Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a customer or a Reseller of a
Vendor's Products" which is a codification of EITF 00-14, 00-22, and 00-25. This
issue presumes consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of a
vendor's products to be reduction of the selling prices of a vendor's products
and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction in revenue when
recognized in the vendor's income statement and could lead to negative revenue
under certain circumstances. Revenue reduction is required unless consideration
relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit's fair value can be
established. This issue should be applied no later than in annual or interim
financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 2001, which is our
first quarter ended March 31, 2002. Upon adoption we are required to reclassify
all prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. We have
evaluated the effect on our financial statements and believe that the adoption
will not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

     In November 2001, the FASB EITF reached a consensus to issue a FASB Staff
Announcement Topic No. D-103, "Income Statement Characterization of
Reimbursements Received for "Out-of-Pocket" Expenses Incurred" which clarifies
that that reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses incurred should be
characterized as revenue in the income statement. This staff announcement should
be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2001.
Upon application of this staff announcement, comparative financial statements
for prior periods should be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this
staff announcement. We have evaluated the effect on our financial statements and
believe that adoption will not have a significant effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

RISK FACTORS AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

                                       9
<PAGE>

     The discussion in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this Annual Report
contains trend analysis and other forward-looking statements that are based on
current expectations and assumptions made by management. Words such as
"expects", "anticipates", "intends", "plans", "believes", "seeks", "estimates",
and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify
such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to
predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from those expressed
or forecasted in the forward-looking statements as a result of the factors
summarized below and other risks detailed from time to time in public
announcements, registration statements and filings with the SEC, including
reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Additionally, the financial statements for the
periods presented are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for
any future period.

     We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of
risks, some of which are beyond our control. These risks include the potential
for period to period fluctuations in operating results and the dependence on
continued market acceptance of our current product offerings and the successful
development and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements on a
timely, cost effective basis. Additionally, we derive a majority of our revenue
from the licensing of our Advent Office suite. We cannot be certain that Advent
Office will continue to be well received by our customers. Also, we are
dependent on the stability of financial markets, the maintenance of our
relationship with Interactive Data, and our ability remain competitive against
new and existing rivals in our market. In particular, our net revenues and
operating results have varied substantially from period to period on a quarterly
basis and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors. We typically
ship our software products shortly after receipt of a signed license agreement.
License backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents only a
small portion of that quarter's expected revenues. In addition, as licenses into
multi-user networked environments increase both in individual size and number,
the timing and size of individual license transactions are becoming increasingly
important factors in our quarterly operating results. The sales cycles for these
transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable, and the ability to close large
license transactions on a timely basis or at all could cause additional
variability in our quarterly operating results. We also expect that our gross
and operating margins may fluctuate from period to period as we continue to
introduce new recurring revenue products, expand our professional services
organization and associated revenue, continue to hire additional personnel and
increase other expenses to support our business. We plan our expense levels
based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. Because these expenses are
relatively fixed in the short term, a fluctuation in revenue could lead to
operating results differing from expectations.

     In addition, a number of factors including market volatility, global
economic uncertainty and reductions in capital expenditures by large customers
could adversely impact our results. The target clients for our products include
a range of organizations that manage investment portfolios, including investment
advisors, brokerage firms, banks and hedge funds. In addition, we target
corporations, public funds, universities and non-profit organizations, which
also manage investment portfolios and have many of the same needs. The success
of many of our clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial
markets. We believe that demand for our products could be disproportionately
affected by fluctuations, disruptions, instability or downturns in the financial
markets which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or
delay, cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management
systems and software products.

     In particular, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 impeded our
ability to sell and deliver products and services. Further attacks could have an
immediate and direct negative impact on our business and our profitability. The
terrorist attacks also caused uncertainty in the financials markets upon which
we and our clients depend. Increased uncertainty in the financial markets as a
result of further terrorist strikes could seriously damage our business.

     The market for investment management software is intensely competitive and
highly fragmented, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product
introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants. Our competitors
include providers of software and related services as well as providers of
timeshare services. Our competitors vary in size, scope of services offered and
platforms supported. In addition, we compete indirectly with existing and
potential clients, many of whom develop their own software for their particular
needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by
independent vendors like us. Many of our competitors have longer operating
histories and greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than
we do. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against
current and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in
price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of
which could seriously harm our business.

                                       10
<PAGE>

Our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop our
products, such as the Advent Office suite, Geneva and Advent TrustedNetwork that
continue to address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to
emerging industry standards and practices. To take advantage of the internet, we
are developing services to bring internet-based products and services to
clients. We cannot assure you that there will not be disruptions in internet
services which could harm our business. The internet is a public network, and
data is sent over this network from many sources. We may be required to expend
significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of
security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. To the extent
that our activities may involve the storage and transmission of proprietary
information, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation
and possible liability. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent
security breaches, and our business would be harmed if we do not prevent them.

    We are directing a significant amount of our product development efforts
towards developing internet-based products and services. The failure to achieve
widespread market acceptance of our internet-based products and services on a
timely basis would adversely affect our business and operating results. The
success of these developments efforts, in particular, is difficult to predict
because it represents a new area of business for our entire industry. As we
continue to develop new products and services, we have and will continue to
enter into development agreements with information providers, clients, or other
companies in order to accelerate the delivery of new products and services.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing our existing
products, new product or modifications of our products. Our failure to do so
could adversely affect our business and operating results.

     Our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first
introduced or as new versions are released. Despite testing by us and by current
and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products until after
commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or a delay in market
acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

     Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology. Despite
our efforts to protect our proprietary technology, it may be possible for
unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. We do
not have any patents, and existing copyright laws afford only limited
protection. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not develop
substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or that
equivalent products will not be marketed in competition with our products,
thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. We cannot
assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are
patentable, that any patent, if issued, would provide us with any competitive
advantages or would not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of
others will not adversely affect our ability to do business. Litigation may be
necessary to protect our proprietary technology. This litigation may be
time-consuming and expensive.

     We have expanded in recent periods into a number of new business areas to
foster long-term growth including international operations. We currently have
limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and
marketing and distributing our products internationally. In addition,
international operations are subject to other inherent risks, including: the
impact of recessions in economies outside the United States; greater difficulty
in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods; unexpected
changes in regulatory requirements; difficulties in successfully adapting our
products to the language, regulatory and technology standards of other
countries; difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
potentially adverse tax consequences; and political and economic instability.

     We may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or
technologies. In addition, we continually evaluate the performance of all our
products and product lines and may sell or discontinue current products or
product lines. If we buy a company, we could have difficulty in integrating that
company's personnel and operations. In addition, the key personnel of the
acquired company may decide not to work for us. If we make other types of
acquisitions, we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired technology
or products into our operations. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing
business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses.
Furthermore, we may have to incur debt, write-off software development costs or
other assets, incur severance liabilities, amortize expenses related to goodwill
and other intangible assets or issue equity securities to pay for any future
acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing
stockholders' ownership.

     Our continued success depends, in part, on the services of several of our
key executive, technical and sales employees. The loss of services of these
personnel, or our inability to identify, attract, motivate and retain other
qualified management, technical, and sales employees, could have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Because our

                                       11
<PAGE>

future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce
new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract,
motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education,
backgrounds and industry experience.

     Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power
loss, telecommunications failure, political disturbances and other events beyond
our control.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


     1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OPERATIONS We provide stand-alone and client/server software products, data
interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate, integrate and
support certain mission-critical functions of the front, middle and back offices
of investment management organizations. Our clients vary significantly in size
and assets under management and include investment advisors, brokerage firms,
banks, hedge funds, corporations, public funds, foundations, universities and
non-profit organizations.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Advent and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions and amounts have been eliminated.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries
is their local currencies. All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance
sheet date. Revenues, costs and expenses are translated at average rate of
exchange during the period.

USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. These estimates are based on information available as of the
date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The amounts reported for cash equivalents,
marketable securities, receivables, and accounts payable are considered to
approximate their market values based on comparable market information available
at the respective balance sheet dates and their short-term nature.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less. These
securities are maintained with major financial institutions.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES All of our marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value,
with the unrealized gains and losses, net of any related tax effect, reported in
accumulated components of comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Realized gains and losses
and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale
securities are included in interest and other income, net, in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

INVESTMENTS Investments, included in other assets, consist of nonmarketable
investments in private companies, which are carried at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. Our investments in privately held companies are considered
impaired when a review of the investee's operations and other indicators of
impairment indicate that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to
be recoverable. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, limited capital
resources, limited prospects of receiving additional financing, and prospects
for liquidity of the related securities. Impaired investments in privately held
companies are written down to estimated fair value, which is the amount we
believe is recoverable from our investment.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT Research and development expenses consist primarily of
salary, benefits, and contractors fees for our development and technical support
staff, and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and
services and development of new products and services. Costs incurred for
software development prior to technological feasibility are expensed as product
development costs in the period incurred. Once the point of technological
feasibility is reached, development costs are capitalized until the product is
available for general release. Capitalized costs are then amortized
straight-line over the estimated useful life or on the ratio of current revenue
to the total projected product revenue, whichever is greater. To date, the
period between achieving technology feasibility, which we define as the
establishment of a working model and typically occurs when beta testing
commences, and the general availability of such software has been short. As
such, software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been
insignificant and therefore no costs have been capitalized to date.

                                       16

CAPITALIZATION OF INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE Costs incurred for web site design,
creation and maintenance of content, graphics and user interface are expensed as
incurred. Costs for development of internal use software are capitalized and
amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to four years.
Costs of approximately $836,000 and $877,000 related to development of internal
use software were capitalized in 2001 and 2000, respectively. No costs were
capitalized in 1999.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. We calculate depreciation and
amortization using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful
lives. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is computed using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets
or the remaining lease term. The cost and related accumulated depreciation
applicable to property and equipment sold or no longer in service are eliminated
from the accounts and any gains or losses are included in operations. Useful
lives by principal classifications are as follows:

                  Office equipment                 5 years
                  Computers and software           5 years
                  Leasehold improvements           3 - 11 years

Repairs and maintenance expenditures, which are not considered improvements and
do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed as
incurred.

ACCOUNTING FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are stated at cost less
amortization and include goodwill, completed technology and non-compete and
distribution agreements. Goodwill is the excess of cost over fair value of the
net assets acquired. Goodwill from acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001 has
not been amortized. Prior to July 1, 2001, goodwill and other intangibles were
amortized through December 31, 2001 on a straight line basis over the estimated
periods of benefit, as follows:

                  Goodwill                         4 to 7 years
                  Completed technology             3 to 5 years
                  Agreements                       5  years
                  Customer base and tradename      5 to 7 years


ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS We review property, equipment and other
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability is measured by comparison of the assets' carrying amount to their
expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its expected future discounted cash flow.

REVENUE RECOGNITION We license application software products and offer annual
maintenance programs which provide for technical support and updates to our
software products. We offer professional services that primarily include
consulting, implementation management, integration management, custom report
writing and training. We offer other recurring revenue products and services
that are subscription-based and transaction-based that primarily include
interfacing and downloading of securities information from third party
providers. Development agreements provide for the development of technologies
and products that are expected to become part of our product or product
offerings in the future.

We recognize revenue from software licenses when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists which is evidenced by a signed agreement, the product has
been delivered F.O.B shipping point, the fee is fixed and determinable and
collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Sales through our
distributor are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship
together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor's
customers. Our arrangements do not generally include acceptance provisions yet
if acceptance provisions are provided delivery occurs upon acceptance. Our
arrangements for sale of software licenses are sold with maintenance and, often
times, professional services and other products and services. We allocate
revenue to delivered components, normally the license component, of the
arrangement using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the
fair value of the undelivered elements, which is specific to us. Fair values for
the maintenance service for our software licenses are generally based upon
renewal rates stated in the contracts. Fair value for the professional services
and other products and services is based upon separate sales by us of these
services to other customers. We recognize revenue for

                                       17
<PAGE>

maintenance services ratably over the contract term. Our professional services
are generally billed based on hourly rates, and we recognize revenue as these
services are performed. Subscription-based revenues are recognized ratably over
the period of the contract. Transaction-based revenues are generally recognized
when the transactions occur. Revenues for development agreements are recognized
using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting based on costs incurred
to date compared with the estimated cost of completion. We analyze specific
accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer
credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment
terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We
also analyze customer demand and acceptance of our product and historical
returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns, which
are not generally provided to our customers.

ADVERTISING COSTS We expense advertising costs as incurred. Total advertising
expenses were approximately $73,000, $77,000 and $173,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We use the intrinsic value-based method to account for
all of our stock-based employee compensation plans. We are required to disclose
the pro forma effects on operating results as if we had elected to use the fair
value approach to account for all our stock-based employee compensation plans
(See Note 9). Stock-based compensation for non-employees is based on the fair
value of the related stock or options.

INCOME TAXES We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized principally for the expected
tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements
or tax returns for temporary differences between the tax basis of the assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts. A valuation allowance is then
established to reduce the net deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not
that the related tax benefit will not be realized.

NET INCOME PER SHARE Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for that
period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive
potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive
potential shares consist of incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of
stock options and warrants and conversion of preferred stock (none outstanding)
for all periods. All share and per-share data presented reflect the
three-for-two stock split effective July 1999 and the two-for-one stock split
effective February 2000 (See Note 8).

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME(LOSS) Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income,
net unrealized foreign currency translation adjustment and net unrealized gains
or losses on available-for-sale marketable securities and is presented in the
consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss).
Our total comprehensive income includes a reclassification adjustment for net
realized gains included in net income of $175,000 and a tax benefit related to
the components of other comprehensive income of $63,000.

SEGMENT INFORMATION We have determined that we have a single reportable segment
consisting of the development, marketing and sale of stand-alone and
client/server software products, data interfaces and related maintenance and
services that automate, integrate and support certain mission critical functions
of investment management organizations. Management uses one measurement of
profitability and does not disaggregate its business for internal reporting. No
country or region outside the United States accounted for more than 10% of our
total revenue for years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999. No one customer
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for years ended December 31,
2001, 2000, and 1999.

CERTAIN RISKS AND CONCENTRATIONS Our product revenues are concentrated in the
computer software industry, which is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
Significant technological changes in the industry or customer requirements, or
the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities or technologies
could adversely affect operating results. Additional, we derive a majority of
our revenues from licensing our application Axys and its related suite of
applications, and therefore its market acceptance is essential to our success.

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit
risks comprise, principally, cash, short-term marketable securities, and trade
accounts receivable. We invest excess cash through banks, mutual funds, and
brokerage houses primarily in highly liquid securities and have investment
policies and procedures that are reviewed periodically to minimize credit risk.
Our short-term marketable securities consist of diversified investment grade
securities. We believe no significant concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to these securities.

                                       18
<PAGE>

With respect to accounts receivable, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of
our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for
potential credit losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary. At December
31, 2001 and 2000, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts
receivable or 10% of revenues for the years then ended.

RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to the
current year presentation.

    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB or the "Board") issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141), BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, and No. 142 (SFAS 142),
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, collectively referred to as the
"Standards". SFAS 141 supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No.
16, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. The provisions of SFAS 141 (1) require that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001, (2) provide specific criteria for the initial recognition
and measurement of intangible assets apart from goodwill, and (3) require that
unamortized negative goodwill be written off immediately as an extraordinary
gain instead of being deferred and amortized. SFAS 141 also requires that upon
adoption of SFAS 142 we reclassify the carrying amounts of certain intangible
assets into or out of goodwill, based on certain criteria. SFAS 142 supersedes
APB 17, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. SFAS 142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and
intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition. The provisions of
SFAS 142 (1) prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets, (2) require that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles
assets be tested annually for impairment (and in interim periods if certain
events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and/or
indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired), (3) require that reporting
units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of
goodwill, and (4) remove the forty-year limitation on the amortization period of
intangible assets that have finite lives.

    We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 142 in our first quarter ended March
31, 2002. We are in the process of preparing for our adoption of SFAS 142 and
are making the determinations as to what our reporting units are and what
amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, other assets, and liabilities should be
allocated to those reporting units. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142,
we are required to reclassify goodwill balances to various intangible asset
classifications if deemed necessary under the guidance, which is not expected to
be significant. We expect that we will no longer record $1.2 million of
amortization relating to our existing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.
We will also be required to evaluate the useful lives assigned to our intangible
assets.

    SFAS 142 requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a
two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and, in
transition, this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year.
However, a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete the
first step. We expect to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment
test during the second quarter of 2002. The second step of the goodwill
impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss (measured as of the
beginning of the year of adoption), if any, and must be completed by the end of
our fiscal year. Intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be
tested for impairment using a one-step process which compares the fair value to
the carrying amount of the asset as of the beginning of the fiscal year, and
pursuant to the requirements of SFAS 142 will be completed during the first
quarter of 2002. Any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment
tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in the first quarter 2002. We have not yet determined what effect
these impairment tests will have on our financial position or results of
operations.

     In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144 ("SFAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets", which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This Statement supersedes FASB
Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of", and the accounting and reporting
provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary,
Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions", for the disposal of
a segment of a business. This Statement also amends Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements", to eliminate the exception to
consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary. The
provisions of SFAS 144 are required to be adopted during our fiscal year
beginning January 1, 2002, however early adoption is acceptable. We are
currently in the process of evaluating the potential impact the adoption of SFAS
144 will have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

     In November 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on EITF Issue 01-09,
"Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a customer or a Reseller of a
Vendor's Products" which is a codification of EITF 00-14, 00-22, and 00-25. This
issue presumes consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of a
vendor's products to be reduction of the selling prices of a vendor's products
and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction in revenue when
recognized in the vendor's income statement and could lead to negative revenue
under certain circumstances. Revenue reduction is required unless consideration
relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit's fair value can be
established. This issue should be applied no later than in annual or interim
financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 2001, which is our
first quarter ended March 31, 2002. Upon adoption we are required to reclassify
all prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. We have
evaluated the effect on our financial statements and believe that the adoption
will not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of
operations.

     In November 2001, the FASB EITF reached a consensus to issue a FASB Staff
Announcement Topic No. D-103, "Income Statement Characterization of
Reimbursements Received for "Out-of-Pocket" Expenses Incurred" which clarifies
that that reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses incurred should be
characterized as revenue in the income statement. This staff announcement should
be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2001.
Upon application of this staff announcement, comparative financial statements
for prior periods should be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this
staff announcement. We have evaluated the effect on our financial statements and
believe that adoption will not have a significant effect on our financial
position or results of operations.

     3. ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

       On January 31, 2001, we acquired all outstanding equity of Rex
Development Partners, L.P., a limited partnership, for approximately $8.6
million in cash and acquisition costs. This business combination was accounted
for as a purchase and the results of operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. Rex Development
Partners, L.P. was formed to accelerate the development of technology
incorporated in our Rex service. This purchase provides us with core
technologies which will be used in Advent TrustedNetwork.

       The allocation of the purchase price for Rex Development Partners, L.P.
was based on the estimated fair value of the net assets of $100,000 at the
acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $1.0 million and current
liabilities of $900,000), and acquired technologies of $8.5 million. The
acquired intangible is included in Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

       In April 2001, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of NPO
Solutions, Inc. ("NPO"), a privately held provider of integrated computer
software solutions for nonprofit organizations based in Loudon, New Hampshire,
through our wholly-owned subsidiary MicroEdge, Inc. The total purchase price was
$8.1 million, with an additional $1.5 million potentially to be distributed to
NPO stockholders if NPO meets certain milestones. The purchase price consisted
of $6.8 million of cash as well as $1.3 million in net liabilities assumed and
acquisition related expenses. This business combination was accounted for as a
purchase and the results of operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.

       The allocation of the purchase price of NPO was based on the estimated
fair value of the net liabilities of approximately $1.3 million at the
acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $700,000; property, plant and
equipment of $160,000; and current liabilities of $2.2 million), goodwill of
$2.8 million, and other intangibles primarily consisting of customer base and
acquired technologies of $5.3 million. The goodwill and other intangibles are
included in Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount
allocated to intangibles was determined based on management's estimates using
established valuation techniques.

       In April 2001, we joined with Accenture, Microsoft, Inc., Compaq Computer
Corp., and the Bank of New York to create Encompys, an independent company that
is developing an internet-based straight-through-processing solution for the
global asset management community. We invested $8.8 million to help form this
new business venture, which is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable
value in Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

       In November 2001, we acquired certain assets of ManagerLink.com for a
total purchase price of $2.9 million, consisting of $1.5 million in cash as well
as $1.4 in net liabilities assumed and acquisition related expenses. This
transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the results of operations are
included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition
date. ManagerLink.com is located in Cleveland, Ohio and provides consolidated
portfolio reporting tools to CPA's, family offices, and other firms. We acquired
ManagerLink.com at amounts exceeding the tangible and identifiable intangible
fair values of assets and liabilities resulting in goodwill of $1.5 million in
order to further increase our deployment of Advent TrustedNetwork.

       The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for ManagerLink.com was
based on the estimated fair value of the net liabilities of $1.4 million at the
acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $22,000; property, plant and
equipment of $156,000; and current liabilities of $1.6 million), goodwill of
$1.5 million (deductible for tax purposes), and other intangibles consisting of
acquired technology and trade name of $1.4 million which have a weighted average
amortization period of 5 years. The goodwill and other intangibles are included
in Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount allocated to
intangibles was determined based on management's estimates using established
valuation techniques.

       In November 2001, we acquired all of the common stock of our Scandinavian
distributors' operations located in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark for a total
purchase price of approximately $15.4 million, of which $13.5 was paid in cash
as well as $1.9 million in assumed liabilities and acquisition related expenses.
In addition, we are required to pay 50% of operating margins that exceed 20% for
the two years after the acquisition. These transactions were accounted for as
purchases and the results of operations are included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. We acquired our
Scandinavian distributors' operations at amounts exceeding the tangible and
identifiable intangible fair values of assets and liabilities resulting in
goodwill of $7.3 million in order to expand control over European channels for
our products and services.

       The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for our Scandinavian
distributor was based on the estimated fair value of the net liabilities of $1.9
million at the acquisition date (consisting of current assets of $2.2 million;
property, plant and equipment of $109,000; and current liabilities of $4.2
million), goodwill of $7.3 million (not deductible for tax purposes), and other
intangibles consisting of licensing agreements and acquired technology of $8.1
million which have a weighted average amortization period of approximately 5
years. The goodwill and other intangibles are included in Other assets, net on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount allocated to intangibles was
determined based on management's estimates using established valuation
techniques.

     Proforma consolidated information showing our acquisitions as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2001 and 2000 consolidated with our results of operations
for 2001 or 2000 are not material; accordingly, we have not presented them.

    We have not made any provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes
related to approximately $1.4 million of undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested. It is
not practical to determine the income tax liability, if any, which would be
payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions
of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

     6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     We lease office space and equipment under noncancelable operating lease
agreements, which expire at various dates through September 2011. Some operating
leases contain escalation provisions for adjustments in the consumer price
index. We are responsible for maintenance, insurance, and property taxes and
have five-year extension options on our primary facility leases. Future minimum
payments under the noncancelable operating leases consist of the following at
December 31, 2001 (in thousands):

     Rent expense for 2001, 2000, and 1999 was approximately $6,447,000,
$4,937,000, and $3,948,000, respectively, net of sub-rental income of $133,000,
28,000, and 28,000 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

     A European distributor and its subsidiaries that operate in certain
European locations have the exclusive right to sell our software in the European
Union, excluding certain locations, until July 1, 2004 subject to achieving
certain revenue levels. During this period the distributor also has the
contingent right to require us to purchase any one or any group of their
subsidiaries. Our requirement to purchase is contingent upon the distributor
achieving specified operating margins greater than 20% and specified customer
satisfaction criteria. The purchase price would be two times the preceding
twelve months total revenue of the purchased subsidiaries plus potential
additional consideration equal to 50% of operating margins greater than 20% that
are achieved in the two years subsequent to our acquisition. As of December 31,
2001, none of this distributor's subsidiaries have met the criteria which could
trigger this contingent right. In addition, Advent has the right to purchase any
one or any group of the distributor's subsidiaries under certain conditions. In
the event these rights are exercised by Advent or the distributor, the purchase
of these subsidiaries would principally result in an increase in intangible
assets, goodwill and amortization of intangible assets.

     On November 8, 2001, Charles Schwab & Co, Inc. ("Schwab") filed suit
against us alleging claims for declaratory relief, anticipatory breach of
contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, arising from
our intention to cease maintenance of an existing software interface that allows
institutional investment customers to download data received from Schwab's
systems into our software product used by the investment customers. We intended
to cease maintenance of the existing interface and to transition to a new, and
what we believe to be improved, software interface (the "Advent Custodial Data"
or "ACD" system). On December 11, 2001, Schwab filed a motion for preliminary
injunction seeking to enjoin us from ceasing maintenance of the existing
interface. On December 17, 2001, we filed a motion to dismiss the action and
compel arbitration of the suit. On December 24, 2001, we filed a demurrer to
Schwab's complaint, challenging the sufficiency of the allegations in Schwab's
complaint. On January 11, 2002, the court signed an order granting Schwab's
motion for preliminary injunction and denying our request for arbitration. On
January 28, 2002, the court overruled our demurrer to Schwab's complaint and
directed Schwab to answer the complaint. The parties are currently investigating
potential avenues of resolution, and we continue to evaluate the merits of
Schwab's claims and our defenses. At this time it is too early to estimate any
potential losses from this action and whether this action may have a material
impact to our results of operations.

     We are subject to other legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in
the ordinary course of business. We do not expect that the ultimate costs to
resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


     7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

     401(K) PLAN

     We have a 401(k) deferred savings plan covering substantially all
employees. Employee contributions, limited to 15% of compensation up to $10,500,
are matched 50% by us, up to 6% of employee compensation for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000 and up to a maximum of $500 per employee for 1999.
Matching contributions by us in 2001, 2000, and 1999 were approximately
$1,341,000, $1,045,000 and $157,000, respectively. In addition to the employer
matching contribution, we may make profit sharing contributions at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. We made profit sharing contributions of
approximately $472,000, $374,000 and $218,000 in 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.

<PAGE>

     All individuals employed by Advent are eligible to participate in the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("Purchase Plan") if Advent employs them for at
least 20 hours per week and at least five months per year. The Purchase Plan
permits eligible employees to purchase our Common Stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing sale price for
our Common Stock reported on the NASDAQ National Market at the beginning and the
end of each six-month offering period. In any calendar year, eligible employees
can withhold up to 10% of their salary and certain variable compensation. A
total of 900,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under
the Purchase Plan of which approximately 632,000 shares have been issued.
Approximately 69,000, 74,000, and 102,000 shares were issued through the
Purchase Plan at prices of $42.09, $29.59 and $35.80, in 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.

SECONDARY OFFERINGS

         In June 1999, we completed a secondary public offering of 3.9 million
shares of Common Stock at an offering price of $20.688 per share, excluding
offering costs. Of the 3.9 million shares of Common Stock offered, 300,000
shares were sold by a selling stockholder. The net proceeds of the offering to
us were $70.2 million.

     In August 2001, we completed a secondary public offering of 2,750,000
shares of common stock at $57.11 per share, excluding offering costs. Of the
2,750,000 shares offered, 200,000 were sold by a selling stockholder. The net
proceeds of the offering to us were approximately $138 million.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE

     In September and October 2001, we repurchased and retired 430,000 shares of
our own common stock under a program approved by our Board of Directors in March
2001 to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares from time to time. We paid $14.8
million for an average of $34.44 per share.


STOCK SPLITS

     Our Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our Common Stock
in July 1999. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend. Stockholders of
record as of the close of business on July 30, 1999 were issued a certificate
representing one additional Common Share for every two shares of Common Stock
held on the record date. These certificates were distributed on August 16, 1999.
This stock split increased the number of shares outstanding from approximately
9.6 million shares to approximately 14.4 million shares.

     Our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our Common Stock in
February 2000. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend. Stockholders of
record as of the close of business on February 28, 2000 were issued a
certificate representing one additional Common Share for each share of Common
Stock held on the record date. These certificates were distributed on March 13,
2000. The stock split increased the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
from approximately 14.8 million shares to approximately 29.6 million shares.

     All shares and per share data in these consolidated financial statements
have been adjusted to reflect both stock splits.


WARRANT

     On March 23, 2001, we issued a fully vested non-forfeitable stock purchase
warrant to purchase a total of 191,644 shares of our Common Stock to a customer
from whom we had revenue of $7.1 million, $1.2 million and $200,000 in 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively. The warrant was issued for cash consideration of
$5 million, which was the estimated Black-Scholes fair value. The warrant has an
exercise price of $45.375 per share, is immediately exercisable, and expires on
March 23, 2006.


STOCK OPTIONS

     Under our 1992 Stock Plan ("Plan") we may grant options to purchase Common
Stock to employees and consultants. Options granted may be incentive stock
options or nonstatutory stock options and shall be granted at a price not less
than fair market value on the date of grant. Fair market value (as defined in
the Plan) and the vesting of these options shall be determined by the Board of
Directors. The options generally vest over 5 years and expire no later than 10
years from the date of grant. The Plan expires on August 19, 2002. Unvested
options on termination of employment are canceled and returned to the Plan.

     The activity under the Plan was as follows:

     Options generally vest over five years, are exercisable only upon vesting,
and expire in ten years. At December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 2,726,000,
2,607,000 and 2,295,000 options outstanding were exercisable without right of
repurchase with an aggregate exercise price of $45,278,000, $30,100,000 and
$18,717,000, respectively.

     Under our Plan, we have granted to certain employees of a distributor
25,000 stock options that have an exercise price of $40, vest over 5 years and
have a term of 10 years. The options are subject to variable plan accounting,
which requires us to re-measure compensation cost for outstanding options each
reporting period based on changes in the market value of the underlying common
stock until the time the options are exercised, are forfeited or expire
unexercised. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, we recorded
$148,000 and $136,000, respectively, of stock-based charges related to these
options.

     In November 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 Nonstatutory
Stock Option Plan ("Nonstatutory Plan") and reserved 300,000 shares of Common
Stock for issuance thereunder. Under our 1998 Nonstatutory Plan, we may grant
options to purchase Common Stock to employees and consultants, excluding persons
who are executive officers and directors. Options granted are nonstatutory stock
options and shall be granted at a price not less than fair market value on the
date of grant. Fair market value (as defined in the Nonstatutory Plan) and the
vesting of these options shall be determined by the Board of Directors. The
options generally vest over 5 years and expire no later than 10 years from the
date of grant. Unvested options on termination of employment are canceled and
returned to the Nonstatutory Plan.



     The activity under the Nonstatutory Plan was as follows:

     Options generally vest over five years, are exercisable only upon vesting,

$521,000, respectively.

     Our 1995 Director Option Plan ("Director Plan") provides for the grant of
nonstatutory stock options to our non-employee directors ("Outside Directors").
Under the Director Plan, each Outside Director is granted a non-qualified option
to purchase 30,000 shares on the last to occur of the date of effectiveness of
the Director Plan or the date upon which such person first becomes a director
with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our Common Stock as of
the date of the grant. In subsequent years, each Outside Director is
automatically granted an option to purchase 6,000 shares on December 1 with an
exercise price equal to the fair value of our Common Stock on that date. Initial
options granted under the Director Plan vest one-fifth of the shares on the
first anniversary date of grant and the remaining shares vest ratably each month
over the ensuing four years. Subsequent option grants begin to vest on the
fourth anniversary of the date of grant and vest ratably each month over the
next 12 month period. All Director Plan options have a ten year term.

     No compensation cost has been recognized for our stock option plans, except
for the charges related to the options granted to employees of a distributor as
described above. If compensation had been determined based on the fair value at
the grant date for awards in 2001, 2000, and 1999 consistent with the provisions
of SFAS No. 123, our net income and net income per share for the year ended
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, would have been as follows (in

     Such pro forma disclosures may not be representative of future compensation
costs because options vest over several years and additional grants are made

     The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted were $26.32,
$31.13 and $13.16 per option for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and
1999, respectively.

     The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted average
assumptions:

                                              2001        2000         1999

Expected life                               5 years      5 years      5 years
Expected dividends                           None         None         None
Average turnover rate                          8%          8%            8%

     The fair value for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan rights were also
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes options pricing model with
the following assumptions for 2001, 2000, and 1999: risk-free interest rates of
3.7%, 6.3%, and 5.9%, respectively; dividend yield of 0%; volatility factors of
65.9%, 63.7%, and 58.7% for 2001, 2000, 1999, respectively; and a six-month
expected life. The weighted average fair value of the ESPP rights granted in
2001, 2000, and 1999 were $19.56, $15.24 and $6.52, respectively.


     10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     In February 2002, we acquired Kinexus Corporation of New York, New York.
Consideration included cash of approximately $37.8 million, a warrant to
purchase 165,176 shares of our Common Stock valued at $8.5 million, and assumed
net liabilities and acquisition costs. The warrant was calculated using the
Black-Scholes method to determine fair value, has an exercise price of $0.01 per
share, is immediately exercisable, and expires on January 1, 2003. The warrant
was exercised in February 2002. There is a potential additional earn-out
distribution to shareholders of up to $115 million in cash and stock under a
formula based on revenue and expenses. Kinexus provides internal account
aggregation and manual data management services which we will use in our Advent
TrustedNetwork service.

     In February 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan to replace our
1992 Stock Option Plan which expires in August 2002. The plan will be submitted
to our stockholders for approval at our annual stockholders' meeting in May
2002. No options have been granted under this plan.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Advent Software, Inc.:

     In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Advent Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December
31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

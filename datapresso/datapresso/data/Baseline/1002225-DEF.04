                                 PROXY STATEMENT
                       FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
                                ----------------
                               PROCEDURAL MATTERS

GENERAL

     The enclosed  Proxy is solicited on behalf of Advent  Software,  Inc.  (the
"Company") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Thursday,
May 3, 2001 at 10:00 a.m., local time, and at any adjournment  thereof,  for the
purposes set forth herein and in the  accompanying  Notice of Annual  Meeting of
Stockholders.

     The Annual Meeting will be held at the Company's  corporate  offices at 301
Brannan Street, San Francisco,  California 94107. The Company's telephone number
is (415) 543-7696.

     These proxy solicitation  materials were mailed on or about March 26, 2001,
together  with  the  Company's  2000  Annual  Report  to  Stockholders,  to  all
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting.

     Advent's  Board of Directors  approved a  three-for-two  stock split of the
Company's Common Stock paid in August 1999 and a two-for-one  stock split of the
Company's  Common Stock paid in March 2000. Both stock splits were effected as a
stock dividend.  All shares and per share data in this proxy statement have been
adjusted to reflect both stock dividends.

RECORD DATE

     Stockholders  of  record  at the  close of  business  on March 8, 2001 (the
"Record Date") are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual  Meeting.  As
of the Record Date,  approximately  30.8 million shares of the Company's  common
stock,  $.01 par value (the "Common Stock"),  were issued and  outstanding.  For
information  regarding  security  ownership by management  and by the beneficial
owners of more than 5% of the Company's Common Stock,  see "Beneficial  Security
Ownership of Management and Certain Beneficial Owners."

REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES

     Any proxy given pursuant to this  solicitation may be revoked by the person
giving it at any time  before  its use by  delivering  to the  Secretary  of the
Company at the Company's  corporate  offices a written notice of revocation or a
duly executed  proxy bearing a later date or by attending the meeting and voting
in person.

VOTING AND SOLICITATION

     Each  stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock on
all matters presented at the Annual Meeting.  Stockholders do not have the right
to cumulate their votes in the election of directors.


                                       2
<PAGE>


     The cost of soliciting  proxies will be borne by the Company.  In addition,
the  Company  may  reimburse  brokerage  firms  and other  persons  representing
beneficial  owners  of shares  for their  expenses  in  forwarding  solicitation
materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by certain of
the Company's  directors,  officers and regular  employees,  without  additional
compensation,  personally or by telephone, telegram, letter, electronic mail, or
facsimile.

QUORUM; ABSTENTIONS; BROKER NON-VOTES

     The  presence,  in person or by proxy,  of the holders of a majority of the
shares  entitled to be voted at the Annual  Meeting is necessary to constitute a
quorum at the Annual Meeting. A plurality of the votes duly cast is required for
the election of directors.  The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes duly
cast is required to ratify the appointment of auditors.

     Under the General  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,  an abstaining
vote and broker  "non-vote" are counted as present and entitled to vote and are,
therefore,  included for the purposes of determining  whether a quorum of shares
is present at a meeting.  Neither  abstentions nor broker "non-votes" effect the
election of  directors  as the votes  required is a plurality  of the votes duly
cast. Abstaining votes and broker "non-votes" are not deemed to be "votes cast."
As a result,  while  abstentions are deemed to be "votes cast" and will have the
effect of votes in opposition of any given proposal,  broker "non-votes" are not
included  in the  tabulation  of the  voting  results  on issues  requiring  the
approval of a majority of the votes cast.  They therefore do not have the effect
of votes in opposition in such tabulations.

     A broker  "non-vote"  occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial
owner does not vote on a particular  proposal  because the nominee does not have
discretionary  voting  power  with  respect  to that  item and has not  received
instructions from the beneficial owner.

DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

     Proposals of stockholders of the Company which are intended to be presented
by such  stockholders at the Company's 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders  must
be received by the Company at its  corporate  offices no later than  December 4,
2001 in order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy  statement and form of
proxy relating to that meeting.

                                 PROPOSAL NO. 1

                              ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
NOMINEES

     The Company's  Bylaws  authorize a Board of six  directors.  A board of six
directors is to be elected at the Annual Meeting.  Unless otherwise  instructed,
the proxy  holders will vote the proxies  received by them for the Company's six
nominees named below.  In the event that any nominee of the Company is unable or
declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual  Meeting,  the proxies
will be voted for any nominee who shall be  designated  by the present  Board of
Directors  to fill the  vacancy.  It is not  expected  that any nominee  will be
unable or will decline to serve as a director. The term of office of each person
elected  as  a  director  will  continue   until  the  next  Annual  Meeting  of
Stockholders or until a successor has been elected and qualified.

BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES

     The Board of Directors  held a total of six meetings  (including  regularly
scheduled and special meetings) during fiscal 2000. No incumbent director during
the last fiscal year,  while a member of the Board of Directors,  attended fewer
than 75% of (i) the total  number of meetings of the Board of  Directors or (ii)
the total  number of  meetings  held by all  committees  on which such  director
served.

     The Board of Directors of the Company has two standing committees: an Audit
Committee and a Compensation  Committee. It does not have a nominating committee
or a committee performing the functions of a nominating committee.

     The Audit Committee,  which currently consists of Messrs. Van Auken, Zuendt
and Zweben,  is  responsible  for assisting the Board of Directors in monitoring
(i)  the  integrity  of the  financial  statements  of  the  Company,  (ii)  the
compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory  requirements  and (iii) the
independence  and  performance  of the Company's  external  auditors.  The Audit
Committee held one meeting during fiscal 2000.

     The Compensation  Committee,  which currently consists of Messrs.  Robinson
and Van Auken, is responsible  for (i) reviewing and approving the  compensation
and benefits for the Company's officers and other employees,  (ii) administering
the  Company's  stock  purchase  and  stock  option  plans,   and  (iii)  making
recommendations  to  the  Board  of  Directors   regarding  such  matters.   The
Compensation Committee held one meeting during fiscal 2000.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

     Directors  who are  employees  of the  Company  do not  receive  additional
compensation   for  their  services  as  directors  of  the  Company.   However,
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors receive an annual cash retainer of
$5,000 and $1,250 for  attendance  at each  meeting of the Board of Directors or
any committee thereof.

     In  addition,  nonemployee  directors  participate  in the  Company's  1995
Director  Option Plan (the "Director  Plan").  The Director Plan was approved by
the Board in October 1995 and was ratified by  stockholders in November 1995, at
which time a total of 225,000  shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance
thereunder.  The  Director  Plan  was  amended  in May  2000 to  provide  for an
additional   200,000  shares  of  Common  stock  to  be  reserved  for  issuance
thereunder.  As of March 8, 2001, there were 194,000 options  outstanding  under
the  Director  Plan.  The  Director  Plan  became  effective  on the date of the
Company's  initial  public  offering  on November  15,  1995,  and is  currently
administered  by  the  Board  of  Directors.   Under  the  Director  Plan,  each
nonemployee director is automatically granted a non-qualified option to purchase
30,000  shares on the date upon which such person first  becomes a director (the
"Initial  Option") with an exercise  price equal to the fair market value of the
Company's  Common Stock as of the date of grant.  Thereafter,  each  nonemployee
director is  automatically  granted an option to purchase 6,000 shares of Common
Stock on December  1st of each year,  except in the year the  Director  Plan was
adopted (a "Subsequent Option"), provided he or she has served as a director for
at least six months as of such date.

     Options  granted  under the  Director  Plan have a term of ten years unless
terminated  sooner upon  termination of the  optionee's  status as a director or
otherwise  pursuant to the Director Plan.  Such options


                                       5
<PAGE>


are transferable by the optionee only in certain limited  circumstances and each
option is exercisable  during the lifetime of the director only by such director
or a permitted transferee.  Initial Options granted under the Director Plan vest
as to one-fifth (1/5) of the shares on the first  anniversary date of grant and,
as to the  remaining  shares,  ratably  each month over the ensuing  four years.
Subsequent  Options begin to vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant
and vest ratably each month over the next 12 month period.  The Director Plan is
designed to work automatically,  without administration;  however, to the extent
administration  is  necessary,  the Director  Plan has been  structured  so that
options  granted to nonemployee  directors who  administer  the Company's  other
employee  benefit plans shall qualify as transactions  exempt from Section 16(b)
of the  Securities  and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Exchange  Act"),
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder.

REQUIRED VOTE

     The six nominees  receiving the highest number of affirmative  votes of the
shares present or represented and entitled to be voted for them shall be elected
as directors, whether or not such affirmative votes constitute a majority of the
shares  voted.  Votes  withheld  from any  director  are counted for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business,
but they have no legal effect under Delaware law.

         MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE NOMINEES LISTED ABOVE.


                                 PROPOSAL NO. 2

             RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

     The Board of Directors has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
accountants,  to audit the  financial  statements  of the Company for the fiscal
year  ending  December  31,  2001.  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP has  audited the
Company's    financial    statements   since   1989.   A    representative    of
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP is  expected  to be present at the  meeting and will
have the  opportunity  to make a  statement,  and is expected to be available to
respond to appropriate questions.

        FEES TO ACCOUNTANTS FOR SERVICES RENDERED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2000

AUDIT FEES:
Audit  fees  billed to the  Company  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP  during the
Company's  2000  fiscal  year for the audit of the  Company's  annual  financial
statements  incorporated  by  reference  on  Form  10-k  and the  review  of the
Company's  financial  statements  included in the Company's quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q totaled $135,000.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION FEES:
The Company did not engage  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP to provide advice to the
Company regarding financial information systems design and implementation during
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000.

ALL OTHER FEES:
Fees billed to the Company by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP during the  Company's
2000  fiscal year for all other  non-audit  services  rendered  to the  Company,

REQUIRED VOTE

     Stockholder ratification of the selection of  PricewatehouseCoopers  LLP as
the Company's  independent  public  accountants is not required by the Company's
Bylaws,  or other applicable  legal  requirement.  However,  as a matter of good
corporate  practice,  the Board of Directors has  conditioned its appointment of
the Company's  independent  accountants upon the receipt of the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shares  represented,  in person or by proxy,  and voting at
the Annual Meeting, which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a
majority  of the  required  quorum.  In the event that the  stockholders  do not
approve the  selection of  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, the  appointment  of the
independent  accountants  will be  reconsidered  by the Audit  Committee and the
Board  of  Directors.  Even if the  selection  is  ratified,  the  Board  at its
discretion  and  at  the  direction  of  the  Audit  Committee  may  direct  the
appointment of a different  independent  accounting  firm at any time during the
year if it determines  that such a change would be in the best  interests of the
Company and its stockholders.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION
OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AS INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS FOR
FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2001.

                COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

     Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act ("Section  16(a)") requires the Company's
officers  and  directors,  and  persons  who own  more  than  ten  percent  of a
registered  class  of the  Company's  equity  securities,  to  file  reports  of
ownership  on Form 3 and  changes  in  ownership  on  Form 4 or Form 5 with  the
Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") and the National  Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Such officers,  directors and ten-percent  stockholders
are also  required by SEC rules to furnish  the Company  with copies of all such
forms that they file.

     Based  solely on its  review of the copies of such  forms  received  by the
Company,  or written  representations  from certain  reporting  persons that all
Forms 5 required for such persons were filed,  the Company  believes that during
fiscal 2000 all Section  16(a) filing  requirements  applicable to its officers,
directors and ten-percent stockholders were complied with.

           COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

     The  Company's  Compensation  Committee  was formed in October  1995 and is
currently   composed  of  Messrs.   Robinson  and  Van  Auken.  No  interlocking
relationship  exists  between any member of the Company's  Board of Directors or
Compensation  Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation
committee  of any  other  Company,  nor has any such  interlocking  relationship
existed in the past. No member of the Compensation  Committee is or was formerly
an officer or an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries.

     During 1998 and 2000,  Mr.  Frank H.  Robinson,  a director of the Company,
served  as  a  consultant  to  the  Company  and  was  paid  $890  and  $41,065,
respectively,  in consulting fees for his services.  No consulting services were
performed by him in 1999.

     The Company has entered into  indemnification  agreements  with each of its
directors and officers.  Such  agreements  require the Company to indemnify such
individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law.

(1)   All options in this table were  granted  under the 1992 Stock  Option Plan
      and have  exercise  prices  equal to the fair market  value on the date of
      grant.  All such  options  have  ten-year  terms and vest  monthly  over a
      five-year period.
(2)   The Company granted options to purchase 1,174,200 shares of Common Stock
      to employees in fiscal 2000.
(3)   Options may terminate  before their  expiration  upon the  termination  of
      optionee's status as an employee or consultant, the optionee's death or an
      acquisition of the Company.
(4)   Potential realizable value assumes that the stock price increases from the
      exercise price from the date of grant until the end of the option term (10
      years) at the  annual  rate  specified  (5% and 10%).  Annual  compounding
      results in total appreciation of approximately  62.9% (at 5% per year) and
      159.4% (at 10% per year).  The assumed  annual rates of  appreciation  are
      specified  in SEC rules and do not  represent  the  Company's  estimate or
      projection of future stock price growth.  The Company does not necessarily
      agree that this method can properly determine the value of an option.

         REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The  Compensation  Committee  of the Board of Directors  (the  "Committee")
consists of directors  Frank H.  Robinson  and Wendell G. Van Auken,  neither of
whom is an employee or officer of the  Company.  The  Committee  sets policy and
administers the Company's cash and equity incentive  programs for the purpose of
attracting  and  retaining  highly  skilled  executives  who  will  promote  the
Company's business goals and build long-term stockholder value. The Committee is
also  responsible  for  reviewing  and  making  recommendations  to the Board of
Directors  regarding all forms of  compensation  to be provided to the executive
officers and directors of the Company,  including stock  compensation and loans,
and all bonus and stock compensation to all employees.

     To the extent appropriate,  the Company intends to take the necessary steps
to conform its compensation practices to comply with the $1 million compensation
deduction  cap under  Section  162(m) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as
amended.

COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND POLICIES

     The policy of the Committee is to attract and retain key personnel  through
the payment of competitive base salaries and to encourage and reward performance
through bonuses and stock ownership. The Committee's objectives are to:

o    ensure  that the  executive  team has clear goals and  accountability  with
     respect to corporate performance;

o    establish  pay  opportunities  that are  competitive  based  on  prevailing
     practices for the industry,  the stage of growth,  and the labor markets in
     which the Company operates;

o    independently  assess  operating  results  on a  regular  basis in light of
     expected Company performance; and

o    align  pay  incentives  with  the  long-term  interests  of  the  Company's
     stockholders.

ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION

     Compensation  for officers and key employees  includes both cash and equity
elements.

     Cash compensation consists of base salary, which is determined by the level
of  responsibility,  expertise and experience of the employee,  and  competitive
conditions  in the  industry.  The  Committee  believes that the salaries of its
officers fall within the software  industry norm. In addition,  cash bonuses may
be awarded to officers and other key employees.  Compensation of sales personnel
also includes sales commissions tied to annual and quarterly targets.

     Ownership  of the  Company's  Common  Stock is a key  element of  executive
compensation.  Officers  and other  employees  of the  Company  are  eligible to
participate  in the 1992 Stock Plan (the  "Option  Plan") and the 1995  Employee
Stock  Purchase  Plan (the  "Purchase  Plan"),  which were adopted  prior to the
Company's  initial public offering in November 1995. The Option Plan permits the
Board of Directors or the  Committee to grant stock options to employees on such
terms as the Board or the  Committee may  determine.  The Committee has the sole
authority  to grant  stock  options to  executive  officers  of the  Company and
currently administers stock option grants to employees.  In determining the size
of a stock option grant to a new officer or other key  employee,  the  Committee
takes into account  equity  participation  by  comparable  employees  within the
Company,   external  competitive   circumstances


                                       12
<PAGE>

and other  relevant  factors.  Additional  options  may be  granted  to  current
employees to reward exceptional  performance or to provide  additional  unvested
equity  incentives.  The Purchase Plan permits employees to acquire Common Stock
of the Company  through  payroll  deductions  and  promotes  broad-based  equity
participation  throughout  the Company.  The Committee  believes that such stock
plans align the interests of the employees  with the long-term  interests of the
stockholders.

     The Company  also  maintains a 401(k) Plan to provide  retirement  benefits
through  tax  deferred  salary  deductions  for  all  its  employees.   Employee
contributions,  limited to 15% of compensation up to $10,500, are matched 50% by
the  Company,  up to 6% of employee  compensation.  In addition to the  employer
matching  contribution,  Advent may make a profit  sharing  contribution  to the
401(k) Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

2000 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     Executive compensation for 2000 included base salary, cash and equity-based
incentive compensation and, in the case of sales executives,  sales commissions.
Cash  incentive  compensation  is  designed  to  motivate  executives  to attain
corporate, business unit and individual goals. The Company's policy is to have a
significant  portion of an executive's  total  compensation at risk based on the
Company's overall performance.  Executive officers,  like other employees,  were
eligible for option grants under the Option Plan.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

     Compensation  for the Chief  Executive  Officer is  determined by a process
similar to that  discussed  above for executive  officers.  The Chief  Executive
Officer's  target  base pay level has been  analyzed  using data for  comparable
software  companies.  Mr.  Caswell  receives no other material  compensation  or
benefits not provided to all executive officers,  except for the loan previously
referred to under "Certain Transactions."

     The Committee has considered the potential  impact of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which limits the tax deductibility of
cash  compensation  paid to  individual  executive  officers  to $1 million  per
officer. The cash compensation to be paid to the Company's executive officers in
fiscal  2000 is not  expected  to exceed  the $1  million  limit per  individual
officer.

             REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors  (the "Audit  Committee") is
responsible for assisting the Board in monitoring the integrity of the financial
statements  of the  Company,  the  compliance  of the  Company  with  legal  and
regulatory  requirements  and the  independence and performance of the Company's
external auditors.  The Audit Committee consists of three independent directors,
Wendell G. Van Auken,  William F.  Zuendt  and Monte  Zweben,  appointed  by the
Board,  who, in the opinion of the Board,  meet the  independence and experience
requirements of the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  The Audit Committee is
governed by a written charter adopted and approved by the Board, a copy of which
is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A.

     The  responsibilities  of the Audit Committee  include  recommending to the
Board an accounting  firm to serve as the  Company's  independent  auditor.  The
Audit  Committee  also,  as  appropriate,  reviews,  discusses and consults with
Company management and the independent auditor regarding the following:

o    the plan for, and the  independent  auditor's  report on, each audit of the
     Company's financial statements

o    the  Company's  financial  disclosure  documents,  including  all financial
     statements and reports filed with the SEC or sent to shareholders,  as well
     as the adequacy of the Company's internal controls that could significantly
     affect the Company's financial statements

o    major  changes in the  Company's  auditing and  accounting  principles  and
     practices, or in the Company's financial statements

o    the auditor's  independence,  including the provision of non-audit services
     to the Company, and the fees paid to the independent auditor

o    legal matters that may have a material  impact on the  Company's  financial
     statements,  including the Company's  compliance  policies and any material
     reports or inquiries received from regulators or governmental agencies

     The Audit Committee is responsible  for  recommending to the Board that the
Company's  financial  statements be included in the Company's annual report.  In
connection with the audited financial statements contained in the Company's 2000
Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Audit Committee:

o    discussed  with   PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  the  Company's  independent
     auditors,  those matters  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP  communicated  to and
     discussed with the Audit Committee  under  applicable  auditing  standards,
     including information concerning the scope and results of the audit;

o    discussed      PricewaterhouseCoopers      LLP's      independence     with
     PricewaterhouseCoopers     LLP    and     received     a    letter     from
     PricewaterhouseCoopers   LLP  regarding   independence  as  required  under
     applicable independence standards for auditors of public companies;

o    considered    whether   the    provision   of    non-audit    services   by
     PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP is compatible with maintaining it independence;
     and

o    reviewed and discussed, with Company management and  PricewaterhouseCoopers
     LLP, the Company's audited consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2000
     and 1999, and consolidated  statements of income and comprehensive  income,
     stockholder's  equity and cash flows for the three years ended December 31,
     2000.

Based on the discussions with  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP concerning the audit,
the independence discussions, and the financial statement review, and additional
matters  deemed  relevant  and  appropriate  by the Audit  Committee,  the Audit
Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
include these financial statements.

2.   Review,  before release,  the audited financial statements and Management's
     Discussion  and Analysis in the  Company's  Annual Report on Form 10-K with

     Committee,  recommend  that the Board  take  appropriate  action to satisfy
     itself of the independence of the auditor.

9.   Meet with the independent auditor prior to the audit to review the planning
     and staffing of the audit.

     Commission to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement.

12.  Review with the  Company's  general  counsel  legal matters that may have a

     governmental agencies.

13.  Meet at least annually with the chief financial officer and the independent
     auditor in separate executive sessions.

to determine that the Company's  financial  statements are complete and accurate
and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

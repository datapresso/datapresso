PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

Overview

  We are a leading provider of Enterprise  Investment  Management solutions that
automate  and  integrate  mission-critical  functions of  investment  management
organizations  through software  products,  services and data  integration.  Our
solutions  enable  organizations  of  all  sizes  to  run  their  business  more
effectively,  enhance client service and performance,  and improve  productivity
and communication throughout their organization.

  Advent Office(TM),  our suite of integrated products,  addresses the demand to
automate  the  entire  range  of  investment  management  functions,   including
portfolio management,  client relationship  management,  trade order management,
data  warehousing,   partnership  accounting,   reconciliation  management,  and
web-based portfolio, performance and analytic reporting.

  We were founded in 1983, incorporated in 1983 in California and reincorporated
in Delaware in November 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 301
Brannan Street,  San Francisco,  California  94107,  and our telephone number is
(415) 543-7696.

Industry Background and Our Clients

          Our clients include a range of  organizations  that manage  investment
portfolios,  including  investment  advisors,  brokerage firms,  banks and hedge
funds.  Our  clients  also  include  corporations,  public  funds,  foundations,
universities and non-profit  organizations that manage investment portfolios and
perform  similar  portfolio  management  functions.   Recently,  the  investment
management industry has experienced  significant  growth,  which, in combination
with other  factors,  has led to  increasing  demand for software  products that
automate,   simplify  and  integrate  functions  within  investment   management
organizations.  This increasing  demand is driven by several industry  dynamics.
Financial assets under management have increased  substantially  during the last
decade.  As the value of total financial  assets under management has increased,
there has been a  substantial  increase in the number of  investment  management
organizations and a steady introduction of increasingly  sophisticated financial
instruments.  As a  result,  investment  managers  are faced  with  increasingly
complicated  portfolio  accounting  and  management   requirements  as  well  as
extensive and evolving industry standards and government regulations.
<PAGE>
  These dynamics have  increased the volume and  complexity of  information  and
data  flows  within  investment   management   organizations  and  between  such
organizations and third parties, such as brokerage firms,  clients,  custodians,
banks,  pricing  services  and other data  providers.  Consequently,  investment
management  organizations  require more  sophisticated  and integrated  software
products for their front, middle and back offices.

  The front office operations of an investment manager include the marketing and
customer  relationship  management aspect of dealing with customers;  the middle
office  focuses on trade order  management  and trading  workflow;  and the back
office  includes  the  accounting  functions  of the  organization.  In order to
operate efficiently within this environment, investment management organizations
must  automate  and  integrate  their   mission-critical   and   labor-intensive
functions,  including (i) investment  decision  support and client  relationship
management,  (ii) order  management and trading and (iii) portfolio  accounting,
performance measurement, report generation and compliance. Investment management
organizations   historically  have  relied  on  internally   developed  systems,
timesharing services or simple  spreadsheet-based  systems to manage information
flows. Due to inherent limitations in each of these types of systems, investment
management organizations are demanding highly functional, easy-to-use, scalable,
cost-effective  and flexible  software  applications that automate and integrate
their mission-critical business functions.

The Advent Solution

  The  Advent  solution  combines  a fully  integrated  suite of  client-centric
software  products,   with  a  full  range  of  professional   services  -  from
implementation  management  and  training to  technical  support and  consulting
services, all aimed at accomplishing our clients' business objectives.

Software Products

  We  offer  an  integrated  suite  of  software  products  for  automating  and
integrating work and data flows across the investment  management  organization,
as well as the information flows between the investment management  organization
and external parties.  Our products are intended to reduce client costs, improve
the accuracy of client  information and generally  enable clients to improve the
service  they provide to their  customers  rather than  focusing on  operational
details.  Each software  component in the Advent Office suite focuses on certain
mission-critical  functions  of the  investment  management  organization.  Each
Advent  Office  implementation  is  tailored  to meet the needs of a  particular
market segment, as determined by size, assets under management and complexity of
the investment environment.

  We believe that our Enterprise  Investment  Management solution is well suited
for  the  investment   management  functions  of  corporations,   public  funds,
partnerships,   foundations,   universities  and  non-profit  organizations.  An
Enterprise  Investment  Management  solution  is an  evolutionary  process  that
encompasses three phases:

o    Investment Process Integration - involves the integration of front-,  mid-,
     and  back-office  components  with  each  other  as well  as with  standard
     productivity  applications  such as Microsoft  Word(R) and  Excel(R).  This
     integration  eliminates  ineffective  communication  between  processes and
     minimizes processing errors, enabling growth by reducing bottlenecks within
     the organization.

o    Data Collection and Reconciliation - enables the investment organization to
     integrate the external data regarding  pricing and  settlements so that the
     firm  can  quickly  and  efficiently   settle   transactions   and  monitor
     performance in an automated fashion.

o    Customer  Responsiveness - incorporates  numerous capabilities enabling our
     clients  to  provide  more  personal,  effective  communication  with their
     customers.  This  capability  enables  decision makers for the firm to have
     timely access to information  in order to make more effective  decisions on
     behalf of the clients.

Back Office

  We offer three portfolio  accounting and management systems:  Axys(R),  Advent
Partner(R)  and  Geneva(R),  each  targeted at a different  market  segment,  to
automate  the back  office  functions.  We also  offer  additional  back  office
applications,  including our REX(TM)  solution,  which  provides  reconciliation
management,   and  our  Advent  Warehouse(TM)  solution,   which  provides  data
warehousing capabilities.
<PAGE>
  Axys, our core product,  introduced in 1993, is a highly functional  portfolio
accounting  and  management  system  targeted  towards   investment   management
organizations of all sizes. Axys provides  investment  professionals  with broad
portfolio  accounting  functionality,  timely  decision  support,  sophisticated
performance  measurement  and  flexible  reporting.  Specifically,  clients  can
record, account for and report on a variety of investment instruments, including
equities,  fixed income, mutual funds and cash. Axys users gain access on demand
to portfolio  holdings,  asset  allocation,  realized and  unrealized  gains and
losses,   actual  and  projected  income  and  other  valuable  data.  Portfolio
performance can be measured for individual portfolios or related groups, and for
any specified  time period.  Investment  professionals  can choose from over 200
pre-defined reports with flexible "as-of" reporting,  which can be customized as
to formats and fonts.  Clients can easily generate fully customized reports with
the   assistance   of  the  Axys  Report   Writer.   Clients  can  also  produce
presentation-quality  graphics via an  integrated  link with  Microsoft  Excel's
charting  capability.   In  addition,  Axys  offers  integrated   multi-currency
capabilities  which,  among other things,  allows  reports to be restated in any
currency,   tracks  reclaimable   foreign  withholding  tax,  and  can  identify
components  of  return  attributable  to  market  prices  versus  currency  rate
fluctuations.

  Axys also provides  integration  with a variety of investment  tools and data.
These tools  include (i)  Moxy(R),  our trade order  management  solution,  (ii)
pricing,  corporate  actions,  analytics and fundamental  data via interfaces to
data  vendors,  (iii)  automatic  data entry and  reconciliation  of trades with
interfaces to the Depository  Trust  Corporation  ("DTC"),  brokerage  firms and
custodians, (iv) integrating through the Internet via our custodial data service
and software and (vi) Internet  reporting via Advent  Browser  Reporting(R)  for
Enterprise Users, our Internet reporting service.

  Advent  Partner,  introduced in December  1996,  is an investment  partnership
allocation  solution,  which  integrates with Axys. This product is specifically
designed for hedge funds, venture funds and limited investment partnerships that
face  the  complex  and  time-consuming  task  of  consistently  and  accurately
accounting for and reporting on partnership tax allocation and other activities.
The  Windows-based  system  tracks  partner-specific  information,  handles  the
complexities  of  allocating  realized and  unrealized  gains and losses for tax
purposes,  allocates  performance incentive fees, provides on-demand partner and
partnership reporting on an economic or tax allocation basis and streamlines the
production of partnership tax returns.

  Geneva,  introduced  to  target  organizations  in 1995 and made  commercially
available in October 1997, is a high-end portfolio accounting system designed to
meet  the  needs of  large,  global  investment  management  organizations  with
complex,  international  accounting  requirements.  Geneva  offers  feature-rich
global accounting,  extensive reporting  (including profit and loss reporting by
strategy) and sophisticated multi-currency  capabilities.  In addition, Geneva's
highly flexible design allows users to add newly created  financial  instruments
and tailor accounting treatments to their specific needs.

  REX,  introduced in the second quarter of 1997, is the Advent Office  solution
for reconciliation  management.  REX is integrated with Axys and is designed for
firms that want to electronically reconcile their Axys information against their
custodial   information.   REX  automates  matching  and  helps  users  identify
exceptions,  correct or add  transactions to their portfolios or communicate and
track changes required by their custodian.

  Advent Warehouse, introduced in 1998, is a data warehouse solution designed to
allow investment  professionals to readily access  investment data regardless of
how the data was created or  maintained,  without  impacting the  performance of
their high volume transaction-based Advent Office systems. Relational technology
and data  warehousing  tools  provide an open  environment  for ad hoc  decision
support and  customized  reporting on enterprise  wide  investment  information.
Investment  professionals can take advantage of the sea of information  captured
during the investment  process to improve  client  service and gain  competitive
advantage.

  Advent  Corporate  Actions(TM),  introduced in May 1999,  is a  comprehensive,
integrated  corporate  actions  solution from our  subsidiary,  Hub Data, and is
designed to integrate with Axys to automate and simplify the process of manually
tracking  and   processing   corporate   actions.   Advent   Corporate   Actions
electronically tracks and consolidates  corporate action information from a host
of high-quality  sources and delivers daily e-mail reports to portfolio managers
and other key staff.

  MyAdvent(TM),  introduced  in May 2000 and  expected to be  available in 2001,
will  provide  a   browser-based   portal  to  Advent   Office  for   investment
professionals  to quickly  view  summary  information  they need in one place in
order to know  exactly  where they stand at any point in the day.  Users will be
able to review  information then  immediately  drill down into detailed data and
functionality in other Advent Office components,  and in Advent Alliance Partner
applications.
<PAGE>
  Advent  Outsource,  introduced in September 2000, is a service that brings our
portfolio  reporting  solution to  investment  firms in an  application  service
provider ("ASP") model.  Investment  management firms that wish to outsource the
management of their portfolio  reporting will be able to leverage the full power
of Axys, our portfolio accounting, management and reporting solution. Investment
firms that choose Advent  Outsource will have their client data housed for them,
and will be provided secure access over the Internet to their accounts. This ASP
solution  is  especially  attractive  to firms  that may not have the  resources
required to maintain technology  operations in-house or are looking specifically
to outsource all of their data management.

Middle Office

  Moxy,  introduced  in 1995,  automates and  streamlines  the trading and order
management  process.  Moxy  facilitates  accurate  trade  order  management  and
preparation, tracks trade-order status, automates the allocation of block trades
across multiple portfolios and electronically interfaces with Axys to provide an
integrated solution. Moxy supports fixed income, mutual funds and equity trading
and offers  multi-currency  capabilities.  Moxy enables  investment  managers to
accurately  adjust  portfolio  holdings,  rebalance  portfolios  against models,
interactively  assess "what-if" scenarios and automatically  create orders to be
executed.  For traders,  Moxy tracks cash and positions  during the trading day,
enables the accurate  preparation of block trades and internal  electronic trade
tickets,   facilitates  compliance  with  investment  restrictions  and  trading
requirements and minimizes  trading errors.  Moxy also allows traders and others
to view the status of orders via customizable screens and maintain an electronic
audit trail of the trade  process.  Moxy  automates  the  allocation  process of
partial and complete  executions and allows the user to send allocation  results
using OASYS,  an electronic  allocation  system,  to communicate  allocations to
brokers  electronically.  Moxy also  provides  Internet-ready  electronic  order
routing based on the industry standard FIX messaging protocol so that Moxy users
can route trades  electronically to any FIX-compliant broker or crossing network
that supports the Internet or other TCP/IP connections. Moxy users can choose to
route equity  orders via SunGard  Direct(TM)  which links them to  participating
brokers  and  execution  venues.  Trades are  executed,  processed,  settled and
accounted for without manual  intervention.  Moxy electronically posts allocated
trades into Axys on demand,  eliminating  time-consuming  and error-prone manual
entry.

Front Office

  Qube(R),  introduced  in 1995,  is designed to help  securities  professionals
develop  and improve  client  relationships  by  automating  scheduling,  client
communications  and client data.  For example,  Qube  integrates  with portfolio
information on Axys and enables investment professionals to interactively screen
client  investment  profiles and notes of conversations to identify  appropriate
candidates for various investment  opportunities.  In addition, Qube can be used
to  enhance  direct   marketing   campaigns  by  matching  clients  with  market
opportunities.  Qube captures  extensive  investment  profile  information,  has
online query  capability,  networking  features and mail merge  capabilities and
facilitates information sharing across professionals in an office.

  Advent Browser  Reporting for Decision  Makers,  introduced in 1998,  puts the
power of data  analysis on the  portfolio  managers'  desktop via the  Internet.
Using our Online  Analytical  Processing  tools (OLAP),  investment  data can be
sliced  and  diced to  improve  the  decision  making  process.  Advent  Browser
Reporting for Investors,  also introduced in 1998, allows investment managers to
post Axys  reports to a secure  website  where their  clients  can access  these
reports 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Advent Browser  Reporting for Enterprise
Users  allows  investment  professionals  the ability to access Axys from remote
locations via the Internet and run Axys reports as if they were in their office.

  Advent  TrustedNetworkSM,  introduced in March 2000,  is an automated  account
consolidation  solution that enables financial  institutions to use the Internet
to  deliver  cross-institutional,  consolidated  views  of  individual  investor
portfolios. The investment advisors can provide a consolidated statement showing
the individual  investor's  portfolio of assets,  transaction data (buys, sells,
interest, dividends,  deposits and withdrawals),  performance analysis and other
detailed  account  information.  The  data  can  be  manipulated  and  new  data
interpolated   from  it.  The  consolidated   information  can  then  be  shared
simultaneously  between investors and trusted financial advisors.  Our solution,
in contrast  to account  aggregation  solutions,  is designed to employ our data
gathering and reporting  tools to accept account and  transactional  information
from bank and brokerage back office  systems,  aggregate  those  transactions by
investor,  and deliver the information to  participating  institutions and their
clients online.
<PAGE>
Grants Management

  GIFTS(R) for Windows is a proposal  tracking and grants management system that
allows  the  user to  retrieve  and  classify  requests,  generate  personalized
letters,  manage contacts,  schedule and monitor  activities,  maintain complete
organization history,  track payments,  contingencies and report requests.  This
software is primarily used by the  philanthropic  community such as foundations,
corporations and other organizations to manage their grant-making activities.


Maintenance Support and Subscription-Based/Transaction-Based Services

  We earn recurring  revenues by offering a choice of maintenance  contracts and
by   providing    subscription-based   and   transaction-based   services.   Our
subscription-based and transaction-based  services allow clients to (1) download
pricing,  corporate  actions  and other data from third  party  vendors  such as
Interactive  Data  Corporation  ("Interactive  Data"),  a wholly owned  indirect
subsidiary of Pearson plc, and (2) interface with DTC,  certain  brokerage firms
and custodians  for trading  activity.  Many of our clients use our  proprietary
interface to  electronically  retrieve  pricing and other data from  Interactive
Data. Interactive Data pays us a commission based on Interactive Data's revenues
from providing such data to our clients.

  Our Hub Data  subsidiary  consolidates  securities  information  and data from
various third party  providers such as Merrill  Lynch,  Interactive  Data,  J.J.
Kenny,  a division  of The  McGraw-Hill  Companies,  Xcitek,  CCH  Incorporated,
Telekurs  and  others,  and  provides  data  feeds  and  services  to a range of
financial  institutions  via electronic  interfaces to many  portfolio  software
systems.

  Due to the  mission-critical  nature of our  products,  many clients  purchase
annual  maintenance  contracts,  which  entitle  them to  technical  support and
product upgrades as they become  available.  We continually  upgrade and enhance
our  products  to  respond  to  changing  market  needs,   evolving   regulatory
requirements and new technologies.

Internet Initiative

  We believe the Internet  will be a low-cost  communications  platform  used to
integrate external information into our products,  thereby providing our clients
with  straight  through  processing  ("STP") of  business  information.  To take
advantage of the Internet,  we have launched an Internet Initiative,  developing
services,  both announced and unannounced,  to bring Internet-based products and
services to our clients.  We launched REX, our first Internet service during the
second quarter of 1997. Using the Internet,  REX consolidates  communication and
information from all participating  custodians,  enabling our clients to quickly
and easily  reconcile  transactions  and holdings with a click of the mouse. Our
second Internet-based product, Advent Browser Reporting, was introduced in 1998.
Advent  Browser  Reporting  is a reporting  component  of Advent  Office,  which
enables  users to access  Advent Office  information  through a web browser.  In
1999, we introduced Advent Corporate Actions,  an  enterprise-wide  notification
service that automates and simplifies the process of tracking  corporate actions
such as mergers, spin-offs and bankruptcies. We announced several Internet-based
products and services  during 2000  including:  Advent  Outsource,  MyAdvent and
Advent TrustedNetwork.  Advent Outsource brings our portfolio reporting solution
to investment firms in an ASP model.  MyAdvent is a browser-based  portal to the
Advent Office suite.  Advent  TrustedNetwork  enables financial  institutions to
deliver   cross-institutional,   consolidated   views  of  individual   investor
portfolios across the Internet.

  Additionally we have added Distance Learning and Advent  Connection.  Distance
Learning is Advent's online  interactive  classroom  offering education services
via the Internet.  Now our clients can  participate in an interactive  education
session with a certified  Advent  instructor  from their office or home.  Advent
Connection is our  client-only  website which  provides  technical  information,
support,  educational  offerings,  discussion  groups and a software center that
allows our clients to download free client reports.

  From time to time, as we begin the  development  of new products and services,
including our Internet Initiative, we plan to continue to enter into development
agreements with information  providers,  clients, or other companies in order to
accelerate the delivery of new products and services.

Alliance Program

  Our Alliance  Program was launched in May 1998 and is designed to benefit both
our clients and our  partners.  The program  provides a formal  process  through
which partners can develop,  promote,  and sell their  products,  services,  and
solutions in conjunction  with our suite of  applications.  Our Alliance Program
was created to further extend our breadth of product and service offerings.
<PAGE>
Professional Services

  Professional  services  consist  of  consulting,   implementation  management,
integration  management,  custom  report  writing,  and  training.  To  ensure a
successful product  implementation,  consultants assist clients with the initial
installation  of a system,  assist in the conversion of the client's  historical
data and provide  ongoing  training and  education.  Consulting  services may be
required for as little as two days for small systems or for up to many weeks for
large implementations. We believe that consulting services facilitate a client's
early success with our products, strengthen the relationship with the client and
generate valuable feedback for us.

  Implementation  management  provides a single  point-of-contact  who will work
closely with our client's project team to plan the  implementation,  to optimize
the use of our products,  to coordinate Advent  resources,  to advocate on their
behalf,  and to  minimize  schedule  delays  and  project  risks.  Additionally,
implementation  managers  provide  documentation  for  the  implementation  from
planning through production.

  Integration  management  provides services to clients with more complex needs.
Integration  managers work with clients to integrate their systems and workflows
with our products during  implementation.  The services include:  development of
custom  interfaces  from  back-office  systems  to our Axys  and Moxy  products,
configuration  and  management  of large  volumes of data,  and  strategies  for
deployment of our products for distributed sites.

  We provide our clients with custom report writing services that enable clients
to tailor end-user reports to their own specifications. We also provide training
sessions to our clients at various  sites across the country.  Additionally,  we
host semi-annual  conferences in the United States,  as well as Australasian and
European  conferences,  that provide product  information and user workshops for
our clients.

Clients

  Our clients vary significantly in size and assets under management and include
investment advisors,  brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds, corporations,  public
funds, universities and non-profit  organizations.  At present, we have licensed
products to over 6,000  institutions in 45 countries for use by more than 60,000
concurrent users.

Sales and Marketing

   Sales

  We license and sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales
organization comprised of field sales and telesales  representatives.  Our field
sales force is organized by geographic  region and is primarily  responsible for
selling our suite of  products  to  mid-sized  and large  investment  management
organizations. We have sales offices in San Francisco, California, New York, New
York, Cambridge, Massachusetts,  Sydney, Australia and Melbourne, Australia. Our
telesales  organization is primarily focused on selling our products to existing
Axys clients and small and mid-sized investment  management  organizations.  Our
telesales  representatives  are located in San  Francisco,  California,  and New
York, New York. Our sales force is supported by extensive,  ongoing  product and
sales training.

   Marketing

  Our marketing  department is responsible for assessing  market  opportunities,
product  planning and management and specific sales support.  In addition to its
traditional marketing functions, our marketing organization is actively involved
in a process  called "Market  Validation."  Market  Validation  uses a system of
interaction  with  and  input  from  potential  and  existing  clients,  product
development,  sales and client  services and support  departments  to define the
scope,  features and  functionality  of new products  and product  upgrades.  In
addition,  our product managers are responsible for all phases of a product life
cycle from product  development  through product  introduction  and beyond.  Our
marketing  department is also  responsible  for corporate  marketing,  including
generating client leads, targeted direct mail campaigns, seminars,  advertising,
trade shows and conferences and public  relations  efforts and also provides the
sales force with appropriate written and electronic  materials to use during the
sales process.
<PAGE>
Product Development

  In recent  years,  we have  substantially  increased  our product  development
expenditures  in order to  accelerate  the  rate of new  product  introductions,
incorporate new technologies  and sustain the quality of our products.  In 2000,
1999, and 1998, our product  development  expenditures were approximately  $21.6
million, $16.8 million, and $12.6 million, respectively. Our product development
activities include the  identification and validation of product  specifications
as well as engineering, quality assurance and documentation.

  Our new products and product  upgrades  require varying degrees of development
time,  depending  upon  the  complexity  of  the  accounting   requirements  and
securities regulations which they are intended to address, as well as the number
and type of features  incorporated.  To date, we have primarily  relied upon the
internal  development  of our products.  We have in the past  acquired,  and may
again in the future  acquire,  additional  technologies  or products  from third
parties.   We  intend  to  continue  to  support  industry  standard   operating
environments, client/server architectures and network protocols.

Competition

  The market for  investment  management  software is  segmented by the relative
size of the organizations that manage investment portfolios.  The market in each
segment is intensely competitive and highly fragmented,  subject to rapid change
and highly  sensitive  to new product  introductions  and  marketing  efforts by
industry participants. Our competitors include providers of software and related
services as well as providers of timeshare  services.  Competitors vary in size,
scope of services  offered and  platforms  supported.  In  addition,  we compete
indirectly with existing and potential  clients,  many of whom develop their own
software for their  particular  needs and  therefore may be reluctant to license
software products offered by independent vendors such as Advent. With respect to
the market for our portfolio accounting products, we currently compete primarily
with  Financial  Models  Company,  Inc.,  Shaw Data,  a division of SunGard Data
Systems,  Inc., Thomson Financial,  a division of The Thomson  Corporation,  and
with a  number  of other  smaller  companies.  We  believe  that  the  principal
competitive  factors  affecting  our  market  include  product  performance  and
functionality,  ease of use,  scalability,  ability to integrate  external  data
sources,  product and company reputation,  client service and support and price.
We may not compete  successfully  against  current and future  competitors,  and
competitive  pressures  could  result  in price  reductions,  reduced  operating
margins or the loss of market share.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights

  Our success is  dependent  in part on our  ability to protect our  proprietary
technology.  We rely on a combination  of copyright and  trademark  laws,  trade
secrets,  software  security  measures,  confidentiality  agreements and license
agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights and our software.  We
have  registered  trademarks  for many of our  products  and  services  and will
continue to evaluate the  registration of additional  trademarks as appropriate.
We generally enter into  confidentiality  agreements with our employees and with
our  resellers and  customers.  Despite  these  efforts,  it may be possible for
unauthorized  third  parties to copy  certain  portions  of our  products  or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information.  We do
not  have  any  patents,   and  existing  copyright  laws  afford  only  limited
protection.  In  addition,  we cannot be certain  that  others  will not develop
substantially   equivalent  or  superseding  proprietary  technology,   or  that
equivalent  products  will not be marketed  in  competition  with our  products,
thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. Furthermore,
confidentiality   agreements  between  us  and  our  employees  or  any  license
agreements  with  our  clients  may not  provide  meaningful  protection  of our
proprietary  information in the event of any  unauthorized  use or disclosure of
it. In addition,  the laws of certain  countries do not protect our  proprietary
rights to the same extent, as do the laws of the United States.  Accordingly, we
may not be able to protect  our  proprietary  software  in the United  States or
abroad   against   unauthorized   third  party  copying  or  use,   which  could
significantly harm our business.

Employees

  As of March 1, 2001, we had approximately  employees 701 on a full-time basis,
including in 94 sales,  123 in professional  services,  41 in marketing,  206 in
product  development,  130 in client  services  and  support and 107 in finance,
administration,  operations and general management.  We believe that we maintain
competitive  compensation,  benefits,  equity participation and work environment
policies to assist in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  Our success
depends to a significant  extent upon the continued  contributions of its senior
management and other key  personnel,  many of who would be difficult to replace.
The loss of the service of one or more senior  managers or other employees could
have a  material  adverse  effect  upon  our  business,  operating  results  and
financial condition.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We
have not  experienced  any work stoppages and we believe our employee  relations
are good.
<PAGE>
Item 2. PROPERTIES

  Our principal executive offices are located in San Francisco, California where
we lease  approximately  59,000  square feet under a lease that  expires in 2008
with a five-year  extension  option;  approximately  32,000  square feet under a
lease that  expires in 2004 with a  five-year  extension  option;  approximately
18,400 square feet under a lease that expires in 2005 with a five-year extension
option; and approximately  60,000 square feet under a lease that expires in 2011
with two consecutive  five-year extension options. We lease two separate offices
in New York; approximately 30,100 square feet under a lease that expires in 2010
with a five-year  extension option and approximately  29,000 square feet under a
lease that  expires in 2008 with a  five-year  extension  option.  We also lease
space (typically less than 10,000 square feet) in various  geographic  locations
in New  Jersey,  Massachusetts,  Melbourne,  Australia,  and  Sydney,  Australia
primarily for sales and support personnel.  We believe that these facilities are
adequate for our  near-term  needs and that suitable  additional or  alternative
space will be available as needed.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

  From time to time we are involved in  litigation  incidental to the conduct of
our  business.  We are not  party to any  lawsuit  or  proceeding  that,  in our
opinion, is likely to seriously harm our business.

Item 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS

    None.

                                     PART I

                                     PART II

  With the exception of the  information  incorporated  by reference to the 2000
Annual Report to Stockholders in Part II of this Form 10-K, Advent's 2000 Annual
Report to Stockholders is not deemed to be filed as part of this Form 10-K.

Item 5.  MARKET FOR COMPANY'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

  Advent had  approximately 67 stockholders of record at March 8, 2001.  Because
many of our shares of Common Stock are held by brokers and other institutions on
behalf  of  stockholders,  we  are  unable  to  estimate  the  total  number  of
stockholders  represented by these record holders. Other information required by
this Item is  incorporated  by  reference  to the  sections  entitled  "Selected
Financial Data - Price Range of Common Stock" and "Corporate Information - Stock
Information" in Advent's 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders.

Item 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

  Other  information  required by this Item is  incorporated by reference to the
sections entitled "Selected Financial Data - Selected Annual Data" and "Selected
Financial  Data - Selected  Quarterly  Data" in Advent's  2000 Annual  Report to
Stockholders.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

  The  information  required by this Item is  incorporated  by  reference to the
section entitled  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition
and Results of Operations" in Advent's 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders.

Risk Factors

Our Operating Results Fluctuate Significantly And We May Not Be Able To Maintain
Our Existing Growth Rates.

  Licenses  into  multi-user  networked  environments  have  increased  both  in
individual  size and  number,  and the  timing  and size of  individual  license
transactions are becoming increasingly  important factors in quarterly operating
results.  The sales cycles for  transactions  of this size are often lengthy and
unpredictable.  We may not be successful  in closing large license  transactions
such as these on a timely basis or at all.  Accordingly,  because  revenues from
large site licenses are increasing as a portion of our net revenues,  the timing
of such licenses could cause additional  variability in our quarterly  operating
results.  We typically  ship our software  products  shortly  after receipt of a
signed license agreement and initial payment and, consequently, software product
backlog  at the  beginning  of any  quarter  typically  represents  only a small
portion of that  quarter's  expected  revenues.  Our expense levels are based in
significant  part on our  expectations  of future  revenues  and  therefore  are
relatively  fixed in the short term.  Due to the fixed nature of these  expenses
combined with the relatively  high gross margin  historically  achieved by us on
products  and  services,  an  unanticipated  decline  in  net  revenues  in  any
particular  quarter  is  likely  to  disproportionately   adversely  affect  our
operating results.

  We have  generally  realized  lower  revenues  from  license fees in the first
quarter of the year than in the last quarter of the prior year.  We believe that
this has been due  primarily  to the  concentration  by some  clients  of larger
capital  purchases in the fourth  quarter of the  calendar  year and their lower
purchasing  activity during the subsequent first quarter.  We believe our annual
incentive  compensation  plans,  which tend to produce increased  year-end sales
activity,  compound  this  factor.  Furthermore,  we  have  often  recognized  a
substantial  portion of each quarter's license revenues in the last month, weeks
or  even  days  of  that  quarter.  As a  result,  the  magnitude  of  quarterly
fluctuations  in revenue or earnings  may not be evident  until late in or after
the close of a particular quarter.

  Because of the above factors, we believe that period-to-period  comparisons of
our operating results are not necessarily  meaningful and that these comparisons
cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.

  Our stock price has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering
in November 1995.  Like many  companies in the  technology  and emerging  growth
sector, our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations, particularly during
times of high market volatility. If net revenues or earnings in any quarter fail
to meet the investment  community's  expectations,  our stock price is likely to
decline.  In addition,  our stock price may be affected by broader market trends
unrelated to our performance.

Our Sales Cycle is Long and We Have  Limited  Ability to Forecast the Timing and
Amount of Specific Sales.

  Because the  purchase of our software  products  often  requires  significant,
executive-level  investment  and systems  architecture  decisions by prospective
customers,  we must generally engage in a relatively lengthy sales effort. These
transactions  may be delayed during the customer  acceptance  process because we
must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding
the use and benefit of our  products.  As a result,  the sales cycle  associated
with the purchase of our software  products is typically  between two and twelve
months  depending  upon the size of the  client,  though it can be  considerably
longer,  and is  subject  to a number of  significant  risks  over which we have
little or no control,  including customers'  budgeting  constraints and internal
acceptance  procedures.  As a result of a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle,
we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales. The
timing of large  individual  sales is  especially  difficult to  forecast.  As a
result,  there can be no assurance  that we will be  successful in closing large
license  transactions  on a timely  basis or at all.  Because our  expenses  are
generally  relatively  fixed in the near term,  any shortfall  from  anticipated
revenues  could result in significant  variations in our operating  results from
quarter to quarter.

  The  implementation  of our  solutions  involves a  significant  commitment of
resources by customers and by us over an extended period of time. Also, the size
and complexity of any particular  implementation project can cause delays in the
sales cycle that precedes it. Any such delays could seriously harm our business.

We Depend Heavily On Our Product, Axys.

  In 2000, 1999 and 1998, we derived a substantial  majority of our net revenues
from the licensing of Axys and related products and services. In addition,  many
of our other  products,  such as Moxy,  Qube and various  data  interfaces  were
designed to operate with Axys to provide an integrated solution. As a result, we
believe that a majority of our net revenues,  for the foreseeable  future,  will
depend upon continued  market  acceptance of Axys,  enhancements  or upgrades to
Axys and related products and services.

We Are Continuing to Expand Our Internet Initiative.

  To take  advantage of the  Internet,  we are  continuing to expand an Internet
Initiative  under  which  we  are  developing   services,   both  announced  and
unannounced, to bring Internet-based products and services to clients. The first
of these  services,  Rex, was launched  during the second  quarter of 1997.  The
second service,  Advent Browser Reporting,  was launched in the third quarter of
1998.  During 2000 we announced a number of new products and services which take
advantage of Internet  technology,  including Advent  TrustedNetwork,  MyAdvent,
eActions(TM) (through our Hub Data subsidiary), Internet-enabled enhancements to
Gifts for Windows  (through our MicroEdge  subsidiary) and Advent  Outsource,  a
service that delivers  Advent Office  functionality  through an ASP model. As we
develop new  products and services  under our Internet  Initiative,  we have and
will continue to enter into development  agreements with information  providers,
clients or other  companies in order to accelerate  the delivery of new products
and services.  We may not be successful in marketing our Internet services or in
developing  other Internet  services.  Our failure to do so could seriously harm
our  business.  In  addition,  we  cannot  assure  you  that  there  will not be
disruptions in Internet  services  beyond our control or that of our third party
vendors. Any such disruptions could harm our business.
<PAGE>
Security Risks and Concerns May Deter the Use of the Internet for Conducting
Electronic Commerce.

  A significant  barrier to electronic commerce and communications is the secure
transmission  of  confidential  information  over public  networks.  Advances in
computer  capabilities,  new  discoveries in the field of  cryptography or other
events or  developments  could result in compromises or breaches of our security
systems or those of other web sites to protect proprietary  information.  If any
well-publicized  compromises of security were to occur, it could have the effect
of   substantially   reducing   the  use  of  the   Internet  for  commerce  and
communications.   Anyone   who   circumvents   our   security   measures   could
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or
operations. The Internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network
from many sources. In the past, computer viruses, software programs that disable
or impair  computers,  have been  distributed  and have rapidly  spread over the
Internet.  Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our
customers or other third parties, which could disrupt or make it inaccessible to
customers.  We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources
to protect  against the threat of security  breaches  or to  alleviate  problems
caused by breaches.  To the extent that our  activities  may involve the storage
and transmission of proprietary  information,  security breaches could expose us
to a risk of loss or litigation and possible  liability.  Our security  measures
may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business would be harmed
if we do not prevent them

We Face Risks Related to Our New Business Areas.

  We have  expanded in recent  periods  into a number of new  business  areas to
foster long-term growth including international operations,  strategic alliances
and our  Internet  Initiative.  These  areas are  relatively  new to our product
development  and  sales  personnel.   New  business  areas  require  significant
management time and resources prior to generating  significant  revenues and may
divert  management  from our core  business.  There is no assurance that we will
compete  effectively or will generate  significant  revenues in these areas. The
success of our  Internet  Initiative,  in  particular,  is  difficult to predict
because  it  represents  a  new  area  of  business  for  our  entire  industry.
Additionally, to help manage our growth, we will need to continually improve our
operational, financial, management and information systems and controls.

We Expect Our Gross and Operating Margins May Fluctuate Over Time.

  We also expect that our gross and operating  margins may fluctuate from period
to period as we continue to introduce new recurring revenue products, expand our
professional  services  organization  and associated  revenue,  continue to hire
additional  personnel and increase  other  expenses to support our business.  We
plan our expense levels based primarily on forecasted  revenue  levels.  Because
these expenses are relatively  fixed in the short term, a fluctuation in revenue
could lead to operating results differing from expectations.

We Must Continue to Introduce New Products and Product Enhancements.

  The market for our products is  characterized by rapid  technological  change,
changes in customer demands and evolving industry  standards.  As a result,  our
future  success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products
or product  enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and
to respond to these changing  standards and practices.  We may not be successful
in developing, introducing and marketing new products or product enhancements on
a timely and cost effective  basis,  or at all, and our new products and product
enhancements  may not adequately  meet the  requirements  of the  marketplace or
achieve market acceptance. Delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of
new products or enhancements may result in client  dissatisfaction  and delay or
loss of product revenues.  If we are unable, for technological or other reasons,
to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing  products in a
timely manner in response to changing market conditions or client  requirements,
or if new  products or new versions of existing  products do not achieve  market
acceptance,  our business would be seriously harmed. In addition, our ability to
develop new products and product  enhancements is dependent upon the products of
other software  vendors,  including  certain system  software  vendors,  such as
Microsoft  Corporation,  database vendors and development  tool vendors.  If the
products of such vendors have design  defects or flaws,  or if such products are
unexpectedly  delayed in their  introduction,  our  business  could be seriously
harmed.  Software  products  as  complex  as  those  offered  by us may  contain
undetected  defects  or errors  when first  introduced  or as new  versions  are
released.  Although we have not experienced  adverse effects  resulting from any
software  errors,  we cannot  assure  you that,  despite  testing  by us and our
clients,  defects or errors will not be found in new products after commencement
of  commercial  shipments,  resulting in loss of or delay in market  acceptance,
which could seriously harm our business.
<PAGE>
We Depend Upon Financial Markets.

  The target  clients for our  products  include a range of  organizations  that
manage investment  portfolios,  including investment advisors,  brokerage firms,
banks and hedge  funds.  In  addition,  we target  corporations,  public  funds,
universities  and  non-profit   organizations,   which  also  manage  investment
portfolios  and have many of the same needs.  The success of many of our clients
is intrinsically  linked to the health of the financial markets. We believe that
demand for our products could be  disproportionately  affected by  fluctuations,
disruptions,  instability or downturns in the financial  markets which may cause
clients and  potential  clients to exit the industry or delay,  cancel or reduce
any  planned  expenditures  for  investment   management  systems  and  software
products. Any resulting decline in demand for our products could have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

General Economic Conditions May Reduce Our Revenues.

  We believe  that the  market  for large  management  software  systems  may be
negatively impacted by a number of factors, including:

o reductions in capital expenditures by large customers;

o poor performance of major financial markets; and

o increasing competition.

The above factors may, in turn,  give rise to a number of market trends that may
slow revenue growth across the industry, including:

o longer sales cycles;

o deferral or delay of information technology projects and generally reduced
  expenditures for software and related services; and

o increased price competition.

  Although we do not believe  these  factors have impacted our revenues to date,
if the current economic slowdown  continues the presence of these factors in the
market for large management software systems could adversely affect our business
and results of operations.

If Our Relationship With Interactive Data is Terminated, Our Business May Be
Harmed.

  Many of our clients use our proprietary  interface to electronically  retrieve
pricing  and  other  data  from  Interactive  Data.  Interactive  Data pays us a
commission based on their revenues from providing this data to our clients.  Our
software  products have been  customized to be compatible  with their system and
this software would need to be redesigned if their services were unavailable for
any reason.  Termination of our agreement with Interactive Data would require at
least two years notice by either us or them,  or 90 days in the case of material
breach.  If our  relationship  with  Interactive  Data were  terminated or their
services  were  unavailable  to our  clients  for any  reason,  replacing  these
services could be costly and time consuming.

We Face Intense Competition.

  The market for investment  management  software is intensely  competitive  and
highly  fragmented,  subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product
introductions  and marketing efforts by industry  participants.  Our competitors
include  providers  of software  and related  services as well as  providers  of
timeshare services.

  Our  competitors  vary in  size,  scope  of  services  offered  and  platforms
supported.  In addition,  we compete  indirectly  with  existing  and  potential
clients,  many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and
therefore may be reluctant to license  software  products offered by independent
vendors like us. Many of our  competitors  have longer  operating  histories and
greater  financial,  technical,  sales and  marketing  resources  than we do. We
cannot  guarantee that we will be able to compete  successfully  against current
and future  competitors or that  competitive  pressures will not result in price
reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of which
could seriously harm our business.

We Face Challenges in Expanding Our International Operations.

  We market and sell our products in the United States and, to a lesser  extent,
internationally. We have established a subsidiary located in Australia to market
and  license  our  products  in  Australia.  In  addition,  we  entered  into  a
distributor  relationship in 1999 with Advent Europe, an independent distributor
of our products in selected  European  markets.  In order to further  expand our
international  operations,  we would need to  continue to  establish  additional
facilities,  acquire  other  businesses  or enter into  additional  distribution
relationships  in other  parts  of the  world.  The  expansion  of our  existing
international  operations and entry into additional  international  markets will
require significant  management attention and financial resources.  We cannot be
certain that our investments in establishing  facilities in other countries will
produce  desired  levels of revenue.  We currently  have limited  experience  in
developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our
products internationally.  In addition,  international operations are subject to
other inherent risks, including:

o The impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;

o Greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection
  periods;

o Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

o Difficulties in successfully adapting our products to the language, regulatory
  and technology standards of other countries;

o Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;

o Reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

o Potentially adverse tax consequences; and

o Political and economic instability.

     Our international  revenues are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, with
the  exception  of  our  subsidiary,   Advent  Australia  Pty.,  Ltd.   ("Advent
Australia").  The revenues,  expenses, assets and liabilities of our subsidiary,
Advent Australia,  are primarily  denominated in Australian dollars. We have not
historically undertaken foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover potential
foreign currency  exposure.  Future  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may
adversely affect revenues from international  sales and the U.S. dollar value of
Advent  Australia's  revenues,  expenses,  assets  and  liabilities.  Undetected
Software Errors or Failures Found in New Products May Result in Loss of or Delay
in Market Acceptance of Our Products That Could Seriously Harm Our Business.

  Our products may contain  undetected  software  errors or failures  when first
introduced or as new versions are released. Despite testing by us and by current
and  potential  customers,  errors may not be found in new products  until after
commencement of commercial shipments,  resulting in loss of or a delay in market
acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

If We Are  Unable to  Protect  Our  Intellectual  Property  We May Be Subject to
Increased Competition That Could Seriously Harm Our Business.

  Our  success  depends  significantly  upon  our  proprietary  technology.   We
currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws,  trade secrets,
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary
rights. We have registered  trademarks for many of our products and services and
will  continue  to  evaluate  the  registration  of  additional   trademarks  as
appropriate.  We  generally  enter  into  confidentiality  agreements  with  our
employees and with our resellers and customers. We seek to protect our software,
documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws,
which afford only limited protection.  Despite these efforts, it may be possible
for  unauthorized  third parties to copy certain  portions of our products or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information.  We do
not  have  any  patents,   and  existing  copyright  laws  afford  only  limited
protection.  In  addition,  we cannot be certain  that  others  will not develop
substantially   equivalent  or  superseding  proprietary  technology,   or  that
equivalent  products  will not be marketed  in  competition  with our  products,
thereby  substantially  reducing the value of our proprietary  rights. We cannot
assure you that we will develop  proprietary  products or technologies  that are
patentable,  that any patent,  if issued,  would provide us with any competitive
advantages or would not be challenged by third  parties,  or that the patents of
others will not adversely affect our ability to do business.

  Litigation  may be  necessary  to protect  our  proprietary  technology.  This
litigation may be time-consuming  and expensive.  Despite our efforts to protect
our proprietary rights,  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our
products  or to obtain and use  information  that we regard as  proprietary.  In
addition,  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect  proprietary rights
to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States.  We cannot assure you
that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our
competitors will not  independently  develop similar  technology,  duplicate our
products  or  design  around  any  patent  that  may be  issued  to us or  other
intellectual property rights of ours.

We Face Risks Associated with Potential Acquisitions or Divestitures.

  We may acquire or make  investments in  complementary  companies,  products or
technologies.  In addition,  we continually  evaluate the performance of all our
products  and  product  lines and may sell or  discontinue  current  products or
product lines. If we buy a company, we could have difficulty in integrating that
company's  personnel  and  operations.  In  addition,  the key  personnel of the
acquired  company  may  decide  not to work for us.  If we make  other  types of
acquisitions,  we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired  technology
or products into our operations.  These  difficulties  could disrupt our ongoing
business,  distract our  management  and  employees  and increase our  expenses.
Furthermore,  we may have to incur debt, write-off software development costs or
other assets, incur severance liabilities, amortize expenses related to goodwill
and other  intangible  assets or issue equity  securities  to pay for any future
acquisitions.  The  issuance  of equity  securities  could  dilute our  existing
stockholders' ownership.

  In  addition,  potential  acquisition  candidates  targeted by us may not have
audited financial  statements,  detailed financial  information or any degree of
internal  controls.  There can be no assurance  that an audit  subsequent to any
successful completion of an acquisition will not reveal matters of significance,
including  issues  regarding  revenues,  expenses,  liabilities,  contingent  or
otherwise, technology, products, services or intellectual property. There can be
no  assurance  that we would be  successful  in  overcoming  these or any  other
significant  risks  encountered  and the  failure to do so could have a material
adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.

We Must Retain Key Employees and Recruit Qualified Technical and Sales
Personnel.

  We believe that our success  will depend on the  continued  employment  of our
senior management and key technical  personnel,  (none of whom has an employment
agreement with us). Additionally, our continued success depends, in part, on our
ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified technical, and sales
and other  personnel.  Because our future success is dependent on our ability to
continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are particularly dependent on
our ability to identify,  attract,  motivate and retain qualified engineers with
the requisite education,  backgrounds and industry  experience.  Competition for
qualified  engineers,  particularly in Northern California and the San Francisco
Bay Area, is intense.  The loss of the services of a  significant  number of our
engineers or sales  people could be  disruptive  to our  development  efforts or
business relationships and could seriously harm our business.

Business Interruptions Could Adversely Affect Our Business.

    Our operations are vulnerable to  interruption  by fire,  earthquake,  power
loss,  telecommunications  failure  and other  events  beyond our  control.  Our
facilities in  California  are  currently  subject to electrical  blackouts as a
consequence of a shortage of available  electrical power.  Although we do have a
backup  generator,  which we  would  be able to  utilize  to  maintain  critical
functionalities,  in the event these blackouts continue or increase in severity,
they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities. In connection with
the shortage of available power, prices for electricity have risen dramatically,
and will likely  continue to increase  for the  foreseeable  future.  Such price
changes  will  increase  our  operating  costs,  which  could  in turn  hurt our
profitability.

Item 7a.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

  We are  exposed  to  financial  market  risks,  including  changes  in foreign
currency  exchange  rates and  interest  rates.  Much of our revenue and capital
spending is transacted in U.S. dollars.  However,  since the formation of Advent
Australia  whose  revenues and capital  spending are  transacted  in  Australian
dollars we have greater  exposure to foreign currency  fluctuations.  Results of
operations  from Advent  Australia  are not material to our  operating  results;
therefore, we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially
adversely affect our overall financial  position,  results of operations or cash
flows.  We believe  that the fair value of our  investment  portfolio or related
income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest
rates due mainly to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio.  However,
immediate sharp increases in interest rates could have a material adverse affect
on the fair  value of our  investment  portfolio.  Conversely,  immediate  sharp
declines  in  interest  rates  could  seriously  harm  interest  earnings of our
investment portfolio.

dollars) and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our
investment portfolio.

also  included  an audit of the  financial  statement  schedule  listed  in Item

<DESCRIPTION>SELECTED PORTIONS OF ADVENT'S 2000 ANNUAL REPORT
<TEXT>





                                                                    EXHIBIT 13.1

        SELECTED PORTIONS OF ADVENT'S 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

    We are the  leading  provider  of  stand-alone  and  client/server  software
products,  data  interfaces and related  maintenance and services that automate,
integrate  and  support  mission-critical  functions  of  investment  management
organizations.   Our  clients  vary  significantly  in  size  and  assets  under
management and include investment advisors, brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds,
corporations, public funds, universities and non-profit organizations.

Acquisitions

     In February  1998, we issued 750,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for
all of the  outstanding  shares of  MicroEdge,  a leading  provider  of software
products to foundations,  corporations  and other  organizations to manage their
grant-making  activities.  This  business  combination  was  accounted  for as a
pooling of interests  and the results of operations of MicroEdge are included in
the financial statements beginning January 1, 1998. The results of operations as
well as the  assets and  liabilities  of  MicroEdge  in prior  periods  were not
material  to the  consolidated  results of  operations  or  financial  position.
Accordingly,  we did not restate our financial  statements  for periods prior to
January 1, 1998.

     In May 1998, we issued 510,000 shares of Common Stock for certain assets of
the Grants  Management  Division of  Blackbaud,  Inc., a privately  held company
located in Charleston,  South Carolina. Through this acquisition we combined the
Grants Management product line of Blackbaud with MicroEdge. This transaction was
accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  of the business and
assets  acquired  are  included  in our  financial  statements  from the date of
acquisition.   We  incurred  a  charge  relating  to  in-process   research  and
development  and  other  expenses  of  $5.4  million  in  connection  with  this
transaction.   We  believe  that  the   technology   acquired  had  not  reached
technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use. Other intangibles
of $2.0 million were recorded in connection with this  acquisition and are being
amortized over a period of 5 years.

     In November  1998,  we issued  45,000  shares of Common Stock and paid $4.1
million  in  exchange  for all the  outstanding  shares  of Hub  Data,  Inc.,  a
distributor  of  consolidated  securities  information  and  data to  investment
management  organizations.  Hub Data is located in Cambridge,  Massachusetts and
delivers  services to over 240  institutional  investment  firms.  This business
combination  was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of operations  for
Hub Data are included in our financial  statements  beginning on the acquisition
date. We incurred a charge  relating to in-process  research and  development of
$3.0 million in connection with this transaction. We believe that the technology
acquired had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. As a result of net  liabilities  assumed and  acquisition  expenses of $1.6
million,  goodwill  of  $3.2  million  was  recorded  in  connection  with  this
transaction and is being amortized over a 7 year period.

      In November  1998,  we paid AUS  $583,000  (approximately  US $370,000) in
exchange for all the outstanding shares of Portfolio  Management  Systems,  Pty.
Ltd., a distributor of Advent products in Australia.  This business  combination
was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  are included in
our financial  statements  beginning on the acquisition  date. This  acquisition
provides an  international  channel for sale of our products and services.  As a
result of net  liabilities  assumed and  acquisition  expenses of $2.0  million,
goodwill of $2.4 million was recorded in connection with this transaction and is
being amortized over a period of 43 months.  Subsequent to the  acquisition,  we
changed the name of this subsidiary to Advent Australia.

Distributor Relationship

    We rely on a  number  of  strategic  alliances  to  help us  achieve  market
acceptance of our products and to leverage our development, sales, and marketing
resources. In the third quarter of 1999, our existing distributor in Scandinavia
formed Advent Europe to distribute the Advent Office suite in selected  European
markets.  Advent  Europe,  incorporated  in The  Netherlands,  is an independent
entity and is financially backed by our Scandinavian  distributor.  It makes tax
and  language  modifications  to Advent  Office to fit the various  needs of the
local  jurisdictions  and then markets and licenses the Advent Office suite. All
transactions  between  Advent  Europe  and us are  transacted  in U.S.  dollars.
Revenue  from sales to this  distributor  are  recognized  when the  distributor
submits a signed  contract that the product has been sold to its  customer,  the
product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility
is probable.

Secondary Offering

    In June 1999, we completed a secondary public offering of 3.9 million shares
of Common  Stock at an offering  price of $20.688 per share.  Of the 3.9 million
shares  of  Common  Stock  offered,  300,000  shares  were  sold  by  a  selling
stockholder. The net proceeds of the offering to Advent were $70.2 million.

Stock Splits

    Our Board of Directors approved a three-for-two split of our Common Stock in
July 1999.  The stock split was effected as a stock  dividend.  Stockholders  of
record as of the close of business  on July 30,  1999 were issued a  certificate
representing  one  additional  Common Share for every two shares of Common Stock
held on the record date. These certificates were distributed on August 16, 1999.
This stock split increased the number of shares  outstanding from  approximately
9.6 million shares to approximately 14.4 million shares.

      Our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our Common Stock in
February 2000. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend. Stockholders of
record  as of the  close  of  business  on  February  28,  2000  were  issued  a
certificate  representing  one additional  Common Share for each share of Common
Stock held on the record date. These  certificates were distributed on March 13,
2000.  This  stock  split  increased  the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock
outstanding from approximately 14.8 million shares to approximately 29.6 million
shares.

Results of Operations For The Years Ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998

Revenues

     Net revenues were $134.9 million, $101.6 million and $71.0 million in 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively, representing increases of 33% from 1999 to 2000 and
43% from 1998 to 1999. Our net revenues are derived from license and development
fees,  maintenance and other recurring revenues,  and professional  services and
other revenues related to our software products. In each of 2000, 1999 and 1998,
the majority of our net revenues were from domestic  sales,  with  international
sales  representing  less than 8% of net revenues.  License revenues are derived
from the licensing of software  products while development fees are derived from
development contracts that we have entered into with other companies,  including
customers and development partners. Maintenance and other recurring revenues are
derived from maintenance fees charged in the initial licensing year, renewals of
annual  maintenance  services in subsequent years and recurring revenues derived
from  our  subscription-based  and  transaction-based   services.   Professional
services and other  revenues  include fees for  consulting,  implementation  and
integration management, custom report writing, training services and semi-annual
conferences.

     Axys and its related  products and services  accounted  for the majority of
net  revenues  in 2000,  1999 and  1998.  However,  we have been  successful  in
increasing  multi-product  sales  by  emphasizing  our  suite of  products  and,
therefore, new products have accounted for an increasing portion of net revenues
in all three years.

     Each  of  the  major  revenue  categories  has  historically  varied  as  a
percentage of net revenues and we expect this  variability to continue in future
periods.  This variability is partially due to the timing of the introduction of
new products,  the relative size and timing of individual  licenses,  as well as
the  complexity  of  the  implementation,   the  resulting   proportion  of  the
maintenance and professional  services components of these license  transactions
and the amount of client use of pricing and related data.

     License and Development  Fees.  License and  development  fees revenue were
$66.1  million,  $49.3  million  and  $36.6  million  in 2000,  1999  and  1998,
respectively,  representing increases of 34% from 1999 to 2000 and 35% from 1998
to 1999.  License and development  fees revenues as a percentage of net revenues
were 49%, 49% and 52% in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively.  The  increases in
license revenue, in absolute dollars, were primarily due to increased demand for
the Advent Office suite and increased  demand for our Geneva  software  which is
sold primarily to global financial  institutions,  partially offset by decreased
development fees from certain  development  partners.  We typically  license our
products on a per server,  per user basis with the price per site varying  based
on the selection of the products licensed and the number of authorized users. As
we carry out larger implementations and continue our Internet Initiative, we may
enter into further development contracts through which we earn development fees.
License revenues also increased due to follow-on sales to existing customers and
an increase of  multi-product  transactions.  We expect  these  transactions  to
continue to represent a significant proportion of revenues.

     Maintenance and Other Recurring.  Maintenance and other recurring  revenues
were $50.1  million,  $38.2  million and $25.5  million in 2000,  1999 and 1998,
respectively,  representing increases of 31% from 1999 to 2000 and 50% from 1998
to 1999.  Maintenance  and other  recurring  revenues,  as a  percentage  of net
revenues, were 37%, 38% and 36% in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The growth
in maintenance and other recurring revenues, in absolute dollars, in all periods
was primarily due to a larger customer base and higher average maintenance fees.
Higher  average  maintenance  fees are primarily due to clients  selecting  more
components for a full feature,  multi-product solution and clients expanding the
number of users and sites licensing our software. In addition,  increased demand
for implementation management support contributed to the increase in maintenance
and other recurring revenues.  The acquisitions we made in 1998 also contributed
to the growth in maintenance and other recurring revenues during 1999.

     Professional  Services and Other.  Professional services and other revenues
were $18.7  million,  $14.1  million  and $8.9  million in 2000,  1999 and 1998,
respectively,  representing increases of 33% from 1999 to 2000 and 58% from 1998
to 1999.  Professional  services  and other  revenues,  as a  percentage  of net
revenues,  were 14%,  14% and 12% in 2000,  1999,  and 1998,  respectively.  The
increases in  professional  services and other  revenue  were  primarily  due to
higher  consulting  fees from  increasingly  complex  implementations  at larger
financial   institutions  and  increased  revenues  from  our  semi-annual  user
conferences. Professional services and other revenues also increased in 1999 due
to the acquisitions we made in 1998.

Cost of Revenues

     Cost of License and Development  Fees. Cost of license and development fees
revenues  were $5.3  million,  $3.6 million and $2.9  million in 2000,  1999 and
1998,  respectively,  representing 8%, 7% and 8% of license and development fees
revenues in these periods,  respectively.  Cost of license and development  fees
revenue  consists  primarily  of the  cost of  product  media  and  duplication,
manuals,  packaging  materials,  the direct  labor  involved  in  producing  and
distributing  our software as well as royalties paid to third  parties.  Cost of
license and  development  fees will fluctuate  between periods due to the mix of
license and development fee revenues.  The increase, in absolute dollars, in all
years  is  primarily  related  to  increased  revenues.   Cost  of  license  and
development fees as a percentage of related  revenues was relatively  consistent
between 1998 and 2000.

     Cost of Maintenance  and Other  Recurring.  Cost of  maintenance  and other
recurring  revenues were $13.5 million,  $10.4 million and $6.3 million in 2000,
1999 and 1998,  respectively,  representing  27%, 27% and 25% of maintenance and
other  recurring  revenues  in these  periods,  respectively.  These  costs  are
primarily comprised of the direct costs of providing technical support and other
services for recurring  revenues,  the engineering costs associated with product
updates   and   royalties   paid   to   third   party   subscription-based   and
transaction-based  vendors.  These expenses,  in absolute dollars,  increased in
each year due to increased  staffing  required to support a larger customer base
and more complex  implementations  as well as increased  royalties paid to third
party subscription-based and transaction-based  vendors. Cost of maintenance and
other recurring revenues as a percentage of related revenues increased primarily
due to higher personnel related costs for technical support and costs associated
with the  introduction  and  adoption  of new  recurring  revenue  products  and
services.

     Cost of Professional  Services and Other. Cost of professional services and
other  revenues were $6.1 million,  $5.3 million and $3.9 million in 2000,  1999
and 1998,  respectively,  representing 33%, 38% and 44% of professional services
and other revenues in these periods, respectively. These costs consist primarily
of  personnel  related  costs  associated  with the client  services and support
organization in providing consulting, custom report writing, conversions of data
from clients' previous systems,  and cost of hosting our client conferences.  To
the  extent  that such  personnel  are not fully used in  consulting,  training,
conversion or custom report  writing  projects,  they are allocated to presales,
marketing and  engineering  activities  and the  resultant  costs are charged to
operating  expenses.  Cost of  professional  services  and  other,  in  absolute
dollars,  increased year to year due to increases in personnel and related costs
necessary  to  provide   services  to  an  expanded   installed  base.  Cost  of
professional  services as a percentage of related revenues  decreased  primarily
due to higher  utilization of personnel and economies of scale  associated  with
absorbing fixed costs over a larger revenue base.

Operating Expenses

     Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses were $42.6 million, $32.2
million and $23.5  million in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively,  representing
increases  of 32%  from  1999 to 2000  and 37%  from  1998 to  1999.  Sales  and
marketing  expenses,  as a  percentage  of  net  revenues,  remained  relatively
consistent at 32%, 32% and 33% in 2000, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Sales and
marketing  expenses consist primarily of the costs of personnel  involved in the
sales and marketing  process,  sales  commissions,  advertising  and promotional
materials,  sales facilities expense,  trade shows, and seminars. The increases,
in absolute dollars, were due to a continued increase in the number of sales and
marketing  personnel and increased  marketing  efforts towards the Advent Office
suite and our Internet  Initiative.  In 2000, sales and marketing  expenses also
increased  due to moving our New York City sales office to a larger  facility in
April 2000.

     Product Development. Product development expenses were $21.6 million, $16.8
million and $12.6  million in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively,  representing
increases  of 29%  from  1999  to 2000  and  33%  from  1998  to  1999.  Product
development expenses, as a percentage of net revenues,  were 16%, 17% and 18% in
2000, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Product development expenses increased,  in
absolute dollars,  primarily due to an increase in the number of personnel as we
increased  our product  development  efforts to  accelerate  the rate of product
enhancements  and  new  product   introductions.   We  anticipate  that  product
development  expenses  will continue to increase in absolute  dollars,  although
such expenses may vary as a percentage of net revenues.

     General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses were $12.0
million,  $9.9  million and $7.5 million in 2000,  1999 and 1998,  respectively,
representing  increases  of 21% from  1999 to 2000  and 31%  from  1998 to 1999.
General and administrative  expenses, as a percentage of net revenues,  were 9%,
10% and 11% in 2000, 1999, and 1998,  respectively.  General and  administrative
expenses  consist  primarily  of personnel  costs for  finance,  administration,
operations and general management, as well as legal and accounting expenses. The
increases,  in absolute dollars, were primarily due to an increase in the number
of personnel and related costs to support our growth.

    Amortization  of  Intangibles.  We recorded  amortization  of intangibles of
approximately  $1.5  million  for 2000 and  1999.  This  was  based on  recorded
goodwill of $5.6 million in  connection  with the  acquisitions  of Hub Data and
Advent Australia,  formerly named Portfolio  Management  Systems,  Pty. Ltd. The
revenues and costs associated with the goodwill have been materially  consistent
with the assumptions we used in the valuation.  Since the valuation was based on
our estimates of market potential, product introductions, and technology trends,
we will  periodically  assess our estimates  related to the  valuation  model to
determine if the assets acquired have been impaired.  If we determine that there
has been impairment, there could be additional charges to income.

     Purchased  Research  and  Development  and  Other.  In May 1998,  we issued
510,000  shares of Common  Stock for  certain  assets of the  Grants  Management
Division of Blackbaud,  Inc. and incurred a charge for  in-process  research and
development  and  other  expenses  of  $5.4  million  in  connection  with  this
transaction.  In November 1998, we incurred a charge for in-process research and
development of $3.0 million in connection  with the  acquisition of Hub Data. In
determining  the amount of in-process  research and  development,  we engaged an
independent  valuation firm to conduct an appraisal of the acquired assets.  The
intangible  assets  acquired,  including  in-process  research  and  development
expenses,  were valued based on estimates of future net cash flows discounted to
their present value at risk-adjusted rates of return.

     The in-process  research and development charge for Hub Data was determined
by  estimating  the net cash  flows  from the  sale of the  resulting  projects,
discounted  to net present value using a 25% discount rate and also assumed that
the project was approximately 61% complete.

     The Blackbaud  transaction  resulted in the  acquisition of certain assets,
but not an ongoing business.  The assets acquired included rights to Blackbaud's
32-bit in-process technology, access to certain Blackbaud source code to be used
in developing  new Advent  products,  a non-compete  agreement and access to the
Blackbaud  customer  base.  The acquired  technology  was  purchased  for use in
Advent's  research  and  development  "grant  management"  project  and  had  no
alternative future use. Interest and Other Income, Net

     Interest and other income, net was approximately $6.8 million, $4.6 million
and $1.4  million  in 2000,  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  Interest  and other
income,  net consists of interest  income,  interest  expense and  miscellaneous
non-operating  income and expense items.  The increase from 1999 to 2000 was due
to higher  interest  income  generated  from higher  interest  rates and greater
balances  available  for  investment.  The increase from 1998 to 1999 was due to
higher  interest  income from the  increased  cash  received  from our secondary
offering and from a one-time gain of $1.2 million on the sale of securities. The
securities  were  warrants  from  one of our  Alliance  partners  as part of our
initial  business  relationship  that we  converted to stock and sold during the
fourth quarter of 1999.

Income Taxes

     We had  effective  income tax rates of 34%,  34% and 40% in 2000,  1999 and
1998, respectively. These rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily
due to state income tax, offset by certain research and development credits. The
lower  income  tax rates in 2000 and 1999  were  primarily  due to tax  planning
strategies  implemented  in the second half of 1998. The higher rate in 1998 was
due to certain  acquisition  related charges  incurred during 1998 that were not
deductible for tax purposes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    Our cash and cash  equivalents  at  December  31,  2000 were $97.0  million,
increasing  by $32.7  million  from $64.3  million at December  31,  1999.  This
increase was due to $12.5  million  provided by financing  activities  and $37.1
million  provided  by  operating  activities  offset  by $16.9  million  used in
investing activities.

    The net cash  provided from  operating  activities of $37.1 million for 2000
was primarily  due to net income and increases in deferred  revenues and accrued
liabilities  offset by increases in accounts  receivable  as well as prepaid and
other  current  assets.  Financing  activities  provided  $12.5 million for 2000
primarily  due to proceeds  of the  exercise  of stock  options and  issuance of
Common Stock in connection  with our employee stock purchase plan. Net cash used
in  investing  activities  of  $16.9  million  for  2000  related  primarily  to
expenditures  of  $10.4  million  for  furniture,  fixtures  and  equipment  and
leasehold  improvements  to build out our new leased New York  office  space and
additional  office space leased in San Francisco,  California.  Further activity
included  prepayment  of $3.8 million to several  strategic  partners to further
bring new products and services to our clients.

    At December 31, 2000, we had $161.0 million in working capital. We currently
have no significant  capital  commitments other than commitments under operating
leases.  We believe that our  available  sources of funds and  anticipated  cash
flows from  operations  will be  adequate  to  finance  current  operations  and
anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.

    Subsequent  to year end, in January  2001,  we acquired all the  outstanding
capital stock of Rex  Development  Partners,  L.P., a limited  partnership,  for
approximately $8.5 million in cash.

New Accounting Pronouncements

     In  March  2000,   the   Financial   Accounting   Standards   Board  issued
Interpretation  No. 44,  "Accounting  for Certain  Transactions  Involving Stock
Compensation,  an  Interpretation  of APB No. 25" ("FIN 44"). FIN 44 establishes
guidance for the accounting for stock option grants or modifications to existing
stock option  awards and was  generally  effective  July 1, 2000. We adopted the
requirements of FIN 44 and those  requirements did not have a significant effect
on our current financial position or results of operations.

     In December 1999, the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements"
("SAB  101"),  which  provides  guidance on the  recognition,  presentation  and
disclosure  of  revenue in  financial  statements  filed  with the SEC.  SAB 101
outlines the basic  criteria that must be met to recognize  revenue and provides
guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies. We adopted SAB
101, as amended, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. The adoption did not have
a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations.

     In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting  Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities"  ("SFAS 133").  SFAS 133  established  new standards of
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS
133 requires  that all  derivatives  be  recognized at fair value in the balance
sheet  and that the  corresponding  gains or losses  be  reported  either in the
statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income,  depending on
the facts and circumstances. SFAS 133, as amended, is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. We do not currently hold  derivative  instruments
or engage in hedging activities.

Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements

     The  discussion  in  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial
Condition  and  Results of  Operations"  and  elsewhere  in this  Annual  Report
contains trend analysis and other  forward-looking  statements that are based on
current  expectations  and  assumptions  made  by  management.   Words  such  as
"expects", "anticipates",  "intends", "plans", "believes", "seeks", "estimates",
and  variations of such words and similar  expressions  are intended to identify
such forward-looking  statements.  These statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties,  which are difficult to
predict.  Therefore, actual results could differ materially from those expressed
or  forecasted  in the  forward-looking  statements  as a result of the  factors
summarized  below  and  other  risks  detailed  from  time  to  time  in  public
announcements,  registration  statements and filings with the SEC, including our
2000 Annual Report to  Stockholders,  incorporated by reference in our 2000 Form
10-K.  Additionally,  the financial statements for the periods presented are not
necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period.

     We  operate in a rapidly  changing  environment  that  involves a number of
risks,  some of which are beyond our control.  These risks include the potential
for period to period  fluctuations  in operating  results and the  dependence on
continued market acceptance of our product, Axys, and the successful development
and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements on a timely, cost
effective basis, as well as the stability of financial  markets,  maintenance of
our  relationship  with  Interactive  Data  and  price  and  product/performance
competition.  In particular,  our net revenues and operating results have varied
substantially  from  period to period on a quarterly  basis and may  continue to
fluctuate  due to a number of  factors.  Our  software  products  typically  are
shipped shortly after receipt of a signed license agreement.  License backlog at
the beginning of any quarter  typically  represents only a small portion of that
quarter's expected revenues.  In addition, as licenses into multi-user networked
environments increase both in individual size and number, the timing and size of
individual license transactions are becoming  increasingly  important factors in
our quarterly  operating  results.  The sales cycles for these  transactions are
often  lengthy  and  unpredictable,  and the  ability  to  close  large  license
transactions on a timely basis or at all could cause  additional  variability in
our  quarterly  operating  results.  We also expect that our gross and operating
margins may  fluctuate  from period to period as we  continue to  introduce  new
recurring revenue products,  expand our professional  services  organization and
associated  revenue,  continue to hire  additional  personnel and increase other
expenses to support our business.  We plan our expense levels based primarily on
forecasted  revenue levels.  Because these expenses are relatively  fixed in the
short term, a fluctuation in revenue could lead to operating  results  differing
from expectations.

     In  addition,  a number of  factors  including  market  volatility,  global
economic  uncertainty and reductions in capital  expenditures by large customers
could adversely impact our results.  The target clients for our products include
a range of organizations that manage investment portfolios, including investment
advisors,  brokerage  firms,  banks  and hedge  funds.  In  addition,  we target
corporations,  public funds,  universities and non-profit  organizations,  which
also manage  investment  portfolios and have many of the same needs. The success
of many of our clients is  intrinsically  linked to the health of the  financial
markets.  We believe  that demand for our products  could be  disproportionately
affected by fluctuations, disruptions, instability or downturns in the financial
markets which may cause  clients and  potential  clients to exit the industry or
delay,  cancel or reduce any  planned  expenditures  for  investment  management
systems and software products.

     The market for investment  management software is intensely competitive and
highly  fragmented,  subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product
introductions  and marketing efforts by industry  participants.  Our competitors
include  providers  of software  and related  services as well as  providers  of
timeshare services.  Our competitors vary in size, scope of services offered and
platforms  supported.  In  addition,  we compete  indirectly  with  existing and
potential clients,  many of whom develop their own software for their particular
needs and therefore  may be reluctant to license  software  products  offered by
independent  vendors  like us. Many of our  competitors  have  longer  operating
histories and greater financial,  technical,  sales and marketing resources than
we do. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete  successfully against
current and future competitors or that competitive  pressures will not result in
price reductions, reduced operating margins and loss of market share, any one of
which could seriously harm our business.

     Our future  success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop our
products,  such as Advent Office suite, and Geneva, that continue to address the
future needs of our target markets and to respond to emerging industry standards
and practices.  To take advantage of the Internet,  we have launched an Internet
Initiative whereby we are developing  services,  both announced and unannounced,
to bring  Internet-based  products and services to clients. We cannot assure you
that there will not be  disruptions in Internet  services  beyond our control or
that of other third parties.  Any such disruptions could harm our business.  The
Internet  is a public  network,  and data is sent  over this  network  from many
sources. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to
protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate  problems caused
by  breaches.  To the extent  that our  activities  may  involve the storage and
transmission of proprietary information,  security breaches could expose us to a
risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.  Our security measures may be
inadequate to prevent security breaches,  and our business would be harmed if we
do not prevent them.

    We are directing a significant amount of our product  development efforts to
our Internet  Initiative and the on-going  development of Geneva. The failure to
achieve  widespread market acceptance of Geneva or our Internet  Initiative on a
timely basis would  adversely  affect our business and  operating  results.  The
success of our  Internet  Initiative,  in  particular,  is  difficult to predict
because it  represents  a new area of business  for our entire  industry.  As we
continue to develop new  products  and  services,  we have and will  continue to
enter into development agreements with information providers,  clients, or other
companies in order to  accelerate  the  delivery of new  products and  services.
There can be no assurance  that we will be  successful in marketing our existing
products,  new product or  modifications  of our products.  Our failure to do so
could adversely affect our business and operating results.

     Our products may contain undetected  software errors or failures when first
introduced or as new versions are released. Despite testing by us and by current
and  potential  customers,  errors may not be found in new products  until after
commencement of commercial shipments,  resulting in loss of or a delay in market
acceptance, which could seriously harm our business.

     Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology.  Despite
our  efforts to protect  our  proprietary  technology,  it may be  possible  for
unauthorized  third  parties to copy  certain  portions  of our  products  or to
reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information.  We do
not  have  any  patents,   and  existing  copyright  laws  afford  only  limited
protection.  In  addition,  we cannot be certain  that  others  will not develop
substantially   equivalent  or  superseding  proprietary  technology,   or  that
equivalent  products  will not be marketed  in  competition  with our  products,
thereby  substantially  reducing the value of our proprietary  rights. We cannot
assure you that we will develop  proprietary  products or technologies  that are
patentable,  that any patent,  if issued,  would provide us with any competitive
advantages or would not be challenged by third  parties,  or that the patents of
others will not adversely  affect our ability to do business.  Litigation may be
necessary  to  protect  our  proprietary  technology.  This  litigation  may  be
time-consuming and expensive.

     We have expanded in recent  periods into a number of new business  areas to
foster long-term growth including  international  operations.  We currently have
limited  experience  in  developing  localized  versions  of  our  products  and
marketing  and   distributing   our  products   internationally.   In  addition,
international  operations are subject to other inherent  risks,  including:  the
impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;  greater difficulty
in accounts  receivable  collection and longer  collection  periods;  unexpected
changes in regulatory  requirements;  difficulties in successfully  adapting our
products  to  the  language,   regulatory  and  technology  standards  of  other
countries;  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign  operations;
reduced   protection  for  intellectual   property  rights  in  some  countries;
potentially adverse tax consequences; and political and economic instability.

     We may acquire or make investments in complementary companies,  products or
technologies.  In addition,  we continually  evaluate the performance of all our
products  and  product  lines and may sell or  discontinue  current  products or
product lines. If we buy a company, we could have difficulty in integrating that
company's  personnel  and  operations.  In  addition,  the key  personnel of the
acquired  company  may  decide  not to work for us.  If we make  other  types of
acquisitions,  we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired  technology
or products into our operations.  These  difficulties  could disrupt our ongoing
business,  distract our  management  and  employees  and increase our  expenses.
Furthermore,  we may have to incur debt, write-off software development costs or
other assets, incur severance liabilities, amortize expenses related to goodwill
and other  intangible  assets or issue equity  securities  to pay for any future
acquisitions.  The  issuance  of equity  securities  could  dilute our  existing
stockholders' ownership.

     Our continued  success depends,  in part, on the services of several of our
key  executive,  technical  and sales  employees.  The loss of services of these
personnel,  or our  inability  to identify,  attract,  motivate and retain other
qualified  management,  technical,  and sales  employees,  could have a material
adverse  effect on our  business and results of  operations.  Because our future
success is  dependent  on our ability to continue to enhance and  introduce  new
products,  we are  particularly  dependent on our ability to identify,  attract,
motivate  and  retain   qualified   engineers  with  the  requisite   education,
backgrounds and industry experience.

     Our operations are vulnerable to  interruption by fire,  earthquake,  power
loss,   telecommunications   failure  and  other  events   beyond  our  control.
Additionally,  electrical  blackouts or high prices resulting from a shortage of
available  electrical  power  could  disrupt  our  operations  or  increase  our
operating costs.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Operations We provide  stand-alone and  client/server  software  products,  data
interfaces and related  maintenance  and services that  automate,  integrate and
support certain mission-critical  functions of the front, middle and back office
of investment management  organizations.  Our clients vary significantly in size
and assets under management and include  investment  advisors,  brokerage firms,
banks, hedge funds,  corporations,  public funds, foundations,  universities and
non-profit organizations.

Principles of consolidation The consolidated  financial  statements  include the
accounts  of  Advent  and  its  wholly-owned   subsidiaries.   All  intercompany
transactions and amounts have been eliminated.

Cash and cash  equivalents  Cash  equivalents  are  comprised  of highly  liquid
investments  purchased  with an  original  maturity  of 90 days or  less.  These
securities are maintained with major financial institutions.

Marketable  securities  All of  our  marketable  securities  are  classified  as
available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale  securities  are  carried at fair value,
with the unrealized gains and losses, net of any related tax effect, reported in
accumulated  components of comprehensive  income in stockholders'  equity in the
accompanying  consolidated  financial statements.  Realized gains and losses and
declines  in  value  judged  to be  other-than-temporary  on  available-for-sale
securities are included in interest and other income,  net, in the  accompanying
consolidated  statements  of  operations.   At  December  31,  2000,  marketable
securities are summarized as follows (in thousands):

</TABLE>

At December 31, 2000, all marketable debt securities had scheduled maturities of
less than two years.  Marketable  debt  securities  totaling  $76  million  have
maturities  of  less  than  3  months  and  are  classified  as  cash  and  cash
equivalents. The remaining is included in short-term marketable securities.

Fair value of financial  instruments The amounts reported for cash  equivalents,
marketable securities, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are
considered  to  approximate  their  market  values  based on  comparable  market
information available at the respective balance sheet dates and their short-term
nature.

Depreciation and amortization  Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation  and  amortization.  Depreciation  and  amortization are calculated
using the  straight-line  method over the estimated  useful lives of the related
assets,   ranging  from  three  to  seven  years.   Depreciation   of  leasehold
improvements is computed using the straight-line  method over the shorter of the
estimated  useful life of the assets or the  remaining  lease term.  Repairs and
maintenance  expenditures,  which  are not  considered  improvements  and do not
extend the useful life of the property and equipment,  are expenses as incurred.
The cost  and  related  accumulated  depreciation  applicable  to  property  and
equipment sold or no longer in service are eliminated  from the accounts and any
gains or losses are included in operations.

Capitalized   software  Costs  incurred  for  software   development   prior  to
technological  feasibility  are  expensed  as product  development  costs in the
period  incurred.  Once  the  point of  technological  feasibility  is  reached,
development costs are capitalized. Amounts that could have been capitalized were
insignificant and therefore, no costs have been capitalized to date.

Capitalization of web site development costs Costs incurred for web site design,
creation and maintenance of content, graphics and user interface are expensed as
incurred. Costs for development of web site applications and infrastructures are
capitalized and amortized over their  estimated  useful life of typically two to
four years.  Web site  development  costs of  approximately  $877,000  primarily
related  to  the  internal   development  of  infrastructure  for  our  Internet
Initiatives were capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2000.

Investments  Investments,  included in other assets,  consisted of nonmarketable
investments in private companies,  which are carried at the lower of cost or net
realizable  value.  The Company  monitors these  investments  for impairment and
makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary.

Revenue  recognition We license  application  software programs and offer annual
maintenance programs which provide for technical support and updates to software
products.  Our  development  agreements  generally  provide for  development  of
technologies  and  products  that are  expected to become part of our product or
product offerings in the future. Certain agreements may require royalty payments
based on future sales of the developed  products.  Such amounts will be included
in cost of revenues when the related  revenues are recognized.  In addition,  we
offer other recurring revenue products and services that are  subscription-based
and transaction-based. We also offer professional services consisting of on-site
consulting services,  training,  custom report writing, and other services, such
as semi-annual conferences.

We adopted the  provisions of Statement of Position 97-2 ("SOP 97-2"),  Software
Revenue  Recognition,  as amended,  which sets forth the accounting for software
product and maintenance  revenue.  Under SOP 97-2, we recognize  license revenue
upon shipment of a product to the client if a signed contract exists, the fee is
fixed or determinable,  and collection of resulting receivables is probable. For
contracts with multiple  obligations (e.g.  delivered and undelivered  products,
maintenance and other  services),  we allocate  revenue to each component of the
contract  based on  objective  evidence of its fair value,  which is specific to
Advent. We recognize revenue allocated to undelivered products when the criteria
for product  revenue set forth above is met. We recognize  revenue  allocated to
maintenance  fees for ongoing  customer support and product updates ratably over
the  period of the  maintenance  contract.  Payments  for  maintenance  fees are
generally  made in advance and are  non-refundable.  Revenues for  interface and
other  development and custom report writing are recognized using the percentage
of completion  method of accounting based on the costs incurred to date compared
with the estimated cost of completion.  Payments for subscription-based products
and   services   are   generally   made  in  advance  and  are   non-refundable.
Subscription-based  revenues  are  recognized  ratably  over the  period  of the
contract.   Transaction-based   revenues  are  generally   recognized  when  the
transactions are delivered.  Revenues from professional  services are recognized
when the services are performed.

Net income per share  Basic net income per share is  computed  by  dividing  net
income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares  outstanding  for that  period.  Diluted net income per share is computed
giving  effect to all dilutive  potential  common  shares that were  outstanding
during the period.  Dilutive  potential  shares  consist of  incremental  common
shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and conversion of preferred stock
(none  outstanding)  for all periods.  All share and  per-share  data  presented
reflect the  three-for-two  stock split  effective July 1999 and the two-for-one
stock split effective February 2000 (See Note 8).

Reclassifications  Certain  prior year  amounts  have been  reclassified  to the
current year presentation.

Segment  information  We have  determined  that  Advent has a single  reportable
segment  consisting of the  development,  marketing and sale of stand-alone  and
client/server  software  products,  data interfaces and related  maintenance and
services that automate, integrate and support certain mission critical functions
of investment management organizations.
Management uses one measurement of  profitability  and does not disaggregate its
business for internal reporting.  Our international operations in 2000, 1999 and
1998 have not been material to revenue or net income.

Use of estimates The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  the
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting period.  These estimates are based on information  available as of the
date of the  financial  statements.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those
estimates.

Certain risks and  concentrations  Our product  revenues are concentrated in the
computer software  industry,  which is highly  competitive and rapidly changing.
Significant  technological changes in the industry or customer requirements,  or
the emergence of  competitive  products with new  capabilities  or  technologies
could adversely affect operating results.

Financial  instruments that potentially  subject us to  concentrations of credit
risks comprise,  principally,  cash, short-term marketable securities, and trade
accounts  receivable.  We invest excess cash through  banks,  mutual funds,  and
brokerage  houses  primarily in highly  liquid  securities  and have  investment
policies and procedures that are reviewed  periodically to minimize credit risk.
Our short-term  marketable  securities  consist of diversified  investment grade
securities.  We believe no significant  concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to these securities.

With respect to accounts  receivable,  we perform ongoing credit  evaluations of
our customers and generally do not require collateral.  We maintain reserves for
potential credit losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary.  At December
31, 2000, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts  receivable or 10%
of revenues for the year ended.

Accounting for long-lived  assets We review  property,  equipment,  goodwill and
other   intangible   assets  for  impairment   whenever  events  or  changes  in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may  not  be
recoverable.  Recoverability is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to
future net cash flows the assets are  expected to  generate.  If such assets are
considered  to be impaired,  the  impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying  amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value.
Intangibles are amortized over their estimated  useful lives (typically three to
seven years).

 Foreign currency  translation The functional currency of our foreign subsidiary
is the local  currency,  the  Australian  dollar.  All  assets  and  liabilities
denominated in foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange
rate on the balance sheet date.  Revenues,  costs and expenses are translated at
average rate of exchange during the period.

Comprehensive income Comprehensive income consists of net income, net unrealized
foreign   currency   translation   adjustment  and  net   unrealized   gains  on
available-for-sale  marketable  securities and is presented in the  consolidated
statements of stockholders' equity and comprehensive income.

Advertising costs We expense  advertising  costs as incurred.  Total advertising
expenses were  approximately  $77,000  $173,000 and $134,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Stock-based compensation We elected to continue to use the intrinsic value-based
method as allowed under  Accounting  Principles  Board  ("APB")  Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees",  to  account  for  all  of  our
stock-based employee  compensation plans.  Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation", we are required to disclose the pro forma effects
on  operating  results as if we had  elected to use the fair value  approach  to
account for all our stock-based employee compensation plans (See Note 8).

New accounting  pronouncements In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board  issued  Interpretation  No.  44,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Transactions
Involving Stock  Compensation,  an Interpretation of APB No. 25" ("FIN 44"). FIN
44  establishes   guidance  for  the  accounting  for  stock  option  grants  or
modifications  to existing stock option awards and was generally  effective July
1, 2000. We adopted the  requirements of FIN 44 and those  requirements  did not
have a  significant  effect on our  current  financial  position  or  results of
operations.

In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB
101"),  which provides guidance on the recognition,  presentation and disclosure
of revenue in  financial  statements  filed with the SEC.  SAB 101  outlines the
basic criteria that must be met to recognize  revenue and provides  guidance for
disclosures  related to revenue  recognition  policies.  We adopted  SAB 101, as
amended,  in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2000.  The  adoption  did not have a
significant effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement of
Financial Accounting  Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments
and Hedging  Activities"  ("SFAS 133").  SFAS 133  establishes  new standards of
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS
133 requires  that all  derivatives  be  recognized at fair value in the balance
sheet  and that the  corresponding  gains or losses  be  reported  either in the
statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income,  depending on
the facts and circumstances.  We do not currently hold derivative instruments or
engage in hedging activities.

2.  Acquisitions

     In February  1998, we issued 750,000 shares of Common Stock in exchange for
all of the outstanding shares of MicroEdge. MicroEdge is the leading provider of
software products to foundations, corporations and other organizations to manage
their grant-making activities.  This business combination was accounted for as a
pooling of interests, and the results of operations of MicroEdge are included in
our financial statements beginning January 1, 1998. The results of operations as
well as the assets and  liabilities  of MicroEdge,  in prior  periods,  were not
material  to our  consolidated  results of  operations  or  financial  position.
Accordingly,  we did not restate our financial  statements  for periods prior to
January 1, 1998.

     In May 1998, we issued 510,000 shares of Common Stock for certain assets of
the Grants Management Division of Blackbaud,  Inc. This acquisition combines the
grants management product line of Blackbaud with MicroEdge. This transaction was
accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  are included in our
financial statements beginning on the acquisition date. We incurred a charge for
in-process  research  and  development  and other  expenses  of $5.4  million in
connection with this  transaction.  We believe that the technology  acquired had
not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative future use. Other
intangibles  of $2.0 million were recorded in connection  with this  acquisition
and are being amortized over a period of 5 years.

     In November  1998,  we issued  45,000  shares of Common Stock and paid $4.1
million  in  exchange  for all the  outstanding  shares  of Hub  Data,  Inc.,  a
distributor  of  consolidated  securities  information  and  data to  investment
management  organizations.  Hub Data is located in Cambridge,  Massachusetts and
delivers  services to over 240  institutional  investment  firms.  This business
combination  was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of operations  for
Hub Data are included in our financial  statements  beginning on the acquisition
date. We incurred a charge  relating to in-process  research and  development of
$3.0 million in connection with this transaction. We believe that the technology
acquired had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. As a result of net  liabilities  assumed and  acquisition  expenses of $1.6
million,  goodwill  of  $3.2  million  was  recorded  in  connection  with  this
transaction and is being amortized over a 7 year period.

     In November  1998,  we paid AUS  $583,000  (approximately  US  $370,000) in
exchange for all the outstanding shares of Portfolio  Management  Systems,  Pty.
Ltd., a distributor of Advent products in Australia.  This business  combination
was accounted  for as a purchase and the results of  operations  are included in
our financial  statements  beginning on the acquisition  date. This  acquisition
provides an  international  channel for sale of our products and services.  As a
result of net  liabilities  assumed and  acquisition  expenses of $2.0  million,
goodwill of $2.4 million was recorded in connection with this transaction and is
being amortized over a period of 43 months.  Subsequent to the  acquisition,  we
changed the name of this subsidiary to Advent Australia. 3.

     We lease office space and equipment  under  noncancelable  operating  lease
agreements,  which expire at various  dates  through June 2010.  Some  operating
leases  contain  escalation  provisions  for  adjustments  in the consumer price
index.  We are responsible for  maintenance,  insurance,  and property taxes and
have five-year extension options on our primary facility leases.  Future minimum
payments under the  noncancelable  operating  leases consist of the following at

6.  Employee Benefit Plans

     401(k) Plan

     We  have  a  401(k)  deferred  savings  plan  covering   substantially  all
employees. Employee contributions, limited to 15% of compensation up to $10,500,
are matched  50% by Advent,  up to 6% of  employee  compensation  for the period
ended  December  31, 2000 and up to a maximum of $500 per  employee per year for
all prior periods.  Matching contributions by Advent in 2000, 1999 and 1998 were
approximately $1,045,000,  $157,000 and $117,000,  respectively.  In addition to
the employer matching contribution, Advent may make profit sharing contributions
at the  discretion  of the  Board  of  Directors.  Advent  made  profit  sharing
contributions of approximately $374,000, $218,000 and $143,000 in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

     1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     All  individuals  employed  by Advent are  eligible to  participate  in the
Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan  ("Purchase  Plan") if Advent employs them for at
least 20 hours per week and at least five  months per year.  The  Purchase  Plan
permits  eligible  employees to purchase  Advent's  Common Stock through payroll
deductions  at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the  closing  sale price for
Advent's  Common Stock reported on the NASDAQ  National  Market at the beginning
and the end of each six-month  offering period.  In any calendar year,  eligible
employees  can  withhold  up  to  10%  of  their  salary  and  certain  variable
compensation.  A total of 900,000  shares of Common Stock have been reserved for
issuance under the Purchase Plan of which approximately 563,000 shares have been
issued.  Approximately,  74,000 102,000 and 114,000 shares were sold through the
Purchase Plan in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

8.   Stockholders' Equity

Secondary Offering

         In June 1999, we completed a secondary  public  offering of 3.9 million
shares of Common  Stock at an offering  price of $20.688  per share.  Of the 3.9
million  shares of Common Stock  offered,  300,000 shares were sold by a selling
stockholder. The net proceeds of the offering to Advent were $70.2 million.

Stock Splits

     Our Board of Directors  approved a three-for-two  split of our Common Stock
in July 1999. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend.  Stockholders of
record as of the close of business  on July 30,  1999 were issued a  certificate
representing  one  additional  Common Share for every two shares of Common Stock
held on the record date. These certificates were distributed on August 16, 1999.
This stock split increased the number of shares  outstanding from  approximately
9.6 million shares to approximately 14.4 million shares.

     Our Board of Directors  approved a two-for-one split of our Common Stock in
February 2000. The stock split was effected as a stock dividend. Stockholders of
record  as of the  close  of  business  on  February  28,  2000  were  issued  a
certificate  representing  one additional  Common Share for each share of Common
Stock held on the record date. These  certificates were distributed on March 13,
2000. The stock split increased the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
from approximately 14.8 million shares to approximately 29.6 million shares.

     All shares and per share data in these  consolidated  financial  statements
have been adjusted to reflect both stock splits.

Stock Options

     Under  Advent's  1992 Stock Plan  ("Plan") we may grant options to purchase
Common  Stock to employees  and  consultants.  Options  granted may be incentive
stock options or nonstatutory  stock options and shall be granted at a price not
less than fair market value on the date of grant.  Fair market value (as defined
in the Plan) and the vesting of these  options  shall be determined by the Board
of Directors.  The options  generally vest over 5 years and expire no later than
10 years from the date of grant.  Unvested  options on termination of employment
are canceled and returned to the Plan.

Nonstatutory  Plan) and the vesting of these  options shall be determined by the
Board of Directors.  The options generally vest over 5 years and expire no later
than 10  years  from the date of  grant.  Unvested  options  on  termination  of
employment are canceled and returned to the Nonstatutory Plan.

At  December  31,  2000 and  1999,  18,200  and  42,000  options  under the 1998
Nonstatutory Plan were exercisable with an aggregate  exercise price of $229,000
and $521,000,  respectively.  No options outstanding at December 31, 1998, under
the 1998 Nonstatutory Plan, were exercisable.
<PAGE>
     During the year ended  December 31, 2000, we recorded  $136,000 of deferred
stock-based  charges  related to  options  granted  to  certain  employees  of a
distributor.  The total stock-based compensation charge is being recognized over
a five year vesting period. Stock-based charges recorded are subject to variable
plan  accounting,   which  requires  us  to  remeasure   compensation  cost  for
outstanding  options each reporting  period based on changes in the market value
of the underlying common stock.

     In  addition  to the Plan and the  Nonstatutory  Plan,  Advent had  granted
options to purchase  Common  Stock to  employees or  consultants  under  special
arrangements. These options have an exercise price of $.34 per share. There were
14,000,  14,000 and 21,000 of these  options  outstanding  at December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998,  respectively.  The change in 1999 was the result of the exercise
of 7,000 options. The options outstanding at December 31, 2000 are fully vested.

     Our 1995 Director Option Plan  ("Director  Plan") provides for the grant of
nonstatutory  stock  options  to  non-employee  directors  of  Advent  ("Outside
Directors").  Under the  Director  Plan,  each  Outside  Director  is  granted a
non-qualified  option to purchase 30,000 shares on the last to occur of the date
of  effectiveness  of the Director Plan or the date upon which such person first
becomes a director  with an exercise  price  equal to the fair  market  value of
Advent's  Common Stock as of the date of the grant.  In subsequent  years,  each
Outside Director is automatically  granted an option to purchase 6,000 shares on
December 1 with an exercise  price  equal to the fair value of  Advent's  Common
Stock on that date.  Options  granted  under the Director  Plan vest over a five
year period and have a ten year term.

     We  have  adopted  the   disclosure-only   provisions   of  SFAS  No.  123.
Accordingly,  no compensation cost has been recognized for Advent's stock option
plans. If compensation  had been determined based on the fair value at the grant
date for awards in 2000,  1999 and 1998  consistent  with the provisions of SFAS
No.  123,  Advent's  net  income  and net  income  per share for the year  ended

     The fair  value for the  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  rights  were also
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes  options pricing model with
the following  assumptions for 2000, 1999 and 1998:  risk-free interest rates of
6.3%, 5.9% and 4.9%,  respectively;  dividend yield of 0%; volatility factors of
63.7%,  58.7% and 60.4% for 2000, 1999 and 1998,  respectively;  and a six-month
expected  life.  The weighted  average fair value of the ESPP rights  granted in
2000, 1999 and 1998 were $15.24, $6.52 and $3.21, respectively.

9.    Subsequent Events

     On January 31,  2001,  we acquired  all  outstanding  capital  stock of Rex
Development  Partners,  L.P.,  a limited  partnership,  for  approximately  $8.5
million in cash. The acquisition will be recorded in the quarter ended March 31,
2001,  using the purchase method of accounting and we expect that  substantially
all of the  purchase  price  will  be  allocated  to  purchased  technology  and
goodwill.

     In March 2001, Advent's Board of Directors  authorized the repurchase of up
to one million  shares of outstanding  Common Stock.  The purchases may be made,
from time to time,  on the open market or in privately  negotiated  transactions
and will be funded from available working capital.  The repurchase program is to
provide  shares for issuing to employees  under stock option and stock  purchase
plans.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Advent Software, Inc.:

     In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  and the
related   consolidated   statements   of  income   and   comprehensive   income,
stockholders'  equity and cash flows present fairly,  in all material  respects,
the financial position of Advent Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December
31, 2000 and  December 31, 1999,  and the results of their  operations  and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31,  2000,  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  These  financial  statements are the  responsibility  of the Company's
management;  our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements  based on our audit.  We conducted our audits of these  statements in
accordance with auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United States of
America  which  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

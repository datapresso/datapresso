COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS&#13;
&#13;
         Directors  who are  employees of the Company do not receive  additional&#13;

nonemployee members of the Board of Directors receive an annual cash retainer of&#13;
$5,000 and $1,250 for  attendance  at each  meeting of the Board of Directors or&#13;
any committee thereof.&#13;

Director  Option Plan (the "Director  Plan").  The Director Plan was approved by&#13;
the Board in October 1995 and was ratified by  stockholders in November 1995, at&#13;
which time a total of 75,000  shares of Common Stock were  reserved for issuance&#13;
thereunder. As of March 5, 1999, there were 56,000 options outstanding under the&#13;
Director Plan.  The Director Plan became  effective on the date of the Company's&#13;
initial public  offering on November 15, 1995, and is currently  administered by&#13;
the Board of Directors.  Under the Director Plan, each  nonemployee  director is&#13;
automatically  granted a  non-qualified  option to purchase 10,000 shares on the&#13;
date upon which such person first becomes a director (the "Initial Option") with&#13;
an exercise  price equal to the fair market value of the Company's  Common Stock&#13;
as of the date of grant. Thereafter,  each nonemployee director is automatically&#13;
granted an option to purchase 2,000 shares of Common Stock on December 1 of each&#13;
year,  except in the year the Director Plan was adopted  ("Subsequent  Option"),&#13;
provided  he or she has served as a director  for at least six months as of such&#13;
date.&#13;
&#13;
         Options granted under the Director Plan have a term of ten years unless&#13;
terminated  sooner upon  termination of the  optionee's  status as a director or&#13;
otherwise  pursuant to the Director Plan.  Such options are  transferable by the&#13;
optionee only in certain  limited  circumstances  and each option is exercisable&#13;
during  the  lifetime  of the  director  only by such  director  or a  permitted&#13;
transferee.  Initial  Options  granted under the Director Plan vest as to 20% of&#13;
the  shares  on the  first  anniversary  date of grant  and as to the  remaining&#13;
shares, ratably each month over the ensuing four years. Subsequent Options begin&#13;
to vest on the fourth  anniversary  of the date of grant and vest  ratably  each&#13;
month over the next 12 month  period.  The  Director  Plan is  designed  to work&#13;
automatically, without administration;  however, to the extent administration is&#13;
necessary,  the Director  Plan has been  structured  so that options  granted to&#13;
nonemployee  directors who administer the Company's other employee benefit plans&#13;
shall qualify as  transactions  exempt from Section 16(b) of the  Securities and&#13;
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Exchange  Act"),  pursuant to Rule 16b-3&#13;
promulgated thereunder.&#13;
&#13;
REQUIRED VOTE&#13;
&#13;
         The five nominees  receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of&#13;
the shares  present or  represented  and  entitled to be voted for them shall be&#13;
elected  as  directors,  whether  or not such  affirmative  votes  constitute  a&#13;
majority of the shares voted.  Votes  withheld from any director are counted for&#13;
purposes of determining  the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction&#13;
of business, but they have no legal effect under Delaware law.&#13;
&#13;
           MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE NOMINEES LISTED ABOVE.&#13;

           RATIFICATION OF AND APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S&#13;
                                 1992 STOCK PLAN&#13;
&#13;
         The  Company's  Board of Directors  and  stockholders  have  previously&#13;
adopted and approved the Company's 1992 Stock Plan. A total of 2,288,000  shares&#13;
of Common Stock are  presently  reserved for issuance  under the Stock Plan.  In&#13;
February 1999,  the Board of Directors  approved an amendment to the Stock Plan,&#13;
subject to stockholder  approval,  to increase the shares  reserved for issuance&#13;
thereunder by 600,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares issuable under&#13;
the Stock Plan to 2,888,000. In addition, the Board approved an amendment to add&#13;
an automatic  replenishment  feature to the Stock Plan which would  increase the&#13;
number of shares  issuable under the Stock Plan on December 31 of 1999, 2000 and&#13;
2001 the lesser of (i) 500,000,  (ii) 3% of the outstanding  Common Stock on the&#13;
date  of  increase  or  (iii) a  lesser  amount  determined  by the  Board  (the&#13;
"Evergreen  Provision").  As of March 5, 1999,  47,500 shares were available for&#13;
future issuance under the Stock Plan. The Company also has a Nonstatutory  Stock&#13;
Plan which provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options to non-executive&#13;
officer  employees.  As of March 5, 1999, 8,000 shares were available for future&#13;
issuance under the Nonstatutory Stock Plan.&#13;
&#13;
At the Annual  Meeting,  the  Stockholders  are being  requested to consider and&#13;
approve the  proposed  amendments  to the Stock Plan to  increase  the number of&#13;
shares of Common  Stock  reserved  for issuance  thereunder  by 600,000  shares,&#13;
bringing the total number of shares  issuable  under the Stock Plan to 2,888,000&#13;
and to approve the addition of the  Evergreen  Provision to the Stock Plan.  The&#13;
Board  believes  that the  amendments  will enable the  Company to continue  its&#13;
policy of widespread employee stock ownership as a means to motivate high levels&#13;
of  performance  and to recognize  key employee  accomplishments.  At the Annual&#13;
Meeting,  the Stockholders will also be asked to ratify and approve the material&#13;
terms  of  the  1992  Stock  Plan,  including,  without  limitation,  the  share&#13;
limitations  described  below with  respect to Section  162 (m) of the  Internal&#13;
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.&#13;
&#13;
SUMMARY OF THE ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. 1992 STOCK PLAN&#13;
&#13;
         GENERAL.  The  purpose  of the Plan is to  attract  and retain the best&#13;
available  personnel  for  positions  of  substantial  responsibility  with  the&#13;
Company, to provide additional incentive to the employees and consultants of the&#13;
Company and to promote the success of the  Company.  Options and stock  purchase&#13;
rights  may be granted  under the Plan.  Options  granted  under the Plan may be&#13;
either  "incentive  stock  options",  as defined in Section 422 of the  Internal&#13;
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or nonstatutory stock options.&#13;
&#13;
         ADMINISTRATION.  The Plan may generally be  administered  by the Board &#13;
or a Committee  appointed by the Board (as  applicable, the "Administrator").  &#13;
The Administrator may make any determinations deemed necessary or advisable for &#13;
the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
         ELIGIBILITY.  Nonstatutory  stock options and stock purchase rights may&#13;
be granted  under the Plan to employees and  consultants  of the Company and any&#13;
parent or subsidiary of the Company. Incentive stock options may be granted only&#13;
to employees.  The Administrator,  in its discretion,  selects the employees and&#13;
consultants to whom options and stock purchase  rights may be granted,  the time&#13;
or times at which such options and stock purchase  rights shall be granted,  and&#13;
the exercise price and number of shares subject to each such grant.&#13;
&#13;
         LIMITATIONS.   Section   162(m)  of  the  Code  places  limits  on  the&#13;
deductibility  for federal income tax purposes of  compensation  paid to certain&#13;
executive officers of the Company. In order to preserve the Company's ability to&#13;
deduct the compensation income associated with options and stock purchase rights&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -5-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
granted to such persons,  the Plan provides that no employee may be granted,  in&#13;
any fiscal year of the Company,  options and stock  purchase  rights to purchase&#13;
more than 150,000 shares of Common Stock.  Notwithstanding this limit,  however,&#13;
in connection with such individual's  initial employment with the Company, he or&#13;
she may be  granted  options  or stock  purchase  rights  to  purchase  up to an&#13;
additional 150,000 shares of Common Stock.&#13;
&#13;
         TERMS AND  CONDITIONS  OF OPTIONS.  Each option is evidenced by a stock&#13;
option  agreement  between the Company and the  optionee,  and is subject to the&#13;
following terms and conditions:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) EXERCISE PRICE. The Administrator  determines the exercise price of&#13;
options at the time the options are granted.  The exercise price of an incentive&#13;
stock  option may not be less than 100% of the fair  market  value of the Common&#13;
Stock on the date such option is granted; provided,  however, the exercise price&#13;
of an incentive  stock option granted to a 10%  shareholder may not be less than&#13;
110% of the fair  market  value of the Common  Stock on the date such  option is&#13;
granted.  The fair market value of the Common Stock is generally determined with&#13;
reference  to the closing sale price for the Common Stock (or the closing bid if&#13;
no sales were reported) on the date the option is granted.&#13;
&#13;
         (b)  EXERCISE  OF  OPTION;  FORM OF  CONSIDERATION.  The  Administrator&#13;
determines  when  options  become  exercisable,   and  may  in  its  discretion,&#13;
accelerate  the  vesting of any  outstanding  option.  The means of payment  for&#13;
shares issued upon exercise of an option is specified in each option  agreement.&#13;
The Plan  permits  payment to be made by cash,  check,  promissory  note,  other&#13;
shares  of  Common  Stock of the  Company  (with  some  restrictions),  cashless&#13;
exercises,  a reduction in the amount of any Company  liability to the optionee,&#13;
any other form of consideration  permitted by applicable law, or any combination&#13;
thereof.&#13;
&#13;
         (c) TERM OF OPTION.  The term of an  incentive  stock  option may be no&#13;
more than ten (10) years from the date of grant; provided that in the case of an&#13;
incentive stock option granted to a 10% shareholder,  the term of the option may&#13;
be no more  than  five (5)  years  from  the date of  grant.  No  option  may be&#13;
exercised after the expiration of its term.&#13;
&#13;
         (d)  TERMINATION  OF  EMPLOYMENT.   If  an  optionee's   employment  or&#13;
consulting   relationship   terminates  for  any  reason   (including  death  or&#13;
disability),  then all options held by the optionee under the Plan expire on the&#13;
earlier  of (i) the date set  forth  in his or her  notice  of grant or (ii) the&#13;
expiration  date of such option.  The Plan and the option  agreement may provide&#13;
for a longer period of time for the option to be exercised  after the optionee's&#13;
death or  disability  than for other  terminations.  To the extent the option is&#13;
exercisable  at the time of such  termination,  the optionee (or the  optionee's&#13;
estate or the person who acquires the right to exercise the option by bequest or&#13;
inheritance)  may  exercise  all or part of his or her option at any time before&#13;
termination.&#13;
&#13;
         (e)  NONTRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS:  Unless otherwise determined by the&#13;
Administrator, options granted under the Plan are not transferable other than by&#13;
will or the laws of descent and  distribution,  and may be exercised  during the&#13;
optionee's lifetime only by the optionee.&#13;
&#13;
         (f) OTHER  PROVISIONS:  The stock option  agreement  may contain  other&#13;
terms,  provisions  and  conditions  not  inconsistent  with  the Plan as may be&#13;
determined by the Administrator.&#13;
&#13;
         STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS.  In the case of SPRs,  unless the  Administrator&#13;
determines  otherwise,  the Restricted Stock Purchase  Agreement shall grant the&#13;
Company a  repurchase  option  exercisable  upon the  voluntary  or  involuntary&#13;
termination  of the  purchaser's  employment  with the  Company  for any  reason&#13;
(including  death or  disability).  The  purchase  price for Shares  repurchased&#13;
pursuant to the Restricted Stock Purchase  Agreement shall be the original price&#13;
paid by the purchaser and may be paid by &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -6-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
cancellation of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase&#13;
option shall lapse at a rate determined by the Administrator.&#13;
&#13;
         ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION. In the event that the stock&#13;
of the Company changes by reason of any stock split,  reverse stock split, stock&#13;
dividend,  combination,  reclassification or other similar change in the capital&#13;
structure  of  the  Company  effected  without  the  receipt  of  consideration,&#13;
appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number and class of shares of stock&#13;
subject  to the Plan,  the  number  and class of shares of stock  subject to any&#13;
option or stock  purchase  right  outstanding  under the Plan,  and the exercise&#13;
price of any such outstanding option or stock purchase right.&#13;
&#13;
         In the event of a liquidation or dissolution,  any unexercised  options&#13;
or stock purchase  rights will  terminate.  The  Administrator  may, in its sole&#13;
discretion,  provide that each optionee  shall have the right to exercise all of&#13;
the optionee's options and stock purchase rights,  including those not otherwise&#13;
exercisable.&#13;
&#13;
         In connection with any merger, consolidation,  acquisition of assets or&#13;
like occurrence involving the Company, each outstanding option or stock purchase&#13;
right  shall be  assumed or an  equivalent  option or right  substituted  by the&#13;
successor  corporation.  If the  successor  corporation  refuses  to assume  the&#13;
options and stock  purchase  rights or to  substitute  substantially  equivalent&#13;
options and stock purchase rights,  the Administrator  shall have the discretion&#13;
to allow the optionee to exercise the option or stock  purchase  right as to all&#13;
the optioned stock, including shares not otherwise  exercisable.  In such event,&#13;
the  Administrator  shall notify the optionee that the option or stock  purchase&#13;
right is fully  exercisable  for fifteen  (15) days from the date of such notice&#13;
and that the option or stock purchase right  terminates  upon expiration of such&#13;
period.&#13;
&#13;
         AMENDMENT  AND  TERMINATION  OF THE PLAN.  The Board may amend,  alter,&#13;
suspend or  terminate  the Plan,  or any part  thereof,  at any time and for any&#13;
reason. However, the Company shall obtain shareholder approval for any amendment&#13;
to the Plan to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with applicable law.&#13;
No such  action by the Board or  shareholders  may alter or impair any option or&#13;
stock  purchase  right  previously  granted  under the Plan  without the written&#13;
consent of the optionee.  Unless terminated earlier, the Plan shall terminate in&#13;
August 2002.&#13;
&#13;
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES&#13;
&#13;
         INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS.  An optionee who is granted an incentive stock&#13;
option does not  recognize  taxable  income at the time the option is granted or&#13;
upon its exercise,  although the exercise is an adjustment  item for alternative&#13;
minimum tax  purposes and may subject the  optionee to the  alternative  minimum&#13;
tax.  Upon a  disposition  of the shares  more than two years after grant of the&#13;
option and one year after exercise of the option, any gain or loss is treated as&#13;
long-term  capital gain or loss.  Net capital  gains on shares held more than 12&#13;
months may be taxed at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Capital losses are allowed&#13;
in full against  capital gains and up to $3,000  against other income.  If these&#13;
holding periods are not satisfied,  the optionee  recognizes  ordinary income at&#13;
the time of disposition  equal to the difference  between the exercise price and&#13;
the lower of (i) the fair  market  value of the shares at the date of the option&#13;
exercise or (ii) the sale price of the shares.  Any gain or loss  recognized  on&#13;
such a premature  disposition  of the shares in excess of the amount  treated as&#13;
ordinary  income is treated as  long-term  or  short-term  capital gain or loss,&#13;
depending on the holding period. A different rule for measuring  ordinary income&#13;
upon such a premature  disposition may apply if the optionee is also an officer,&#13;
director, or 10% shareholder of the Company. Unless limited by Section 162(m) of&#13;
the Code,  the  Company is  entitled  to a  deduction  in the same amount as the&#13;
ordinary income recognized by the optionee.&#13;
&#13;
         NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS.  An optionee does not recognize any taxable&#13;
income  at the time he or she is  granted  a  nonstatutory  stock  option.  Upon&#13;
exercise,  the optionee  recognizes  taxable  income  &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
generally  measured  by the excess of the then fair  market  value of the shares&#13;
over the exercise  price.  Any taxable income  recognized in connection  with an&#13;
option  exercise by an employee of the Company is subject to tax  withholding by&#13;
the  Company.  Unless  limited by  Section  162(m) of the Code,  the  Company is&#13;
entitled to a deduction in the same amount as the ordinary income  recognized by&#13;
the optionee.  Upon a disposition of such shares by the optionee, any difference&#13;
between  the sale price and the  optionee's  exercise  price,  to the extent not&#13;
recognized  as taxable  income as provided  above,  is treated as  long-term  or&#13;
short-term  capital gain or loss,  depending on the holding period.  Net capital&#13;
gains on shares held more than 12 months may be taxed at a maximum  federal rate&#13;
of 20%.  Capital  losses are  allowed in full  against  capital  gains and up to&#13;
$3,000 against other income.&#13;
&#13;
         STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS. Stock purchase rights will generally be taxed in&#13;
the same manner as  nonstatutory  stock options.  However,  restricted  stock is&#13;
generally  purchased upon the exercise of a stock purchase right. At the time of&#13;
purchase,  restricted  stock is subject to a  "substantial  risk of  forfeiture"&#13;
within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code, because the Company may repurchase&#13;
the stock when the  purchaser  ceases to provide  services to the Company.  As a&#13;
result of this substantial risk of forfeiture,  the purchaser will not recognize&#13;
ordinary income at the time of purchase.  Instead,  the purchaser will recognize&#13;
ordinary  income  on  the  dates  when  the  stock  is no  longer  subject  to a&#13;
substantial  risk of forfeiture  (i.e.,  when the Company's  right of repurchase&#13;
lapses).  The purchaser's  ordinary income is measured as the difference between&#13;
the purchase  price and the fair market value of the stock on the date the stock&#13;
is no longer subject to right of repurchase.&#13;
&#13;
         The  purchaser  may  accelerate  to the  date  of  purchase  his or her&#13;
recognition  of ordinary  income,  if any,  and begin his or her  capital  gains&#13;
holding period by timely filing,  (i.e, within thirty days of the purchase),  an&#13;
election  pursuant to Section  83(b) of the Code.  In such event,  the  ordinary&#13;
income  recognized,  if any, is measured as the difference  between the purchase&#13;
price and the fair market  value of the stock on the date of  purchase,  and the&#13;
capital  gain  holding  period  commences  on such  date.  The  ordinary  income&#13;
recognized by a purchaser who is an employee will be subject to tax  withholding&#13;
by the Company.  Different  rules may apply if the purchaser is also an officer,&#13;
director, or 10% shareholder of the Company.&#13;
&#13;
         THE  FOREGOING  IS ONLY A  SUMMARY  OF THE  EFFECT  OF  FEDERAL  INCOME&#13;
TAXATION UPON OPTIONEES,  HOLDERS OF STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS, AND THE COMPANY WITH&#13;
RESPECT TO THE GRANT AND EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER THE&#13;
PLAN.  IT DOES  NOT  PURPORT  TO BE  COMPLETE,  AND  DOES  NOT  DISCUSS  THE TAX&#13;
CONSEQUENCES  OF THE EMPLOYEE'S OR  CONSULTANT'S  DEATH OR THE PROVISIONS OF THE&#13;
INCOME  TAX LAWS OF ANY  MUNICIPALITY,  STATE OR  FOREIGN  COUNTRY  IN WHICH THE&#13;
EMPLOYEE OR CONSULTANT MAY RESIDE.&#13;

&#13;
             RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS&#13;
&#13;
         The  Board  of  Directors  has  selected   PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,&#13;
independent  accountants,  to audit the financial  statements of the Company for&#13;
the fiscal year ending December 31, 1999. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited&#13;
the   Company's   financial   statements   since  1989.  A   representative   of&#13;
PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP is  expected  to be present at the  meeting and will&#13;
have the  opportunity  to make a  statement,  and is expected to be available to&#13;
respond to appropriate questions.&#13;
&#13;
Required Vote&#13;
&#13;
         The Board of Directors has conditioned its appointment of the Company's&#13;
independent  accountants  upon the receipt of the affirmative vote of a majority&#13;

ownership  on Form 3 and  changes  in  ownership  on  Form 4 or Form 5 with  the&#13;

Forms 5 required for such persons were filed,  the Company  believes that during&#13;

- -------------------------&#13;
(1)   All options in this table are  incentive  stock  options and were  granted&#13;
      under the 1992 Stock  Option Plan and have  exercise  prices  equal to the&#13;
      fair market value on the date of grant.  All such  options  have  ten-year&#13;
      terms and vest over a five-year period at the rate of one-fifth at the end&#13;
      of one year from the date of grant and 1/60th each month thereafter.&#13;
(2)   The Company granted options to purchase 758,000 shares of Common Stock to&#13;
      employees in fiscal 1998.&#13;
(3)   Options may terminate  before their  expiration  upon the  termination  of&#13;
      optionee's status as an employee or consultant, the optionee's death or an&#13;
      acquisition of the Company.&#13;
(4)   Potential realizable value assumes that the stock price increases from the&#13;
      exercise price from the date of grant until the end of the option term (10&#13;
      years) at the  annual  rate  specified  (5% and 10%).  Annual  compounding&#13;
      results in total appreciation of approximately  62.9% (at 5% per year) and&#13;

         REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS&#13;
&#13;
         The Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee")&#13;
consists of directors Monte F. Zweben and Frank H. Robinson,  neither of whom is&#13;
an employee or officer of the Company. The Committee sets policy and administers&#13;
the Company's cash and equity  incentive  programs for the purpose of attracting&#13;
and retaining highly skilled  executives who will promote the Company's business&#13;
goals and build long-term  stockholder  value. The Committee is also responsible&#13;
for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding all&#13;
forms of compensation to be provided to the executive  officers and directors of&#13;
the Company,  including stock  compensation  and loans,  and all bonus and stock&#13;
compensation to all employees.&#13;
&#13;
         To the extent  appropriate,  the Company  intends to take the necessary&#13;
steps to  conform  its  compensation  practices  to comply  with the $1  million&#13;
compensation  deduction cap under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of&#13;
1986, as amended.&#13;
&#13;
COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
         The  policy of the  Committee  is to attract  and retain key  personnel&#13;
through the payment of  competitive  base  salaries and to encourage  and reward&#13;
performance through bonuses and stock ownership.  The Committee's objectives are&#13;
to:&#13;
&#13;
o        ensure that the executive team has clear goals and accountability with &#13;
         respect to corporate performance;&#13;
&#13;
o        establish  pay   opportunities   that  are  competitive   based  on&#13;
         prevailing practices for the industry, the stage of growth, and the&#13;
         labor markets in which the Company operates;&#13;
&#13;
o        independently assess operating results on a regular basis in light of &#13;
         expected Company performance; and&#13;
&#13;
o        align pay incentives with the long-term interests of the Company's &#13;
         stockholders.&#13;
&#13;
ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION&#13;
&#13;
         Compensation  for officers  and key  employees  includes  both cash and&#13;
equity elements.&#13;
&#13;
         Cash compensation  consists of base salary,  which is determined on the&#13;
basis of the level of responsibility,  expertise and experience of the employee,&#13;
and  competitive  conditions  in the industry.  The Committee  believes that the&#13;
salaries of its officers  fall within the software  industry  norm. In addition,&#13;
cash bonuses may be awarded to officers  and other key  employees;  however,  no&#13;
executive officer received a cash bonus in 1998. Compensation of sales personnel&#13;
also includes sales commissions tied to quarterly targets.&#13;
&#13;
         Ownership of the  Company's  Common Stock is a key element of executive&#13;
compensation.  Officers  and other  employees  of the  Company  are  eligible to&#13;
participate  in the 1992 Stock Plan (the  "Option  Plan") and the 1995  Employee&#13;
Stock  Purchase  Plan (the  "Purchase  Plan"),  which were adopted  prior to the&#13;
Company's  initial public offering in November 1995. The Option Plan permits the&#13;
Board of Directors or the  Committee to grant stock options to employees on such&#13;
terms as the Board or the  Committee may  determine.  The Committee has the sole&#13;
authority  to grant stock  options to  executive  officers of the Company and is&#13;
currently administering stock option grants to all employees. In determining the&#13;
size of a stock  option  grant to a new  officer  or  other  key  employee,  the&#13;
Committee takes&#13;
&#13;

&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
into account equity participation by comparable employees within the Company,&#13;
external  competitive  circumstances  and other relevant  factors. Additional  &#13;
options may be granted to current  employees  to reward  exceptional performance&#13;
or to provide additional  unvested equity  incentives. The Purchase Plan permits&#13;
employees to acquire Common Stock of the Company  through  payroll deductions &#13;
and promotes broad-based equity participation throughout the Company. The  &#13;
Committee  believes  that  such  stock  plans  align the  interests  of the&#13;
employees with the long-term interests of the stockholders.&#13;
&#13;
         The Company also maintains a 401(k) Plan to provide retirement benefits&#13;
through  tax  deferred  salary  deductions  for all its  employees.  The Company&#13;
matches  up to  50%  of an  employee's  contribution,  not to  exceed  $500  per&#13;
employee.&#13;
&#13;
1998 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION&#13;
&#13;
         Executive   compensation  for  1998  included  base  salary,  cash  and&#13;
equity-based incentive compensation and, in the case of sales executives,  sales&#13;
commissions.  Cash incentive  compensation is designed to motivate executives to&#13;
attain corporate, business unit and individual goals. The Company's policy is to&#13;
have a significant portion of an executive's total compensation at risk based on&#13;
the Company's  overall  performance.  Since 1996,  the Company has  maintained a&#13;
profit  sharing  plan  for  its  employees,   and  certain  executive   officers&#13;
participated in this program in 1998. Executive officers,  like other employees,&#13;
were eligible for option grants under the Option Plan.&#13;
&#13;
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION&#13;
&#13;
         Compensation for the Chief Executive Officer is determined by a process&#13;
similar to that  discussed  above for executive  officers.  The Chief  Executive&#13;
Officer's  target  base pay level has been  analyzed  using data for  comparable&#13;
software  companies.  Ms.  DiMarco  receives no other material  compensation  or&#13;
benefits not provided to all executive officers.&#13;
&#13;
         The Committee has considered the potential  impact of Section 162(m) of&#13;
the  Internal   Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended,   which  limits  the  tax&#13;
deductibility of cash compensation paid to individual  executive  officers to $1&#13;
million per officer. The cash compensation to be paid to the Company's executive&#13;
officers  in fiscal  1996 is not  expected  to exceed the $1  million  limit per&#13;
individual officer.&#13;

to be added on December 31 of the years 1999, 2000 and 2001 equal to the lesser &#13;
of (i) 500,000 shares, (ii) 3% of the  outstanding  shares as of December  31 of&#13;
each year,  or (iii) an amount determined  by the  Board.  The  shares  may be  &#13;
authorized,  but  unissued,  or reacquired Common Stock.&#13;
&#13;
         If an Option or Stock  Purchase Right  expires,  becomes  unexercisable&#13;
without having been  exercised in full, or is surrendered  pursuant to an option&#13;
exchange program approved by the Administrator, the unpurchased Shares that were&#13;
subject  thereto shall become  available for future grant or sale under the Plan&#13;
(unless the Plan has  terminated).  Shares that have  actually been issued under&#13;
the Plan,  whether upon exercise of an Option or Right, shall not be returned to&#13;
the Plan and shall not become available for future  distribution under the Plan,&#13;
except  that if Shares of  Restricted  Stock are  repurchased  by the Company at&#13;
their original purchase price, and the original purchaser of such Shares did not&#13;
receive any  benefits of  ownership  of such  Shares,  such Shares  shall become&#13;
available  for  future  grant  under the Plan.  For  purposes  of the  preceding&#13;
sentence, voting rights shall not be considered a benefit of Share ownership. &#13;
&#13;
4. Administration of the Plan. &#13;
&#13;
     (a) Procedure. &#13;
&#13;
          (i) Multiple  Administrative Bodies. If permitted by Rule 16b-3,  the&#13;
              Plan may be  administered  by different bodies with respect to &#13;
              Directors, Officers who are not Directors, and Employees who are&#13;
              neither Directors nor Officers.  &#13;
&#13;
         (ii) Administration  With Respect to Directors and Officers Subject to &#13;
              Section 16(b).  With respect to Option or Stock Purchase Right &#13;
              grants made to  Employees  who are also  Officers or Directors  &#13;
              subject to Section  16(b) of the Exchange  Act, the Plan shall be &#13;
              administered  by (A) the Board, if the Board may administer the &#13;
              Plan in a manner complying with the rules under  Rule 16b-3  &#13;
              relating  to the  disinterested  administration  of  employee&#13;
              benefit plans under &#13;
&#13;
                                      -3-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
              which Section 16(b) exempt  discretionary  grants and awards of &#13;
              equity securities are to be made, or (B) a committee  designated &#13;
              by the Board to administer the Plan,  which committee shall be &#13;
              constituted to comply with the rules under Rule 16b-3 relating to &#13;
              the disinterested  administration of employee benefit plans under &#13;
              which Section 16(b) exempt  discretionary  grants and awards of &#13;
              equity  securities  are to be made.  Once  appointed,  such  &#13;
              Committee  shall continue to serve in its  designated  capacity &#13;
              until  otherwise  directed by the Board.  From time to time the &#13;
              Board may increase the size of the  Committee  and appoint  &#13;
              additional  members,   remove  members  (with  or  without  cause)&#13;
              and substitute new members,  fill vacancies (however caused), and &#13;
              remove all members of the Committee and thereafter  directly &#13;
              administer the Plan, all to the extent permitted  by  the  rules  &#13;
              under  Rule  16b-3  relating  to  the   disinterested &#13;
              administration  of  employee  benefit  plans under which  Section&#13;
              16(b)  exempt discretionary  grants  and  awards of equity  &#13;
              securities  are to be made.  &#13;
&#13;
        (iii) Administration  With Respect to Other  Persons.  With respect to &#13;
              Option or Stock Purchase Right grants made to Employees or &#13;
              Consultants who are neither Directors nor Officers of the Company,&#13;
              the Plan shall be administered by (A) the Board or (B) a committee&#13;
              designated by the Board, which committee shall be constituted to&#13;
              satisfy  Applicable  Laws.  Once  appointed,  such Committee shall&#13;
              serve in its designated  capacity  until  otherwise  directed  by &#13;
              the  Board.  The  Board may increase  the size of the  Committee  &#13;
              and  appoint  additional  members,  remove members  (with or &#13;
              without  cause) and  substitute  new members,  fill  vacancies &#13;
              (however  caused),  and  remove  all  members of the  Committee  &#13;
              and  thereafter directly  administer the Plan, all to the extent  &#13;
              permitted by Applicable  Laws. &#13;
&#13;
     (b) Powers of the  Administrator.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, &#13;
         and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties &#13;
         delegated by the Board to  such  Committee,   the  Administrator  shall&#13;
         have  the  authority,  in  its discretion:  &#13;
&#13;
          (i) to  determine  the Fair Market  Value of the Common  Stock,  in&#13;
              accordance  with Section 2(l) of the Plan;  &#13;
 &#13;
         (ii) to select the Consultants  and Employees to whom Options and Stock&#13;
              Purchase  Rights may be granted  hereunder; &#13;
&#13;
        (iii) to determine whether and to what extent Options and Stock Purchase&#13;
              Rights or any combination thereof, are granted hereunder;  &#13;
&#13;
         (iv) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by&#13;
              each Option and Stock  Purchase Right granted  hereunder;  &#13;
&#13;
          (v) to approve  forms of agreement  for use under the Plan;&#13;
     &#13;
         (vi) to determine the terms and conditions,  not inconsistent  with the&#13;
              terms of the Plan, of any award granted hereunder. Such terms and &#13;
              conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price,  &#13;
              the time or times when Options or Stock Purchase Rights may be &#13;
              exercised  (which may be based on performance  criteria), any &#13;
              vesting  acceleration  or  waiver  of  forfeiture  restrictions,  &#13;
              and  any restriction  or limitation  regarding any Option or Stock&#13;
              Purchase Right or the&#13;
&#13;
                                      -4-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              shares of Common Stock relating  thereto,  &#13;
              based in each case on such factors as the Administrator,  in its &#13;
              sole discretion, shall determine; &#13;
&#13;
        (vii) to reduce the exercise  price of any Option or Stock  Purchase  &#13;
              Right to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market &#13;
              Value of the Common Stock covered by such Option or Stock Purchase&#13;
              Right shall have declined since the date the Option or Stock &#13;
              Purchase  Right was granted;  &#13;
&#13;
       (viii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards granted&#13;
              pursuant  to the Plan;  &#13;
&#13;
         (ix) to  prescribe,  amend and rescind  rules and regulations  relating&#13;
              to the  Plan,  including  rules  and regulations relating to &#13;
              sub-plans  established for the purpose of qualifying for preferred&#13;
              tax  treatment  under  foreign tax laws;  &#13;
&#13;
          (x) to modify or amend each Option or Stock Purchase Right (subject to&#13;
              Section 14(b) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority &#13;
              to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Options &#13;
              longer than is otherwise  provided for in the Plan; &#13;
&#13;
         (xi) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any &#13;
              instrument required to effect the  grant of an  Option  or Stock  &#13;
              Purchase  Right  previously  granted  by the Administrator;  &#13;
&#13;
        (xii) to  determine  the terms and  restrictions  applicable  to Options&#13;
              and Stock Purchase Rights and any Restricted  Stock;  and &#13;
&#13;
       (xiii) to make all other  determinations  deemed necessary or advisable &#13;
              for  administering  the Plan. &#13;
&#13;
     (c) Effect of Administrator's Decision. All decisions,  determinations and&#13;
         interpretations of the Administrator shall be final and binding on all &#13;
         Optionees and any other holders of any Options or Stock Purchase &#13;
         Rights.  &#13;
&#13;
5.  Eligibility.&#13;
&#13;
     (a)  Nonstatutory  Stock  Options  and Stock  Purchase  Rights may be &#13;
          granted to Employees  and  Consultants.  Incentive  Stock Options  may&#13;
          be granted  only to Employees.  An Employee or  Consultant  who has &#13;
          been  granted an Option or Stock Purchase Right may, if he or she is &#13;
          otherwise  eligible,  be granted  additional Options or Stock Purchase&#13;
          Rights.  &#13;
&#13;
     (b) Each Option shall be  designated in the written option  agreement as &#13;
         either an Incentive  Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. &#13;
         However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the&#13;
         aggregate  Fair  Market  Value of the Shares  with  respect  to  which &#13;
         Options designated as Incentive  Stock Options are exercisable for the &#13;
         first time by any Optionee  &#13;
&#13;
                                      -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company or any Parent&#13;
         or  Subsidiary)  exceeds  $100,000,  such  excess  Options  shall be  &#13;
         treated as Nonstatutory  Stock Options.  &#13;
&#13;
     (c) For purposes of Section 5(b),  Incentive Stock Options shall be taken&#13;
         into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair  &#13;
         Market  Value of the  Shares  shall be  determined  as of the time the&#13;
         Option with  respect to such  Shares is  granted.  &#13;
&#13;
     (d) The Plan shall not confer upon any  Optionee any right with  respect to&#13;
         continuation  of  employment  or consulting relationship with the &#13;
         Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with his or her right or the&#13;
         Company's  right to terminate  his or her  employment or consulting &#13;
         relationship at any time,  with or without cause.  &#13;
 &#13;
     (e) The following limitations  shall  apply to grants of  Options  and  &#13;
         Stock  Purchase  Rights to Employees:  &#13;
&#13;
          (i) No Employee shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the Company,&#13;
              Options and Stock Purchase Rights to purchase more than 150,000 &#13;
              Shares.  &#13;
&#13;
         (ii) In connection  with his or her  initial  employment,  an  Employee&#13;
              may be  granted Options and Stock Purchase Rights to purchase up &#13;
              to an additional 150,000 Shares which shall not count against the &#13;
              limit set forth in subsection (i) above. &#13;
&#13;
        (iii) The foregoing  limitations shall be adjusted  proportionately in &#13;
              connection with any change in the Company's  capitalization  as&#13;
              described in Section 12. &#13;
&#13;
         (iv) If an Option or Stock  Purchase  Right is  cancelled in the same&#13;
              fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted  (other than in&#13;
              connection  with a  transaction described in Section 12), the &#13;
              cancelled  Option or Stock  Purchase Right will be counted against&#13;
              the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this&#13;
              purpose,  if the exercise price of an Option or Stock Purchase &#13;
              Right is reduced, the  transaction  will be  treated  as a  &#13;
              cancellation  of the  Option or Stock Purchase Right and the grant&#13;
              of a new Option or Stock Purchase Right. &#13;
&#13;
6. Term of Plan. The Plan shall become  effective upon the earlier to occur&#13;
of its adoption by the Board of Directors or its approval by the stockholders of&#13;
the Company as described in Section 18 of the Plan. It shall  continue in effect&#13;
for a term of ten (10) years unless  sooner  terminated  under Section 14 of the&#13;
Plan. &#13;
&#13;
7. Term of Option. The term of each Option shall be the term stated in the&#13;
Option  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that the term shall be no more than ten&#13;
(10) years from the date of grant thereof.  However, in the case of an Incentive&#13;
Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns&#13;
stock  representing  more  than ten  percent  (10%) of the  voting  power of all&#13;
classes of stock of the  Company or any Parent or  Subsidiary,  the term of such&#13;
Option  shall be five (5) years from the date of grant  thereof or such  shorter&#13;
term as may be provided in the Option  Agreement. &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -6-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
8. Option  Exercise  Price and  Consideration.  &#13;
&#13;
     (a) The per Share  exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to &#13;
         the exercise of an Option shall be such price as is  determined by the &#13;
         Administrator,  but shall be subject to the following:  &#13;
&#13;
          (i) In the case of an  Incentive  Stock  Option  &#13;
&#13;
               (1)  granted  to an Employee  who, at the time of the grant of &#13;
                    such  Incentive  Stock  Option,  owns stock  representing &#13;
                    more  than ten  percent  (10%) of the  voting  power of all&#13;
                    classes  of stock of the  Company  or any  Parent or  &#13;
                    Subsidiary,  the per Share exercise  price shall be no less &#13;
                    than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of &#13;
                    grant.  &#13;
&#13;
               (2)  granted to any other  Employee,  the per Share  exercise&#13;
                    price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market  Value &#13;
                    per Share on the date of  grant.  &#13;
&#13;
         (ii) In the  case of a  Nonstatutory  Stock  Option,  the per  Share&#13;
              exercise  price  shall  be  determined  by  the   Administrator.  &#13;
     (b)  Form  of Consideration.   The  Administrator  shall  determine  the  &#13;
          acceptable  form  of consideration for exercising an Option, including&#13;
          the method of payment. In the case of an  Incentive  Stock  Option,  &#13;
          the  Administrator  shall  determine  the acceptable form of &#13;
          consideration at the time of grant.  Such  consideration  may consist &#13;
          entirely of: &#13;
 &#13;
          (i) cash; &#13;
     &#13;
         (ii) check;  &#13;
&#13;
        (iii)  promissory  note; &#13;
&#13;
         (iv) other Shares which (A)in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise&#13;
              of an option, have been owned by the  Optionee  for more than six &#13;
              months on the date of  surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value&#13;
              on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise  price of&#13;
              the Shares as to which said Option  shall be  exercised;  &#13;
&#13;
          (v) delivery  of a  properly  executed  exercise notice together  with&#13;
              such  other documentation as the Administrator and the broker, if &#13;
              applicable,  shall require to effect an exercise  of the Option &#13;
              and  delivery to the Company of the sale or loan proceeds required&#13;
              to pay the exercise price; &#13;
&#13;
         (vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the &#13;
              Optionee,  including any liability  attributable to the Optionee's&#13;
              participation in any Company-sponsored  deferred compensation&#13;
              program  or  arrangement;  &#13;
 &#13;
        (vii) any  combination  of the  foregoing  methods of payment;  or &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -7-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
       (viii)  such other  consideration  and  method of  payment  for the&#13;
               issuance of Shares to the extent  permitted by  Applicable  Laws.&#13;
&#13;
9. Exercise of Option. &#13;
&#13;
     (a) Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder.  Any Option granted&#13;
         hereunder  shall be  exercisable  at such  times and under  such &#13;
         conditions  as determined by the Administrator,  including performance &#13;
         criteria with respect to the Company and/or the Optionee,  and as shall&#13;
         be permissible under the terms of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
      An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.&#13;
&#13;
      An Option shall be deemed to be exercised  when written  notice of such&#13;
exercise  has been  given to the  Company  in  accordance  with the terms of the&#13;
Option by the person  entitled to exercise  the Option and full  payment for the&#13;
Shares with  respect to which the Option is exercised  has been  received by the&#13;
Company.  Full payment may, as authorized by the  Administrator,  consist of any&#13;
consideration  and method of payment  allowable  under Section 8(b) of the Plan.&#13;
Until the issuance (as  evidenced by the  appropriate  entry on the books of the&#13;
Company or of a duly  authorized  transfer  agent of the  Company)  of the stock&#13;
certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any&#13;
other rights as a  stockholder  shall exist with respect to the Optioned  Stock,&#13;
notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to&#13;
be issued)  such stock  certificate  promptly  upon  exercise of the Option.  No&#13;
adjustment  will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date&#13;
is prior to the date the stock  certificate  is issued,  except as  provided  in&#13;
Section 12 of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
      Exercise of an Option in any manner  shall  result in a decrease in the&#13;
number of Shares which  thereafter  may be  available,  both for purposes of the&#13;
Plan and for sale  under  the  Option,  by the  number of Shares as to which the&#13;
Option is exercised.  &#13;
&#13;
     (b) Termination of Employment or Consulting  Relationship. Upon termination&#13;
         of  an  Optionee's   Continuous Status  as  an  Employee or Consultant,&#13;
         other than upon the Optionee's death or Disability, the Optionee may&#13;
         exercise his or her Option,  but only within such period of time as is &#13;
         specified in the Notice of Grant, and only to the extent that the &#13;
         Optionee was entitled to exercise  it at the  date  of  termination  &#13;
         (but  in no  event  later  than  the expiration  of the term of such &#13;
         Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant).  In the absence of a &#13;
         specified time in the Notice of Grant,  the Option shall remain&#13;
         exercisable for three (3) months  following the Optionee's termination.&#13;
         In the case of an Incentive  Stock Option,  such period of time for &#13;
         exercise  shall not exceed  three  (3)  months  from the  date of  &#13;
         termination.  If,  on the date of termination,  the  Optionee is not &#13;
         entitled to exercise  the  Optionee's  entire Option,  the Shares  &#13;
         covered by the  unexercisable  portion of the Option  shall revert to &#13;
         the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or&#13;
         her Option  within the time  specified  by the  Administrator,  the &#13;
         Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall &#13;
         revert to the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
      Notwithstanding  the  above,  in the event of an  Optionee's  change in&#13;
status from  Consultant to Employee or Employee to  Consultant,  the  Optionee's&#13;
Continuous Status as an Employee or &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -8-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Consultant shall not automatically terminate solely  as a result  of such change&#13;
in  status.  However,  in such  event,  an Incentive  Stock  Option  held by the&#13;
Optionee  shall cease to be treated as an Incentive  Stock Option and shall be &#13;
treated for tax purposes as a  Nonstatutory Stock  Option  three  months and one&#13;
day  following  such change of status.  &#13;
&#13;
     (c) Disability of Optionee.  In the event that an Optionee's Continuous &#13;
         Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates as a result of the&#13;
         Optionee's Disability,  the Optionee may  exercise  his or her Option &#13;
         at any time within twelve (12)months from the date of such termination,&#13;
         but only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it at&#13;
         the date of such  termination  (but in no event later than the  &#13;
         expiration  of the term of such  Option as set forth in the  Notice of&#13;
         Grant). If, at the date of termination, the Optionee is not entitled to&#13;
         exercise his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the&#13;
         unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after&#13;
         termination,  the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within&#13;
         the time  specified  herein,  the Option shall terminate,  and the &#13;
         Shares  covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan. &#13;
&#13;
     (d) Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of an Optionee,  the &#13;
         Option may be exercised at any time within twelve (12) months following&#13;
         the date of death (but in no event later than the expiration of the&#13;
         term of such Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant),  by the &#13;
         Optionee's  estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise &#13;
         the Option by bequest or  inheritance,  but only to the extent that the&#13;
         Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at the date of death.  If,&#13;
         at the time of death,  the  Optionee  was not  entitled to  exercise  &#13;
         his or her entire  Option,  the Shares covered by the  unexercisable  &#13;
         portion of the Option shall immediately  revert to the Plan. If, after &#13;
         death, the Optionee's estate or a person who acquired the right to &#13;
         exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance does not exercise the &#13;
         Option within the time specified herein,  the Option shall terminate,  &#13;
         and the Shares  covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan. &#13;
&#13;
     (e) Buyout  Provisions.  The  Administrator  may at any time  offer to buy &#13;
         out for a payment in cash or Shares, an Option previously granted,&#13;
         based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish&#13;
         and communicate to the Optionee at the time that  such  offer  is made.&#13;
     &#13;
     (f) Rule  16b-3.  Options  granted  to individuals subject to Section 16 of&#13;
         the Exchange Act ("Insiders")  must comply with the applicable  &#13;
         provisions of Rule 16b-3 and shall contain such  additional conditions &#13;
         or  restrictions  as may be required  thereunder  to qualify for the&#13;
         maximum  exemption  from  Section 16 of the  Exchange  Act with  espect&#13;
         to Plan transactions.  &#13;
&#13;
10.  Non-Transferability  of Options.  The Option may not be sold, pledged,&#13;
assigned, hypothecated,  transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by&#13;
will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised,  during the&#13;
lifetime of the Optionee,  only by the Optionee.  &#13;
&#13;
11. Stock Purchase Rights. &#13;
&#13;
     (a) Rights to  Purchase.  Stock  Purchase  Rights  may be issued  either  &#13;
         alone,  in addition to, or in tandem with other awards  granted  under&#13;
         the Plan and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the &#13;
         Administrator determines that it will offer  Stock  Purchase  Rights  &#13;
         under the Plan,  it shall  advise the offeree in writing of the  terms,&#13;
         conditions  and  restrictions  related  to  the  offer, &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -9-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
         including  the number of Shares that such person  shall be entitled to &#13;
         purchase, the price to be paid and the time  within  which such  person&#13;
         must  accept such offer,  which shall in no event exceed ninety (90) &#13;
         days from the date upon which the Administrator  made the determination&#13;
         to grant the Stock Purchase Right. The offer shall be accepted by &#13;
         execution of a purchase  agreement  (the  "Restricted Stock Purchase  &#13;
         Agreement") in the form determined by the Administrator.  Shares&#13;
         purchased  pursuant to the grant of a Stock  Purchase Right shall be &#13;
         referred to herein as "Restricted  Stock". &#13;
&#13;
     (b) Repurchase  Option. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise,  the&#13;
         Restricted Stock Purchase  Agreement shall grant the Company a &#13;
         repurchase  option exercisable  upon the  voluntary  or  involuntary &#13;
         termination  of the purchaser's  employment  with the  Company  for any&#13;
         reason (including death or  Disability). The purchase  price for Shares&#13;
         repurchased pursuant to the Restricted Stock Purchase  Agreement shall &#13;
         be the original price paid by the purchaser and may be paid by&#13;
         cancellation of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the Company.  The &#13;
         repurchase option shall lapse at such rate as the Administrator may &#13;
         determine. &#13;
&#13;
     (c) Other Provisions. The Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall contain&#13;
         such  other  terms,  provisions  and  conditions  not inconsistent with&#13;
         the Plan as may be determined by the Administrator in its sole&#13;
         discretion.  In addition, the provisions of Restricted Stock purchase &#13;
         agreements need  not  be  the  same  with respect  to  each  purchaser.&#13;
&#13;
     (d)  Rights  as a Stockholder.  Once the Stock Purchase Right is exercised,&#13;
          the purchaser  shall have the rights equivalent to those of a &#13;
          stockholder, and shall be a stockholder when his or her  purchase  is &#13;
          entered  upon the  records of the duly  authorized transfer  agent of &#13;
          the  Company.  No  adjustment  will be made for a dividend or other  &#13;
          right for which the record date is prior to the date the Stock &#13;
          Purchase Right is  exercised,  except as  provided  in Section  12 of &#13;
          the Plan.  &#13;
&#13;
     (e) Rule 16b-3.  Stock  Purchase  Rights  granted to  Insiders,  and Shares&#13;
         purchased by Insiders  in  connection  with Stock  Purchase  Rights, &#13;
         shall be subject to any restrictions  applicable  thereto in compliance&#13;
         with Rule 16b-3. An Insider may only purchase Shares  pursuant to the &#13;
         grant of a Stock Purchase  Right,  and may only sell  Shares  purchased&#13;
         pursuant to the grant of a Stock  Purchase  Right, during such time or &#13;
         times as are permitted by Rule 16b-3.  &#13;
&#13;
12.  Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution or Merger. &#13;
&#13;
     (a) Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by the &#13;
         stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common  Stock  &#13;
         covered by each  outstanding  Option or Stock  Purchase Right,  and the&#13;
         number of shares of Common Stock which have been  authorized for&#13;
         issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options or Stock Purchase &#13;
         Rights have yet been granted or which have been  returned to the Plan &#13;
         upon  cancellation or expiration of an Option or Stock Purchase  Right,&#13;
         as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each such &#13;
         outstanding Option or Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately  &#13;
         adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of&#13;
         Common Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock  &#13;
         dividend,  combination or  reclassification  of the Common Stock,  or &#13;
         any other  increase  or  decrease  in the  number of issued  shares of &#13;
         Common  Stock effected  without receipt of consideration  by the&#13;
         Company;  provided,  however, that conversion of any convertible &#13;
         securities of the Company shall not &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -10-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration". &#13;
         Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination&#13;
         in that  respect  shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Except as&#13;
         expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of &#13;
         stock of any class, or securities  convertible  into shares of stock of&#13;
         any class,  shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be &#13;
         made with  respect  to, the  number or price of shares of Common  Stock&#13;
         subject to an Option or Stock Purchase Right. &#13;
&#13;
     (b) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed  dissolution  &#13;
         or  liquidation  of the Company,  to the extent that an Option or Stock&#13;
         Purchase Right has not been previously exercised, it will terminate &#13;
         immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. The &#13;
         Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, &#13;
         declare that any Option or Stock  Purchase Right shall  terminate as of&#13;
         a date fixed by the Board and give each  Optionee  the right to  &#13;
         exercise  his or her  Option or Stock  Purchase  Right as to all or any&#13;
         part of the  Optioned  Stock,  including Shares as to which the Option &#13;
         or Stock  Purchase  Right would not  otherwise  be exercisable.  &#13;
&#13;
     (c) Merger or Asset Sale.  In the event of a merger of the Company with or &#13;
         into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the &#13;
         assets of the  Company,  each  outstanding  Option and Stock  Purchase &#13;
         Right shall be assumed  or  an  equivalent   option  or  right  &#13;
         substituted  by  the  successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary &#13;
         of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor   &#13;
         corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or Stock &#13;
         Purchase  Right,  Administrator  shall have the  discretion  to allow &#13;
         the Optionee  to  exercise  the  Option  or  Stock  Purchase  Right as &#13;
         to all of the Optioned  Stock,  including  Shares  as to  which  it &#13;
         would  not  otherwise  be exercisable.  If an Option or Stock  Purchase&#13;
         Right is  exercisable  in lieu of assumption  or  substitution  in the &#13;
         event of a merger or sale of  assets,  the Administrator  shall notify &#13;
         the Optionee that the Option or Stock Purchase Right shall be fully  &#13;
         exercisable  for a period of fifteen  (15) days from the date of such &#13;
         notice,  and the Option or Stock  Purchase  Right shall  terminate upon&#13;
         the expiration  of such period.  For the purposes of this  paragraph, &#13;
         the Option or Stock  Purchase  Right shall be considered  assumed if, &#13;
         following the merger or sale of assets,  the option or right  confers  &#13;
         the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Optioned  Stock &#13;
         subject to the Option or Stock  Purchase Right immediately prior to the&#13;
         merger or sale of assets,  the  consideration  (whether stock,  cash, &#13;
         or other securities or property) received in the merger or sale of &#13;
         assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the  effective&#13;
         date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of &#13;
         consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a &#13;
         majority of the outstanding Shares); provided,  however, that if such &#13;
         consideration received in the merger or sale of assets was not solely &#13;
         common stock of the successor  corporation  or its Parent, the &#13;
         Administrator  may, with the consent of the successor  corporation,  &#13;
         provide for the  consideration  to be received  upon the exercise of &#13;
         the Option or Stock Purchase Right,  for each Share of Optioned Stock &#13;
         subject to the Option or Stock Purchase  Right,  to be solely common &#13;
         stock of the successor  corporation or its Parent  equal in fair market&#13;
         value to the per share  consideration  received by holders of Common &#13;
         Stock in the merger or sale of assets.  &#13;
&#13;
13. Date of Grant. The date of grant of an Option or Stock Purchase Right shall,&#13;
for all purposes, be the date on which the Administrator makes the determination&#13;
granting such Option or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -11-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Stock  Purchase   Right,  or  such  other  date  as  is determined  by  the &#13;
Administrator.  Notice of the  determination  shall be given to each Employee or&#13;
Consultant  to whom an Option or Stock  Purchase  Right is so granted  within a &#13;
reasonable time after the date of such grant.  &#13;
&#13;
14. Amendment and Termination of the Plan. &#13;
&#13;
     (a) Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend, alter, &#13;
         suspend or  discontinue  the Plan, but no amendment,  alteration,  &#13;
         suspension or discontinuation  shall be made which would  impair  the &#13;
         rights of any  Optionee under any grant theretofore made without his or&#13;
         her consent. In addition, to the extent  necessary  and  desirable to &#13;
         comply with Section 422 of the Code (or any other  applicable  law or  &#13;
         regulation),  the Company  shall  obtain  stockholder approval  of any&#13;
         Plan  amendment  in  such a  manner and to such a  degree  as required.&#13;
&#13;
     (b) Effect  of  Amendment  or  Termination.  Any such  amendment  or&#13;
         termination  of the Plan  shall not  affect  Options  already  granted &#13;
         and such Options  shall  remain  in full  force  and  effect as if this&#13;
         Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed &#13;
         otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator, which agreement &#13;
         must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and properly on behalf of&#13;
         the Company.  &#13;
&#13;
15. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares  shall not be issued  pursuant to&#13;
the  exercise  of an Option  unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance&#13;
and  delivery of such Shares  pursuant thereto  shall comply with all relevant  &#13;
provisions of law,  including,  without limitation,  the Securities Act of 1933,&#13;
as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder,&#13;
and the  requirements  of any  stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be &#13;
listed,  and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company&#13;
with respect to such compliance.&#13;
&#13;
    As a condition  to the  exercise of an Option,  the Company may require the &#13;
person  exercising  such Option to represent  and warrant at the time of any&#13;
such  exercise  that the  Shares are being  purchased  only for  investment  and&#13;
without  any  present  intention  to sell or  distribute  such Shares if, in the&#13;
opinion of counsel for the Company,  such a representation is required by any of&#13;
the  aforementioned  relevant  provisions of law. &#13;
&#13;
16. Reservation of Shares. The Company,  during  the term of this  Plan,  will&#13;
at all  times  reserve  and keep available  such  number  of  Shares  as  shall &#13;
be  sufficient  to  satisfy  the requirements of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
    The inability of the Company to obtain  authority  from any  regulatory body&#13;
having jurisdiction,  which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be &#13;
necessary  to the lawful  issuance  and sale of any Shares  hereunder,  shall&#13;
relieve the Company of any  liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell&#13;
such Shares as to which such requisite  authority  shall not have been obtained.&#13;
&#13;
17. Agreements.  Options and Stock Purchase Rights shall be evidenced by written&#13;
agreements  in such form as the  Administrator  shall approve from time to time.&#13;
Such agreements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -12-&#13;
&#13;
may contain such other terms and conditions, including rights of repurchase and &#13;
rights of first  refusal,  as the  Administrator  may in its sole discretion &#13;
deem appropriate.  &#13;
&#13;
18. Stockholder Approval.  Continuance of the Plan shall be subject to approval &#13;
by the  stockholders  of the Company  within twelve (12)  months before or after&#13;
the date the Plan is  adopted.  Such  stockholder approval shall be obtained in &#13;
the degree and manner  required  under  applicable state and federal law.&#13;
&#13;

     1. Grant of Option.  The Plan Administrator of the Company hereby grants to&#13;
the Optionee  named in the Notice of Grant  attached as Part I of this Agreement&#13;
(the  "Optionee") an option (the "Option") to purchase the number of Shares,  as&#13;
set forth in the Notice of Grant,  at the exercise  price per share set forth in&#13;

Plan and the  terms  and  conditions  of this  Option  Agreement,  the terms and&#13;
conditions of the Plan shall prevail.&#13;
&#13;
     If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive  Stock Option ("ISO"),&#13;
this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive  Stock  Option under  Section&#13;

it shall be treated as a  Nonstatutory  Stock  Option  ("NSO").  &#13;

Optionee's  death,  Disability or other  termination  of Optionee's employment  &#13;
or  consulting  relationship,  the  exercisability  of the Option is governed by&#13;
the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. &#13;
&#13;
          (b) Method of  Exercise. This Option is exercisable by delivery  of an&#13;
exercise  notice,  in the form  attached as Exhibit A (the  "Exercise  Notice"),&#13;
which shall state the election to exercise  the Option,  the number of Shares in&#13;
respect of which the Option is being  exercised (the  "Exercised  Shares"),  and&#13;
such other  representations  and  agreements  as may be  required by the Company&#13;
pursuant to the provisions of the Plan.  The Exercise  Notice shall be signed by&#13;
the  Optionee  and shall be  delivered  in person  or by  certified  mail to the&#13;
Secretary of the Company. The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of&#13;
the aggregate  Exercise Price as to all Exercised  Shares.  This Option shall be&#13;
deemed to be  exercised  upon  receipt by the  Company  of such  fully  executed&#13;
Exercise Notice accompanied by such aggregate Exercise Price.&#13;
&#13;
     No Shares shall be issued  pursuant to the  exercise of this Option  unless&#13;

&#13;
     3. Method of Payment.  Payment of the aggregate  Exercise Price shall be by&#13;
any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionee:&#13;
&#13;
          (a) cash;  &#13;
&#13;
          (b) check;  &#13;
&#13;
          (c)  delivery  of a  properly  executed  exercise  notice together &#13;
with such other  documentation as the  Administrator and the broker, if&#13;
applicable,  shall  require to effect an exercise of the Option and  delivery to&#13;
the Company of the sale or loan proceeds  required to pay the exercise price; or&#13;
&#13;
          (d)  surrender  of other Shares  which (i) in the case of Shares &#13;
acquired  upon exercise  of an option,  have been owned by the  Optionee  for &#13;
more than six (6)months on the date of  surrender,  and (ii) have a Fair Market &#13;
Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate  Exercise Price of the &#13;
Exercised  Shares. &#13;
&#13;
     4. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any&#13;
manner  otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may&#13;
be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by the Optionee.  The terms of&#13;
the  Plan  and this  Option  Agreement  shall  be  binding  upon the  executors,&#13;
administrators,  heirs,  successors  and  assigns  of the  Optionee.  &#13;
&#13;
     5. Term of Option.  This Option may be  exercised  only within the term set&#13;
out in the  Notice  of  Grant,  and may be  exercised  during  such term only in&#13;
accordance  with  the  Plan  and the  terms  of this  Option  Agreement.  &#13;
&#13;
     6.  Tax  Consequences.  Some of the  federal  and  state  tax  consequences&#13;
relating to this  Option,  as of the date of this  Option,  are set forth below.&#13;
THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY  INCOMPLETE,  AND THE TAX LAWS AND  REGULATIONS  ARE&#13;
SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE  EXERCISING&#13;
THIS  OPTION  OR  DISPOSING  OF THE  SHARES.  &#13;
&#13;
          (a)  Exercising  the  Option.  &#13;
&#13;
               (i) Nonstatutory Stock Option. The Optionee may incur regular &#13;
federal income tax and state income tax liability  upon exercise of a NSO. The &#13;
Optionee will be treated as having  received  compensation  income (taxable at &#13;
ordinary income tax rates)equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value &#13;
of the Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over their aggregate  Exercise&#13;
Price. If the Optionee is an Employee or a former Employee, the Company will be &#13;
required to withhold from his or her  compensation  or collect from Optionee and&#13;
pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount in cash equal to a percentage&#13;
of this compensation  income at the time of  &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -3-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
exercise,  and may  refuse to honor the  exercise  and refuse to deliver  Shares&#13;
if such  withholding  amounts are not  delivered  at the time of exercise.  &#13;
&#13;
              (ii) Incentive Stock Option.  If this Option qualifies as an ISO, &#13;
the Optionee will have no regular  federal  income tax or state income tax&#13;
liability upon its exercise,  although the excess, if any, of the Fair Market&#13;
Value of the Exercised  Shares on the date of exercise over their  aggregate  &#13;
Exercise Price will be treated as an adjustment to alternative  minimum  taxable&#13;
income for federal tax purposes and may subject the Optionee to alternative  &#13;
minimum tax in the year of  exercise.  In the event  that the  Optionee  &#13;
undergoes  a change of status from Employee to Consultant,  any Incentive  Stock&#13;
Option of the Optionee that remains unexercised shall cease to qualify as an&#13;
Incentive Stock Option and will  be  treated  for  tax  purposes  as a  &#13;
Nonstatutory  Stock  Option  on the ninety-first  (91st) day following  such &#13;
change of status.  &#13;
&#13;
          (b)  Disposition  of Shares.  &#13;
&#13;
               (i) NSO. If the  Optionee holds NSO Shares for at least one year,&#13;
any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term &#13;
capital gain for federal income tax purposes. &#13;
&#13;
              (ii) ISO. If the Optionee holds ISO Shares for at least one year &#13;
after  exercise  and two years after the grant date, any gain realized on &#13;
disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term  capital gain for federal&#13;
income tax  purposes.  If the Optionee  disposes of ISO Shares within one year  &#13;
after  exercise  or two years  after the grant  date,  any gain realized on such&#13;
disposition will be treated as compensation  income (taxable at ordinary income &#13;
rates) to the extent of the excess, if any, of the lesser of (A) the difference &#13;
between the Fair Market Value of the Shares acquired on the date of exercise and&#13;
the aggregate  Exercise Price, or (B) the difference between the sale  price of &#13;
such  Shares  and the  aggregate  Exercise  Price.  &#13;
&#13;
          (c) Notice of Disqualifying  Disposition  of ISO Shares.  If the  &#13;
Optionee  sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Shares acquired pursuant to &#13;
an ISO on or before the later of (i) two years after the grant date, or (ii) one&#13;
year after the exercise date, the  Optionee  shall   immediately   notify  the  &#13;
Company  in  writing  of  such disposition.  The  Optionee  agrees  that he or &#13;
she may be subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation &#13;
income recognized from such early disposition of ISO Shares by payment in cash &#13;
or out of the current earnings paid to the Optionee.  &#13;
&#13;

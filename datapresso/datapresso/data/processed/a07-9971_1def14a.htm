Record Date.



.

Stockholders of record at
the close of business on March 23, 2007 (the Record Date) are entitled
to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date,
26,982,974 shares of the Companys common stock, $0.01 par value (the Common
Stock), were issued and outstanding. For information regarding security
ownership by management and by the beneficial owners of more than 5% of the
Companys Common Stock, see Beneficial Security Ownership of Management and
Certain Beneficial Owners..



.

Revocability of
Proxies.



.

Any proxy given pursuant
to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before
it is voted upon. A proxy may be revoked by (1) delivering to the
Secretary of the Company at the Companys principal executive offices a written
notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy, in either case bearing a later
date than the prior proxy relating to the same shares or (2) attending the
Annual Meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the Annual Meeting
will not of itself revoke a proxy). Any written notice of revocation or
subsequent proxy must be received by the Secretary of the Company prior to the
taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting..



.

Voting and
Solicitation.



.

Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each
share of Common Stock held by such stockholder on the Record Date on all
matters properly submitted for the vote of stockholders at the Annual Meeting.
Stockholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes in the election of
directors..



.

The cost of soliciting
proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition, the Company may reimburse
brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares for
their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners.
Proxies may also be solicited by certain of the .

.

Companys
directors, officers and regular employees, without additional compensation,
personally or by telephone, telegram, letter, electronic mail, or facsimile..



.

Quorum;
Abstentions; Broker Non-Votes.



.

The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of
a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting
is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. A plurality of the
votes duly cast is required for the election of directors. If a plurality of
votes duly cast is not received for the election of a director from our
shareholders, the Board may reconsider whether it should appoint another
director. The Company is seeking the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes duly cast to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the
independent registered public accounting firm of the Company..



.

Under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, an abstaining vote and broker non-vote are counted as present and
entitled to vote and are, therefore, included for the purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting; however, broker non-votes
are not deemed to be votes cast. As a result, broker non-votes are not
included in the tabulation of the voting results on the election of directors
or issues requiring approval of a majority of the votes cast and, therefore, do
not have the effect of votes in opposition in such tabulations. Abstaining
votes are deemed to be votes cast and will have the effect of votes against
issues requiring approval of a majority of the votes cast; however, only
affirmative votes will affect the outcome of the election of directors and,
therefore, abstentions will not have an impact on the election..



.

A broker non-vote occurs
when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a
particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power
with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial
owner..



.

Deadline for
Receipt of Stockholder Proposals.



.

Stockholders may present proper proposals for
inclusion in the Companys proxy statement and for consideration at the next
annual meeting of its stockholders by submitting their proposals in writing to
the Secretary of the Company in a timely manner. In order to be included in the
Companys proxy materials for the 2008 annual meeting of stockholders,
stockholder proposals must be received by the Secretary of the Company no later
than December 18, 2007, and must otherwise comply with the requirements of
Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)..



.

In addition, the Companys Bylaws establish an advance
notice procedure for stockholders who wish to present certain matters before an
annual meeting of stockholders. In general, nominations for the election of
directors may be made by (1) the Board of Directors, (2) the
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or (3) any stockholder
entitled to vote who has delivered written notice to the Secretary of the
Company not less than 120 calendar days before the one year anniversary of the
date on which the Company first mailed its proxy statement to stockholders in
connection with the previous years annual meeting of stockholders, which
notice must contain specified information concerning the nominees and
concerning the stockholder proposing such nominations. Stockholder nominations
to the Board of Directors must meet the requirements set forth in Section 2.5  of the Companys Bylaws. Under these
requirements, nominations for election to the Board of Directors may be made at
a meeting of stockholders by any stockholder who is entitled to vote in the
election of directors and provides timely written notice to the Secretary of
the Company. This notice must contain specified information concerning the
nominee and concerning the stockholder proposing the nomination. In order to be
timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by
the Secretary of the Company not less than 120 calendar days before the one
year anniversary of the date on which the Company first mailed its proxy
statement to stockholders in connection with the previous years annual meeting
of stockholders. For .

Bylaws, please write to the Corporate Secretary at the Companys executive
offices set forth above..



.

The Companys Bylaws also provide that the only
business that may be conducted at an annual meeting is business that is: (1) specified
in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors, (2) properly brought before the
meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (3) properly brought
before the meeting by any stockholder entitled to vote who has written notice
delivered to or mailed and received at the Companys principal executive
offices (no later than December 18, 2007 for the 2008 annual meeting of
stockholders), which notice must contain specified information concerning the
matters to be brought before such meeting and concerning the stockholder
proposing such matters..



.

A copy of the full text of
the Bylaw provisions discussed above may be obtained by writing to the Secretary
of the Company. All notices of proposals by stockholders, whether or not
included in the Companys proxy materials, should be sent to Advent Software, Inc.,
Corporate Secretary, 600 Townsend Street, San Francisco, California 94103..

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE.



.

Board of Directors.



.

The primary responsibility
of the Board of Directors (the Board) is to foster the long-term success of
the Company, consistent with its fiduciary duty to stockholders. The Board has
responsibility for oversight of broad corporate policies, formulation of the
long-term strategic, financial and organizational goals of the Company, and
management, which is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company.
In fulfilling its role, each director nominee must exercise his or her good faith
business judgment of the best interests of the Company..



.

Governance
Principles, Code of Business Ethics and Conduct.



.

The Board has adopted
Corporate Governance Principles. In addition, the Company has adopted a Code of
Business Ethics and Conduct for its directors, officers, and employees,
including its principal executive and senior financial officers. These
materials are available on the Investor Relations section of the Companys web
site, www.advent.com. If the Board makes any
substantive amendment to this Code of Business Ethics and Conduct or grants any
waiver, including any implicit waiver, from the provisions of the Code to one
of our principal executive or senior financial officers, we will disclose the
nature of the amendment or waiver on Advents web site, located at www.advent.com, or in a current report on Form 8-K..



.

Director
Independence.



.

The Board has determined
that all directors other

Audit
Committee.   As of the date of this proxy
statement, the Audit Committee, which has been established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of
the Exchange Act, consists of Ms. Carlitz and Messrs. Kirsner, Van
Auken and Zuendt, each of whom is independent, as defined by the listing
standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market for audit committee members and meets the
criteria for independence under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.
The Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Carlitz and Messrs. Kirsner,
Van Auken and Zuendt are audit committee financial experts as defined under
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The Audit
Committee acts pursuant to a written charter adopted and approved by the Board
of Directors, which is available at the Companys web site, www.advent.com. The Audit Committee is responsible for,
among other things, assisting the Board of Directors in fulfilling its
responsiblities for oversight of (i) the integrity of the financial
statements of the Company, (ii) the compliance by the Company with legal
and regulatory requirements related to financial affairs and reporting, (iii) the
qualifications, independence and performance of the Companys independent
registered public accounting firm and (iv) the system of internal controls
regarding finance, accounting and legal compliance of the Company. See also Audit
Committee Report for the Year Ended December 31, 2006..



.

Compensation
Committee.   As of the date of this proxy statement,
the Compensation Committee consists of Ms. Carlitz and Messrs. Battle
and Roemer, each of whom is independent as defined in the listing standards
of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Compensation Committee acts pursuant to a
written charter adopted and approved by the Board of Directors, which is
available at the Companys web site, www.advent.com.
For a description of the Compensation Committees responsibilities, see the
Scope of Authority section under Compensation Committee Matters. See also Compensation

date of this proxy statement, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee

 .



.






.

adopted and approved by
the Board of Directors, which is available at the Companys web site, www.advent.com. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee
is responsible for, among other things, (i) overseeing compliance by the Board of Directors and its committees with applicable laws and
regulations, including those promulgated by the SEC and the listing standards
of The Nasdaq Stock Market, (ii) development of general criteria
regarding the qualifications and selection of board members and recommending
candidates for election to the Board of Directors, (iii) developing
overall governance guidelines, (iv) overseeing the performance and
compensation of the Board of Directors, and (v) reviewing and making
recommendations regarding the composition and mandate of Board committees..



.

Meeting Attendance.



.

During 2006, the Board of Directors held a total of
eight meetings (including regularly scheduled and special meetings) and took
action twice by unanimous written consent. No incumbent director during the
last year, while a member of the Board of Directors, attended fewer than 75% of
(i) the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors or (ii) the
total number of meetings held by all committees on which such director served..



.

Although the Company does
not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at the
Companys annual meeting of stockholders, the Company encourages, but does not
require, directors to attend. At the time of the Companys 2006 annual meeting,
all eight members of the Companys Board of Directors attended the meeting..



.

Communication with
the Board.



.

Any stockholder who
desires to contact our Board of Directors may do so by writing to: Board of
Directors, c/o Chairman of Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee,
Advent Software, Inc., 600 Townsend Street, San Francisco, California
94103. Communications will be distributed to the Chairman of the Board or the
other members of the Board as appropriate depending on the facts and
circumstances outlined in the communication received..



.

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE MATTERS.



.

Process for
Nominating Directors.



.

The Corporate Governance and
Nominating Committee is responsible for, among other things, determining the
criteria for membership to the Board of Directors and recommending candidates
for election to the Board of Directors. It is the policy of the Committee to
consider recommendations for candidates to the Board of Directors from
stockholders. Stockholder recommendations for candidates to the Board of
Directors must be directed in writing to Advent Software, Inc., Corporate
Secretary, 600 Townsend Street, San Francisco, California 94103, and must
include the candidates name, home and business contact information, detailed
biographical data and qualifications, information regarding any relationships
between the candidate and the Company within the last three years, and evidence
of the recommending persons ownership of the Companys Common Stock..



.

The Committees general process and criteria for
identifying and evaluating the candidates that it recommends to the full Board
for selection as director nominees are as follows:.



.

*       The
Committee regularly reviews the composition and size of the Board..



.

*       In
evaluating and identifying candidates, the Committee has the authority to
retain and terminate any third-party search firm that is used to identify
director candidates, and has the authority to approve the fees and retention
terms of any search firm. During 2006, the Company utilized Korn/Ferry
International to assist in identifying potential director candidates but did
not engage any persons identified by such entity and paid fees of less than
$1,000 to Korn/Ferry International..




 .

5.


.

.



.






.




.

*       In
its evaluation of director candidates, including the members of the Board of
Directors eligible for re-election, the Committee seeks to achieve a balance of
knowledge, experience and capability on the Board and considers (1) the
size and composition of the Board of Directors and the needs of the Board of
Directors and the respective committees of the Board, (2) such factors as
issues of character, judgment, diversity, age, expertise, business experience,
length of service, independence, other commitments and the like, and (3) such
other factors as the Committee may consider appropriate..



.

*       While
the Committee has not established specific minimum qualifications for Director
candidates, the Committee believes that candidates and nominees must reflect a
Board that is comprised of directors who (1) are predominantly
independent, (2) are of high integrity, (3) have broad,
business-related knowledge and experience at the policy-making level in
business, or technology, including an understanding of the financial services
industry and Advents business in particular, (4) have qualifications that
will increase overall Board effectiveness and (5) meet other requirements
as may be required by applicable rules, such as financial literacy or financial
expertise with respect to Audit Committee members..



.

*       With
regard to candidates who are properly recommended by stockholders or by other
means, the Committee will review the qualifications of any such candidate,
which review may, at the Committees discretion, include interviewing
references for the candidate, direct interviews with the candidate, background
checks by the Committee or by a third party service provider or other actions
that the Committee deems necessary or proper..



.

*       The
Committee will apply these same principles when evaluating Board candidates who
may be elected initially by the full Board to fill vacancies or add additional
directors prior to the annual meeting of stockholders at which directors are
elected..



.

After completing its review and evaluation of director
candidates, the Committee recommends to the full Board of Directors the
director nominees for selection..



.

Compensation of
Non-Employee Directors.



.

The
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates and makes
recommendations to the Board regarding the form and amount of compensation for
non-employee directors. Directors who are employees of Advent receive no
additional compensation for service on the Board. Advents director
compensation program is designed to enable continued attraction and retention
of highly qualified directors by ensuring that director compensation is in line
with peer companies competing for director talent, and is designed to address
the time, effort, expertise and accountability required of active Board
membership. In general, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and
the Board believe that annual compensation for non-employee directors should
consist of both a cash component, designed to compensate members for their
service on the Board and its Committees, and an equity component, designed to
align the interests of directors and stockholders and, by vesting over time, to
create an incentive for continued service on the Board..



.

The
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee annually reviews director
compensation, including, among other things, comparing Advents director
compensation practices with those of other public companies of comparable size.
In conducting such review, the committee may, in its discretion, retain the
services of a compensation consultant..



.

Cash Compensation.   Each
non-employee director, other than the Chairman of the Board, receives an annual
retainer of $30,000, and the Chairman of the Board receives an annual retainer
of $40,000. The Chair of the Audit Committee receives an annual fee of $25,000,
and the directors who serve on the Audit Committee receive $15,000 per annum.
The Chair of the Compensation Committee receives an annual fee of $15,000, and
the directors who serve on the Compensation Committee receive $10,000 per
annum. The Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee receives
an annual fee of $10,000, and the directors who serve on the Corporate
Governance and Nominating Committee receive $5,000 per annum..




 .

6.

 .



.






.

All retainers and fees are paid quarterly in arrears,
and the non-employee directors are eligible for reimbursement of their expenses
incurred in connection with attendance at Board meetings in accordance with
Advent policy..



.

Equity Award Grants.   The
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may recommend changes to the
levels of option grants, which must be approved by the full Board. Effective April 1,
2005, each non-employee director became eligible to receive awards under the
2002 Plan of (i) an initial option grant of 30,000 shares upon joining the
Board, which vests over four years, with 25% of the shares vesting after one
year of service and the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments over
the ensuing three years, and (ii) an annual option grant of 12,000 shares
vesting in twelve equal monthly installments. Upon retirement from the Board,
unvested options are canceled and returned to the Plan. On February 26,
2007, the Board, upon recommendation by the Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee, approved the form and amount of revised equity awards automatically
granted to non-employee directors. Effective February 26, 2007, each
non-employee director became eligible to receive awards under the 2002 Plan of (i) an
initial one-time grant of 21,000 shares of stock appreciation rights (SAR),
upon joining the Board, which vests over four years with 25% of the shares
vesting one year after the date of grant and the remainder vesting in equal
monthly installments over the ensuing three years, and 4,500 shares of
restricted stock units (RSU), which vest over four years with 50% of the
shares vesting two years after the date of grant and 50% vesting four years
after the date of grant; and (ii) annual grants of 8,400 shares of SARs
and 1,800 shares of RSUs, which vest 100% one year after the date of grant. In
the event of a merger with or into another corporation, or other change in
control, each non-employee director
shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her
outstanding equity compensation (including outstanding stock options, SARs,
RSUs, or performance shares). Upon a directors retirement from the
Board, the directors unvested SARs and RSUs are canceled and returned to the
Plan..



.

Non-Employee Director
Compensation Table.



.

In May 2006, each non-employee director received
their annual option grant of 12,000 shares pursuant to the 2002 Plan. In January 2006,
an initial option grant of 30,000 shares was granted to Mr. Kirsner upon
his appointment to the Board..

The following table summarizes compensation of the
non-employee directors during fiscal 2006 with respect to their Board service:.

stock option awards. Amounts shown do not reflect compensation actually
received by the non-employee director. Instead, the amounts in the Option

accordance with SFAS 123R (excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures related
to service-based vesting conditions), and include amounts attributable to
awards granted during and before 2006. Excluding the impact of estimated
forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions, assumptions made in
the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 9, Stock Based

Form 10-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on

AUDIT COMMITTEE
MATTERS.



.

Audit Committee
Report for the Year Ended December 31, 2006.



.

The Audit Committee provides oversight of the Companys
accounting and financial reporting processes and the audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the Company. The Audit Committee assists the Board in
fulfilling its responsibilities for oversight of the integrity of Advents
consolidated financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements
related to financial affairs and reporting, the independent registered public
accounting firms (auditors) qualifications, independence and performance,
and Advents system of internal controls regarding finance, accounting and
legal compliance..



.

The management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and for
preparing the Companys consolidated financial statements. The independent
registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing the financial
statements. It is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to oversee these
activities. It is not the responsibility of the Audit Committee to prepare or
certify the Companys financial statements or guarantee the audits or reports
of the independent auditors, nor is it the duty of the Audit Committee to
certify that the independent auditor is independent under applicable rules.
These are the fundamental responsibilities of Company management and the
independent auditors..



.

In the performance
of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has:.



.

*       reviewed
and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Advents independent registered public accounting
firm, and Advent management;.



.

*       discussed
with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the matters required to be discussed by the
Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (required communications with audit
committees) and SAS 99 (consideration of fraud in a financial statement audit);.



.

*       discussed
with Advents management and with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the evaluation of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting and the audit of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, as
required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and.



.

*       received
the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required
by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, and has discussed
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPs independence with them..



.

Based upon these discussions and review, the Audit
Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial
statements be included in Advents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 for filing with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission..

Carlitz, James D. Kirsner, Wendell G. Van Auken and William F. Zuendt, each of
whom is an independent director as defined in Rule 4200(a)(154) of the
Marketplace Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. and meets the
criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the
Exchange Act. The Board has determined that each of Ms. Carlitz and Messrs. Kirsner,
Van Auken, and Zuendt qualify as an audit committee financial expert, as
defined in Rule 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K..

PROPOSAL NO. 2.



.

RATIFICATION OF
APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM.



.

The Board of Directors has
selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting
firm, to audit the financial statements of the Company for the year ending December 31,
2007. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Companys financial statements
since 1989. A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is expected to be
present at the meeting, where they will be available to respond to appropriate
questions and, if they desire, to make a statement..



.

Required Vote.



.

Stockholder ratification of the selection of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm is not required by the Companys Bylaws, or other applicable
legal requirement. However, as a matter of good corporate practice, the Board
of Directors has conditioned its appointment of the Companys independent
registered public accounting firm upon the receipt of the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented, in person or by proxy, and duly cast at the
Annual Meeting, which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a
majority of the required quorum. In the event that the stockholders do not
approve the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the appointment of the
independent registered public accounting firm will be reconsidered by the Audit
Committee and the Board of Directors. Even if the selection is ratified, the
Board at its discretion and at the direction of the Audit Committee may direct
the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at
any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders..



.

THE BOARD
OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE
RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AS INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2007.
THE EFFECT OF AN ABSTENTION IS THE SAME AS A VOTE AGAINST THE RATIFICATION OF
THE APPOINTMENT..

.

Purpose of the
Compensation Committee.



.

The Compensation

policies and programs. The purpose of the Committee is to:.



.

*       Provide
oversight of the Companys compensation policies, plans and benefit programs,.



.

*       Assist
the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to:.



.

any signing bonus or payment of relocation costs, and; vi) factors related to
the performance of the Company,.



.

*       Review and recommend for
Board approval the Companys equity compensation plans for its executive
officers and employees (for example the 2002 Stock Plan, as amended and

.

Responsibilities of
the Compensation Committee.



.

*       Review

.

*       Review
and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation and CEO
performance, and.



.

*       Conduct
periodic competitive evaluations of the executive officer compensation plans.



.

A principal objective of the Compensation Committee is
to use compensation to align the interests of executive officers with the
long-term interests of the Companys shareholders. The compensation programs
for Advents executive officers are designed to attract, motivate and retain
talented executives responsible for the success of the Company, and is
determined within a competitive framework and based on the achievement of the
Company and individual performance goals..



.

The Compensation Committee
operates pursuant to a charter that further outlines the specific authority,
duties and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee. The charter is
periodically reviewed and revised (and was most recently revised on February 9,
2006) by the Compensation Committee and our Board, and is available at.

.

The
Compensation Committee generally holds at least four scheduled meetings during
the year and holds additional meetings periodically to review and discuss
executive compensation issues. The Committee may also consider and take action
by written consent. The key tasks for each proposed or actual meeting in 2007
are summarized below:.

quarterly basis it reviews reports on equity compensation usage. The Committee
reviews progress against annual performance goals at mid-year..



.

Advents Human Resources Department supports the
Compensation Committee in its work and in some cases acts pursuant to delegated
authority to fulfill various functions in administering Advents compensation
programs. The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage the services
of outside advisers, experts and others to assist the Committee. During 2006, the
Committee employed Compensia, Inc. (Compensia), an independent
consulting company to provide advice and information relating to executive and
director compensation. Compensia assisted the Committee in the creation of
executive bonus structures, equity incentives and in evaluating base salary
levels. Compensia reports directly to the Committee. From time to time, the
Committee may direct its advisor to work with the Human Resources Department to
support management and the Committee in matters such as: i) peer group
development; ii) executive officer benchmarking, including
pay-for-performance analyses and tally sheet preparation; and iii) advising
on cash-based incentives and equity program design. The Committee plans to
continue to use Compensia in 2007 as its independent advisor..



.

As of December 31,
2006, the Compensation Committee was comprised of Ms. Terry H. Carlitz,
and Messrs. A. George Battle and James P. Roemer. Mr. Battle is the
Chairman of the Compensation Committee. All Committee members meet the Nasdaq
Stock Markets requirement for independence, the definition of a non-employee
director under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and the Internal Revenue
Codes criteria of an outside director..



.

Executive
Compensation Philosophy and Framework.



.

Compensation
Objectives.



.

Advents executive
compensation program is designed to achieve four primary objectives:.



.

1.                Attract and retain
highly skilled executives who will create and sustain stockholder value..




 .

15.


.

.



.






.




.

2.                Reinforce a
persistent focus to improve market position and achieve the Companys
operational objectives..



.

3.                Support a strong
pay-for-performance culture that provides market-leading compensation
commensurate with outstanding performance..



.

4.                Align
the interests of the executive officers with the long-term interests of the
Companys stockholders, thereby enhancing stockholder value..



.

Target Pay
Position/Mix of Pay.



.

The main components of pay the Company uses to support
these objectives are base salary, annual cash incentive and equity (discussed
in greater detail below under Evaluation of Executive Officer Compensation).
For each of these three elements, Advents strategy has been to examine peer
group compensation practices and target total cash compensation (base plus
bonus) between the 50th and 75th percentile of the
peer group, weighted towards incentive bonus compensation, and between the 50th and 75th for equity
compensation. These target pay positions are the within the same range for all
employees in the Company..



.

The Compensation Committee
has historically approved compensation levels for officers above and below the
target pay position, based on individual and Company performance relative to
the peer group, to ensure an appropriate pay-for-performance alignment. This
pay-for-performance alignment is further supported by Advents emphasis on
variable, or at-risk, compensation, which ensures that executives receive
target or above-target total compensation only to the extent that Company
performance has been achieved..



.

Compensation
Benchmarking.



.

The Compensation Committee examines the compensation
practices of two peer groups to assess the competitiveness of executive officer
compensation practices and levels. The first peer group (Current Peers)
includes software companies that are similar in business strategy and are
comparable on the basis of market capitalization, competition for labor,
revenue and number of employees. The pay practices of the Current Peers are the
primary benchmark used when considering the competitiveness of officer
compensation levels and represent labor market competitors and those companies
considered to be exercising best practices with respect to executive
compensation..



.

The Current
Peers had the following profile:.

The peer group is reviewed annually by the
Compensation Committee and adjustments are made as necessary to ensure the
group continues to properly reflect the market in which Advent competes for
talent. The Compensation Committee also annually reviews the executive pay
practices of other similarly situated companies as reported in industry surveys
and reports from compensation consulting firms. This information is considered
when making recommendations for each element of compensation..



.

The second peer group (Next Stage Peers) includes
software companies deemed to be industry leaders as measured by financial
performance, stockholder value creation and market share. The compensation
policies of Next Stage Peers are reviewed so that the Compensation Committee
can understand best compensation practices of larger, highly successful
companies and determine whether any .




 .

16.

 .



.






.

of these practices have
applicability to Advent. We do not consider the levels of pay, however, for
executives in the Next Stage Peers when setting compensation for our
executives..



.

The companies in the
Current and Next Stage Peers are generally consistent with but not exactly the
same as those contained in the performance graph under Item 5. Market for
Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of
Equity Securities included in the Companys Form 10-K/A for the
year ended December 31, 2006. The primary difference is that companies in
the Performance Measurement Graph may include companies that are significantly
larger than Advent and/or do not meet the criteria stated above for the Current
and Next Stage Peers and thus, are not deemed to be suitable peers for
benchmarking executive compensation levels..



.

Evaluation of
Executive Officer Compensation.



.

Cash Compensation.



.

Base Salary.



.

Base salaries are used to attract, motivate and retain
highly qualified executives. Base salary, which is determined by the level of
responsibility, expertise and experience of the employee, and competitive
conditions in the industry, is the primary fixed compensation in the executive
pay program. Based on the experience of the Committee members and review by our
third-party compensation consultant, the Committee believes that the salaries
of its officers fall within the norm of the industry (software) in which
Advent participates..



.

The Compensation Committee
believes that increases to base salary should reflect the individuals
performance for the preceding year and his or her pay level relative to similar
positions in our peer group, taking performance into account, as well as
internal equity with respect to the rest of the executive team. Base salary
increases also reflect anticipated future contributions of the executives..



.

Bonus.



.

Advents annual bonus
program is an at-risk compensation arrangement designed to reward executives
for achieving key operational goals that we believe will provide the foundation
for creating longer-term stockholder value. For executive officers, target
bonus opportunities range from 35% to 67% of base salary, which provides a
target bonus opportunity that is between the 50th and 75th percentile
relative to the Current Peers. Officers may earn up to 200% of their target
annual bonus award based on overachievement of the plan goals..



.

Total Target Cash
Compensation.



.

As part of an annual
process, our Chief Executive Officer presents her total target cash
compensation recommendations for the executive officers (except herself),
including the Named Executive Officers, to the Committee in the first quarter
of the fiscal year..



.

2006.



.

In March, 2006 our CEO proposed target cash
compensation salary levels for 2006 that represented an average increase of
4.2% over 2005 salary levels for all executive officers, and 4.9% for the Named
Executive Officers (excluding the CEO). Our CEO proposed an increase for Mr. Smith
of 4.6%, with a target bonus of 41% of base salary. This increase was in line
with the salary increase budget for 2006 for our Company as a whole and the
approved rate of increase for employees who exceeded performance objectives and
had a base salary that approximated the markets (market defined as the Current
Peers) 50th percentile..




 .

17.

 .



.






.

Our CEO proposed salary increases for Ms. Chang
and Mr. Hess of 4.7%, and 5.0%, respectively. For both of these
individuals, the salary increases reflect their performance rating, their
market position relative to the external market, and our CEOs assessment that
retaining these individuals was critical to Advents long-term success. The
competitive position of Ms. Changs salary is reflective of her long
tenure with the Company, the criticality of her role, and the highly
competitive labor market with respect to her role. Mr. Nye, who has since
left the Company in February 2007, received an increase of 5.2% based on
his performance during the year and his position relative to the peer group..



.

After discussing the performance of each executive
officer with the CEO and her recommendations, the Committee approved the
proposed salary increases for the above executive officers. Ms. Changs
target bonus was 41% of her base salary, and Mr. Hess was 44% of base
salary..



.

The Compensation Committee reviewed competitive
analyses developed by our outside consultant and with input from the full Board
approved a compensation package for our CEO. For 2006, the Committee
recommended that the CEOs target total cash compensation be increased to
$625,200, which approximated the 50th percentile of our Current Peers and
represented an increase of 4.2%. Ms. DiMarcos target bonus was set at 67%
of her base salary..



.

Salary increases were
effective April 2006. Compensation actions are taken in April to
allow time to assess individual and Company performance data for the prior
fiscal year that is not available prior to that time..



.

2007.



.

In March 2007, our CEO proposed salaries for 2007
that represented an average increase of 6.2% over 2006 salary levels for all
executive officers and 6.9% for the Named Executive Officers (excluding the
CEO), reflecting the competitive environment and movement in our market
(Current Peers). Our CEO proposed a salary increase for Mr. Smith of 7.2%,
reflecting the highly competitive market for CFOs and Mr. Smiths
performance. Mr. Smiths target bonus is 45% of his base salary..



.

Our CEO proposed a salary increase for Ms. Chang
of 7.4%, reflecting her performance and the critical nature of her role. Ms. Changs
target bonus comprises 42% of her base salary. Our CEO proposed a salary
increase for Mr. Hess of 10.2% reflecting his performance and his
increased responsibility in managing a larger business unit. Mr. Hess
target bonus is 49% of his base salary. Mr. Nye left the Company in February of
2007 before any salary increase was proposed for him..



.

As in 2006, the Compensation Committee reviewed
competitive analyses developed by our external consultant and with input from
the full Board approved a compensation package for our CEO. For 2007, the CEOs
target total cash compensation was increased to $700,000, which approximates
the 50th percentile of our current stage peer group.
This resulted in a 7.7% increase to her target total cash compensation. Ms. DiMarcos
target bonus represents 65% of her base salary..



.

Salary increases were
effective April 2007 to allow time to assess individual and Company
performance data that is not available prior to that time..



.

Corporate Bonus
Payouts for Performance in 2006.



.

At the
beginning of each year, the Compensation Committee approves specific goals for
the upcoming year, for purposes of the executive incentive bonus plan. In
addition to traditional measures of corporate and business unit performance,
such as bookings, revenue and profit performance, the Compensation Committee
emphasizes other indications of performance, including individual performance,
and approves associated weightings. Individual performance, as determined
through the achievement of pre-established objectives, can modify the award
determined under the following grid by 0% to 125%, subject to an individual
maximum award equal to 200% of target bonus. For 2006, the corporate measures
were the total .

Corporate performance
exceeded plan in 2006 and for both measures was near the maximum. The plan
stipulates certain thresholds to trigger bonus payments, including achievement
of at least 75% of the Companys non-GAAP operating profit (which is equal to
GAAP operating profit less the effect of costs from amortization of developed
technology and other intangibles, restructuring charges, and stock-based
compensation) goal; Advents 2006 operating profit exceeded threshold and plan..



.

In January 2007, the
CEO presented her recommendations for bonus payments to executive officers,
based on corporate and individual performance in 2006 (all executives received Meets
Expectations or Exceeds Expectations of individual performance ratings).
Based upon corporate and individual performance, the Committee recommended the
bonus payout for the CEO. The Compensation Committee reviewed and verified the
percent of goal achieved for each corporate goal, along with the overall
percent of corporate goal achievement for purposes of bonus plan payouts..



.

The
Compensation Committee approved the following 2006 bonus payments for officers,
based on the corporate and individual performance assessments tabled below:.

The CEOs Corporate Achievement
rating reflects her request (which the Compensation Committee honored) to have
her bonus capped at 100% of target..



.

The
approved bonus payments resulted in total cash compensation between the 55th percentile and
75th percentile of
market. The Compensation Committee noted that Advents 2006 performance
compared favorably to its Current Peers..



.

For 2007, target bonus
levels for executive officers are similar to target bonus levels set in 2006;
however, the operating profit threshold for any payout will be raised to 80% of
the business plan goal from its 2006 level of 75%..



.

Equity Compensation: Overview.



.

Compensation tied to the performance of the Companys
Common Stock is a key element of our executive compensation program. Officers
and other employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the 2002
Stock Plan and the 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan),
which was adopted in May of 2005. The 2002 Stock Plan permits the
Compensation Committee to grant stock options and other equity vehicles to
employees on such terms as the Committee may determine subject to the
limitations of the plan. The Committee, or a sub-committee consisting of
Ms. DiMarco in the case of non-executive grants under our 2002 Stock Plan,
currently administers grants of stock options, SARs and RSUs to non-executive
officer employees..




 .

.




.

In determining the size of an equity grant to a new
officer or other key employee, the Committee takes into account equity
participation by comparable employees within the Company, external competitive
circumstances and other relevant factors. The Committee has also adopted a set
of guidelines for use with equity grants to employees other than executive
officers which were established using information gathered by an independent
third-party consultant in order to assist with equity grants. The Committee may
approve grants outside these guidelines under compelling reasons relating to
the reward and retention of key, high performing and high potential staff.
Additional awards may be granted to current employees to reward exceptional
performance or to provide additional unvested equity incentives..



.

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits employees to
acquire Common Stock of the Company through payroll deductions and promotes
broad-based equity participation throughout the Company..



.

The Committee believes its stock-based plans align the
interests of the employees with the long-term interests of the stockholders..



.

Equity compensation
represents the largest component of our executive officer compensation program
at Advent. We believe this is an appropriate way to align the interests of our
executive officers with those of our stockholders in order to achieve and
sustain long-term stockholder value. In designing the equity program, Advent is
sensitive to stockholder concerns about potential dilution from stock based programs
As a consequence, management and the Compensation Committee have taken the
following steps to manage the equity plan:.



.

*       The
Committee strives to limit annual net issuances of stock-based awards to a
level that is within the norm of our current stage peer group, subject to
extraordinary events (e.g., acquisitions and new executive hires). The
Committee will adjust this target rate from year-to-year based on performance
and retention issues, and to stay in line with market practices. Our average
actual net issuance of stock-based awards was 3.1% of outstanding common stock
in 2006. This level is reflective of strong 2005 Company performance and
increased competition in the labor market. Advents 3.1% burn rate is
consistent with that of current stage peer group norms, which range from 2.3%
to 3.6%. (For purposes of this calculation, each share granted as a RSU and
each SAR is counted as one share)..



.

*       The
target grant levels for executive officer equity grants are structured in
consideration of peer group practice with respect to the economic value of
equity compensation (i.e., the Black-Scholes value of stock options and face
value of RSUs)..



.

*       Equity
grants to individual executive officers are generally adjusted from target
based on individual performance against their annual goals in the preceding
year, the expected future contribution and long-term retention of the executive
and our performance compared to the peer group..



.

We do not currently have
stock ownership guidelines for the executive officers. The Compensation
Committee does not believe such requirements are necessary at this time because
the executive officers have a long history of holding equity grants until the
end of their terms, and thus have established substantial, personal financial
stakes in the Companys performance. In addition, our CEO beneficially owns
shares representing approximately 8.6% of our outstanding common stock as of March 23,
2007..



.

Equity
Compensation: 2006 Awards.



.

In 2006, the Company began issuing RSUs and SARs, in
lieu of the historically preferred instrument of stock options, after a review
of its stock option program. The Committee believes that these equity vehicles
best support the following objectives: (i) support Advents
executive/employee attraction and retention initiatives; (ii) provide the
appropriate incentive to executives and employees to create long-term
stockholder value; and (iii) serve the best interests of Advents
stockholders..




 .

20.

 .



.






.

For executives,
approximately 70% of their equity awards are delivered in SARs and
approximately 30% in RSUs. This mix reflects the Compensation Committees
pay-for-performance orientation because an individual receives value from the
SAR award only if Advents stock price increases (which provides for alignment
with stockholders). The Company will continue to monitor developments in this
area and the Compensation Committee retains the discretion, if necessary, to
make adjustments to the equity program consistent with the objectives stated
above..

*                    The
Compensation Committee and Board recommended a grant to Ms. DiMarco for
2007, however she elected not to accept a grant this year..



.

**             Mr. Nye resigned
from the Company effective February 2007 and no equity awards were granted
to him during 2007..



.

SARs were granted with an
exercise price of $37.14, the fair market value on the date of grant..



.

Benefits and
Perquisites.



.

We do not provide pension arrangements or
post-retirement health coverage for our executives or employees. The benefits
offered to our executive officers are substantially the same as those offered
to all our employees..



.

We provide medical and other benefits to executives
that are generally available to other full-time employees, including an
employee stock purchase plan, group term life insurance premiums and a 401(k) plan.
The 401(k) is a contributory defined contribution plan and Advents
contributions are based on years of service. Within the first three years of
service, Advent offers a matching contribution equal to 50% of the first 6% of
the participants compensation that has been contributed to the plan, up to a
maximum contribution of $3,500. Employees with three to five years of service
receive 100% of the first 1% and 50% of the next 5% of pay deferred, up to the
maximum allowed. Employees with more than five years receive 100% of the first
2% deferred and 50% of the next 4% deferred, up to the annual limit..



.

All of our executive
officers participated in our 401(k) plan during fiscal 2006 and received
matching contributions..



.

Post-Employment
Obligations.



.

We adopted the Advent Software Executive Severance
Plan (the Severance Plan) to provide severance benefits for executive
officers, upon involuntary termination by us in the event of a Company-wide
lay-off, departmental reorganization or significant restructuring of an
individuals job duties, or following a change of control. The severance plan
protects the Company by providing a standard policy for executive officer
severance rights and ensures that we have consistency and parity among the
executive .




 .

 .



.






.

offices upon the
occurrence of such events. We believe the plan also assures stockholders that
the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of the
executive, notwithstanding the possibility or occurrence of a restructuring or
change of control..



.

Change of control is defined
as: i) the sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the Companys assets to any person (as such term is used
in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), entity or group of persons
acting in concert; ii) any person or group of persons becoming the beneficial
owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 35% or more of the total
voting power represented by the Companys then outstanding voting securities;
iii) a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation,
other than a merger or consolidation that would result in the voting securities
of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent
(either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities
of the surviving entity or its controlling entity) at least 50% of the total
voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such
surviving entity (or its controlling entity) outstanding immediately after such
merger or consolidation; or iv) a contest for the election or removal of
members of the Board that results in the removal from the Board of at least 50%
of the incumbent members of the Board..



.

In the event of termination
following a change of control, executives will be entitled to severance
payments consisting of: i) continuing payments at a rate equal to his or
her base salary rate, as then in effect, for a period of 12 months from the
date of such termination, to be paid periodically in accordance with the
Companys normal payroll policies; ii)
all expense reimbursements and any other benefits due to Executive through the
date of termination of employment in accordance with established Company plans
and policies applicable to Executive; iii) Company-paid coverage for a
period of 12 months for the Executives and the Executives eligible dependents
under the Companys health benefit plans (or, at the Companys option, coverage
under a separate plan); iv) all of Executives outstanding stock options (or
other rights to purchase common stock of the Company), SARs, restricted stock,
RSUs, or performance shares, together Equity Compensation) on the
termination date, have their vesting accelerated as to 30 months of additional
vesting, which is one-half the normal five year vesting period for an option or
SAR grant; with post-termination exercisability as specified in the applicable
Equity Compensation agreement; and v) receive such other compensation or
benefits from the Company as may be available under Company benefit plans..



.

The Severance Plan also
provides the foregoing benefits for executive officers who are involuntarily
terminated (other than for Cause), with the exception that the vesting of any
unvested Equity Compensation is 12 months. In event of the executives death or
disability, the executive or his/her estate will receive six months of base
salary, six months of benefits coverage, and any other compensation or benefit
as required by law..



.

Tally Sheets/Total
Compensation.



.

Compensation tally sheets for each of the Named
Executive Officers were prepared and reviewed by the Compensation Committee in
2006. These tally sheets affixed dollar amounts to all components of the Named
Executive Officers compensation, including current pay (salary and bonus),
outstanding equity awards, benefits, perquisites and potential
change-in-control severance payments. The Compensation Committee reviews tally
sheets at least on an annual basis..



.

The Compensation Committee
believes it is fulfilling the Companys compensation objectives and in
particular, rewarding executive officers in a manner that supports our strong
pay-for-performance philosophy. Executive compensation is tied directly to the
Companys performance and is structured to ensure that there is an appropriate
balance between our long-term and short-term performance, and also a balance
between our operational performance and stockholder return. On average, the
total target pay .




 .

22.

 .



.






.

position
for the Named Executive Officers in 2006 was between the 50th and 65th percentile of the
peer group and the average resulting pay mix was 25% in base salary, 20% in
target annual bonus opportunity and 55% in equity grant value. Our 2006
performance relative to this same peer group approximated or exceeded the 50th percentile with respect to: earnings growth
and growth in market capitalization. Based on our track record of strong
performance relative to industry peers and the stated compensation objectives,
management and the Compensation Committee believes the average target pay
position relative to market and pay mix are reasonable and appropriate..



.

Equity Grant Practices.



.

The Compensation Committee approves all equity grants
to our executive officers. Beginning in 2007, the Company has adopted a policy
to award our annual merit equity grants to all existing employees only during
open trading windows. Additionally, all equity grants will be awarded on the 10th business day of the month. In 2007, the annual
merit equity grant for both executive officers and employees were awarded on February 14,
2007. The Compensation Committee selected the February date for the annual
equity grant because it coincided with: i) the Committee/Board review of prior
year Company and individual performance; and ii) the approval of other
executive officer compensation decisions (i.e., salary increases, bonus
payments, etc.). Further, the Committee and our Board believe it is a better
practice to approve executive officer grants during a regular meeting, so that
the Compensation Committee members can carefully deliberate our executive
officers and CEOs compensation arrangements..



.

As discussed above, the
Compensation Committee has created a sub-committee consisting of our CEO for
the purpose of making grants to non-executive officer employees. Grants by the
CEO, which must be within pre-established guidelines based on employee level,
are made subject to an annual equity pool approved by the Board, which for 2006
was approximately 1.1 million shares and for 2007 is approximately 1.0 million.
The CEO and Human Resources Department are required to provide quarterly
tracking updates to the Compensation Committee regarding equity usage. The
grant date for new hire awards is the 10th business day of the month, following
the date of hire..



.

Tax Considerations.



.

We believe it is in our best interest, to the extent
practical, to have executive officer compensation be fully deductible under Section 162(m).
Section 162(m) of the Code generally provides that publicly-held
companies may not deduct compensation paid to certain of its top executive officers
to the extent that such compensation exceeds $1 million per officer in a
calendar year. Compensation that is performance-based compensation within the
meaning of the Code does not count toward the $1 million limit..



.

We have taken steps to
ensure that payments to executive officers under the Corporate Bonus and equity
compensation programs meet the Section 162(m) requirements, where
feasible. The Compensation Committee retains the discretion to provide
compensation that potentially may not be fully deductible to reward performance
and/or enhance retention. Stock options granted under our 2002 plan meet the
requirement of 162(m). Currently our bonus plan does not meet the requirements
because it is not shareholder approved. Likewise, RSUs do not meet the
performance requirement under 162(m). Executive pay at Advent has historically
met the annual compensation limit of Section 162(m), and our CEOs
compensation was within the $1 million limit in 2006..

(1)             Stock awards consist of RSUs. Amounts
shown do not reflect compensation actually received by the named executive
officer. Instead, the amounts in the Stock Awards column reflect the dollar
amounts recognized for financial statement reporting purposes for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2006, in accordance with SFAS 123R (excluding the
impact of estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions).
These compensation costs reflect stock awards granted only in fiscal 2006 as no
RSUs were granted prior to 2006. Excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures
related to service-based vesting conditions, assumptions made in the
calculation of these amounts are included in Note 9, Stock Based
Compensation to the Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2006, included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 3, 2007..



.

(2)             Option awards consist of stock option, SAR
and Employee Stock Purchase Plan awards. Amounts shown do not reflect
compensation actually received by the named executive officer. Instead, the
amounts in the Option Awards column reflect the dollar amounts recognized for
financial statement reporting purposes for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2006, in accordance with SFAS 123R (excluding the impact of estimated
forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions), and include amounts
attributable to awards granted during and before 2006. Excluding the impact of
estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions, assumptions
made in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 9, Stock
Based Compensation to the Companys consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, included in the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on April 3, 2007..



.

(3)             Amounts consist of bonuses earned for
services rendered in fiscal 2006 under the 2006 Executive Short-Term Incentive
Plan and paid in February 2007..



.

(4)             All other compensation primarily consists
of premiums paid for life insurance where the Company is not the beneficiary,
compensation for sales achievement, matching contributions made by Advent under
the tax-qualified 401(k) Plan, which provides for broad-based employee
participation, amounts paid for health care, parking benefits and health club

disability..



.

(3)                Executives receive 12 months vesting acceleration on
outstanding equity awards for involuntary termination unrelated to a
change-of-control and 30 months vesting acceleration for termination related to
a change-of-control. Calculations are based on outstanding equity awards as of December 31,
2006 and a year-end stock price of $35.29..



.

(4)                Under the Plan, executives do not receive any gross-up
payments; parachute payments under Section 280G are either delivered in
full or delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of
the severance benefits being subject to excise tax under Section 4999,
whichever provides the best after-tax result to the executive. As of December 31,
2006, Ms. DiMarco is the only executive with severance payments exceeding
the Section 280G safe harbor. Her best after-tax result is to reduce her
severance by approximately $80,000 so that her parachute payments do not exceed
the Section 280G limits..

Our 1998 Non-statutory
Stock Option Plan, which was not subject to stockholder approval, was adopted
in 1998. On February 26, 2007, the Board terminated the 1998 Non-Statutory
Stock Option Plan. This plan permitted the grant of options to purchase up to
300,000 shares to be granted to eligible employees. Officers and members of the
Board of Directors were not eligible to participate in this plan. The plan was
intended to help the Company attract and retain outstanding individuals in
order to promote the Companys success. Only non-statutory stock options were
able to be granted under the plan. The plan was administered by the Board of
Directors. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained
in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31,
2006, for a further description of the terms of the plan..

POLICIES AND
PROCEDURES WITH RESPECT TO RELATED PARTY INFORMATION.



.

The Board is committed to upholding the highest legal
and ethical conduct in fulfilling its responsibilities and recognizes that
related party transactions can present a heightened risk of potential or actual
conflicts of interest. Accordingly, as a general matter, it is Advents
preference to avoid related party transactions..



.

Advents Audit Committee Charter requires that members
of the Audit Committee, all of whom are independent directors, review and
approve all related party transactions for which such approval is required
under applicable law, including SEC and Nasdaq rules. For purposes of this
section, related person and transaction have the meanings contained in
Item 404 of Regulation S-K. .



.

In addition, the Audit Committee is responsible for
reviewing and investigating any matters pertaining to the integrity of
management, including conflicts of interest and adherence to Advents Code of
Business Ethics and Conduct. Under the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct,
directors, officers and all other members of the workforce are expected to
avoid any relationship, influence or activity that would cause or even appear
to cause a conflict of interest. Advents Corporate Goverance Principles
require a director to promptly disclose the Board any potential or actual
conflict of interest involving him or her. Under the Principles, the Board will
determine an appropriate resolution on a case-by-case basis. All directors must
recuse themselves from any discussion or decision affecting their personal,
business or professional interests..



.

All related party
transactions shall be disclosed in Advents applicable filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as required under SEC rules..



.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL
OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE.



.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (Section 16(a))
requires the Companys officers and directors, and persons who own more than

reports of ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or Form 5
with the SEC. Such officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders are also
required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all such forms
that they file..



.

Other than as provided in
this proxy statement, based solely on its review of the copies of such forms
received by the Company, or written representations from certain reporting
persons that all Forms required for such persons were filed, the Company
believes that during 2006 all Section 16(a) filing requirements
applicable to its officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders were
complied with..

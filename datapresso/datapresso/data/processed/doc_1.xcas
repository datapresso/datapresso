 &#13;
BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES&#13;
 &#13;
  The Board of Directors held a total of six meetings (including regularly&#13;
scheduled and special meetings) during fiscal 1996. No incumbent director&#13;
during the last fiscal year, while a member of the Board of Directors,&#13;
attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings&#13;
of the Board of Directors and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all&#13;
committees on which such director served.&#13;
 &#13;
  The Board of Directors of the Company has two standing committees: an Audit&#13;
Committee and a Compensation Committee. It does not have a nominating&#13;
committee or a committee performing the functions of a nominating committee.&#13;
 &#13;
  The Audit Committee, which currently consists of Maurice J. Duca, Mr.&#13;
Robinson and Mr. Van Auken, is responsible for (i) recommending engagement of&#13;
the Company's independent auditors, (ii) approving the services performed by&#13;
such auditors, (iii) consulting with such auditors and reviewing with them the&#13;
results of their examination, (iv) reviewing and approving any material&#13;
accounting policy changes affecting the Company's&#13;
 &#13;
                                       2&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
operating results, (v) reviewing the Company's control procedures and&#13;
personnel, and (vi) reviewing and evaluating the Company's accounting&#13;
principles and its system of internal accounting controls. The Audit Committee&#13;
held one meeting during fiscal 1996.&#13;
 &#13;
  The Compensation Committee, which currently consists of Messrs. Duca,&#13;
Robinson and Van Auken, is responsible for (i) reviewing and approving the&#13;
compensation and benefits for the Company's officers and other employees, (ii)&#13;
administering the Company's stock purchase and stock option plans, and (iii)&#13;
making recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding such matters. The&#13;
Compensation Committee held one meeting during fiscal 1996.&#13;
 &#13;
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS&#13;
 &#13;
  Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive additional&#13;
compensation for their services as directors of the Company. However,&#13;
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors receive an annual cash retainer&#13;
of $5,000 and $1,250 for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors&#13;
or any committee thereof.&#13;
 &#13;
  In addition, nonemployee directors participate in the Company's 1995&#13;
Director Option Plan (the "Director Plan"). The Director Plan was approved by&#13;
the Board in October 1995 and was ratified by stockholders in November 1995,&#13;
at which time a total of 75,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for&#13;
issuance thereunder. As of March 28, 1997, there were 36,000 options&#13;
outstanding under the Director Plan. The Director Plan became effective on the&#13;
date of the Company's initial public offering on November 15, 1995, and is&#13;
currently administered by the Board of Directors. Under the Director Plan,&#13;
each nonemployee director is automatically granted a non-qualified option to&#13;
purchase 10,000 shares on the date upon which such person first becomes a&#13;
director (the "Initial Option") with an exercise price equal to the fair&#13;
market value of the Company's Common Stock as of the date of grant.&#13;
Thereafter, each nonemployee director is automatically granted an option to&#13;
purchase 2,000 shares of Common Stock on December 1 of each year, except in&#13;
the year the Director Plan was adopted ("Subsequent Option"), provided he or&#13;
she has served as a director for at least six months as of such date.&#13;
 &#13;
  Options granted under the Director Plan have a term of ten years unless&#13;
terminated sooner upon termination of the optionee's status as a director or&#13;
otherwise pursuant to the Director Plan. Such options are transferable by the&#13;
optionee only in certain limited circumstances and each option is exercisable&#13;
during the lifetime of the director only by such director or a permitted&#13;
transferee. Initial Options granted under the Director Plan vest as to 20% of&#13;
the shares on the first anniversary date of grant and as to the remaining&#13;
shares, ratably each month over the ensuing four years. Subsequent Options&#13;
begin to vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant and vest ratably&#13;
each month over the next 12 month period. During 1996, no director was granted&#13;
an Initial Option. The Director Plan is designed to work automatically,&#13;
without administration; however, to the extent administration is necessary,&#13;
the Director Plan has been structured so that options granted to nonemployee&#13;
directors who administer the Company's other employee benefit plans shall&#13;
qualify as transactions exempt from Section 16(b) of the Securities and&#13;
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), pursuant to Rule 16b-3&#13;
promulgated thereunder.&#13;
 &#13;
REQUIRED VOTE&#13;
 &#13;
  The three nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the&#13;
shares present or represented and entitled to be voted for them shall be&#13;
elected as directors. Votes withheld from any director are counted for&#13;
purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the&#13;
transaction of business, but they have no legal effect under Delaware law.&#13;
 &#13;
          MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE NOMINEES LISTED ABOVE.&#13;

 &#13;
                    APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S&#13;
                                1992 STOCK PLAN&#13;
 &#13;
GENERAL&#13;
 &#13;
  The 1992 Stock Plan as amended (the "Option Plan") was adopted by the Board&#13;
of Directors and approved by the stockholders in August 1992. In March 1997,&#13;
the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Option Plan to increase&#13;
the number of shares reserved for issuance thereunder by an additional 600,000&#13;
shares. There are currently 1,688,000 shares of Common Stock reserved for&#13;
issuance under the Option Plan. The Option Plan provides for the grant to&#13;
employees of the Company of incentive stock options within the meaning of&#13;
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for&#13;
the grant of nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights to employees&#13;
and consultants of the Company. The Option Plan may be administered by the&#13;
Board or a committee approved by the Board. As of March 28, 1997, options to&#13;
purchase 1,153,000 shares were outstanding under the Option Plan and 93,000&#13;
shares remained available for future grants (without giving effect to the&#13;
March 1997 amendment).&#13;
 &#13;
PROPOSAL&#13;
 &#13;
  At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders are being requested to approve the&#13;
amendment approved by the Board of Directors in March 1997 to the Option Plan&#13;
to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance thereunder by 600,000&#13;
shares for an aggregate of 2,288,000 shares reserved for issuance thereunder.&#13;
The amendment to increase the number of shares reserved under the Option Plan&#13;
is proposed in order to give the Board of Directors greater flexibility to&#13;
grant stock options and stock purchase rights. The Company believes that&#13;
granting stock options motivates high levels of performance and provides an&#13;
effective means of recognizing employee contributions to the success of the&#13;
Company. The Company believes that this policy is of great value in recruiting&#13;
and retaining highly qualified technical and other key personnel who are in&#13;
great demand as well as rewarding and incenting current employees. The Board&#13;
of Directors believes that the ability to grant options and stock purchase&#13;
rights will be important to the future success of the Company by allowing it&#13;
to accomplish these objectives.&#13;
 &#13;
SUMMARY OF THE OPTION PLAN&#13;
 &#13;
  Certain features of the Option Plan are outlined below.&#13;
 &#13;
  Administration. The Option Plan may be administered by the Board or a&#13;
committee of the Board (the "Administrator"), which committee is required to&#13;
be constituted to comply with Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act and applicable&#13;
laws. Subject to the other provisions of the Option Plan, the Administrator&#13;
has the power to determine the terms of any options and stock purchase rights&#13;
granted, including the exercise price, the number of shares subject to the&#13;
option or stock purchase right and the exercisability thereof. The Option Plan&#13;
is currently administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of&#13;
Directors.&#13;
 &#13;
  Eligibility and Terms of Options. The Option Plan provides that nonstatutory&#13;
stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted only to employees and&#13;
consultants. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees. An&#13;
optionee who has been granted an option may, if he or she is otherwise&#13;
eligible, be granted additional options or stock purchase rights. With respect&#13;
to any optionee who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the voting power of&#13;
all classes of stock of the Company (a "10% Stockholder"), the exercise price&#13;
of any incentive stock option granted must equal at least 110% of the fair&#13;
market value on the grant date and the maximum term of the option must not&#13;
exceed five years. The term of all other options under the Option Plan may not&#13;
exceed ten years. The Administrator selects the optionees and determines the&#13;
number of shares to be subject to each option. In making such determination,&#13;
there is taken into account the duties and responsibilities of the employee or&#13;
consultant, the value of his or her services, his or her present and potential&#13;
contribution to the success of the Company, the anticipated number of years of&#13;
future service and other relevant factors.&#13;
 &#13;
                                       4&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
  Terms and Conditions of Options. Each option granted under the Option Plan&#13;
is evidenced by a written stock option agreement between the optionee and the&#13;
Company and is subject to the following terms and conditions:&#13;
 &#13;
    (a) Exercise Price. The Administrator determines the exercise price of&#13;
  options to purchase shares of Common Stock at the time the options are&#13;
  granted. However, the exercise price of an incentive stock option must not&#13;
  be less than 100% (110% if issued to a 10% Stockholder) of the fair market&#13;
  value of the Common Stock on the date the option is granted. For so long as&#13;
  the Company's Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market, the&#13;
  fair market value of a share of Common Stock shall be the closing sale&#13;
  price for such stock (or the closing bid if no sales were reported) as&#13;
  quoted on the Nasdaq National Market on the date the option is granted.&#13;
 &#13;
    (b) Exercise of the Option. Each stock option agreement will specify the&#13;
  term of the option and the date when the option is to become exercisable.&#13;
  The terms of such vesting are determined by the Administrator. Options&#13;
  granted under the Option Plan have a ten-year term and to date generally&#13;
  become exercisable over five years at a rate of one-fifth of the shares&#13;
  subject to the options at the end of one year from the date of grant and&#13;
  1/60th each month thereafter. An option is exercised by giving written&#13;
  notice of exercise to the Company, specifying the number of full shares of&#13;
  Common Stock to be purchased and by tendering full payment of the purchase&#13;
  price to the Company.&#13;
 &#13;
    (c) Form of Consideration. The consideration to be paid for the shares of&#13;
  Common Stock issued upon exercise of an option shall be determined by the&#13;
  Administrator and is set forth in the option agreement. Such form of&#13;
  consideration may vary for each option, and may consist entirely of cash,&#13;
  check, promissory note, other shares of the Company's Common Stock meeting&#13;
  certain criteria, any combination thereof, or any other legally permissible&#13;
  form of consideration as may be provided in the Option Plan or the option&#13;
  agreement.&#13;
 &#13;
    (d) Termination of Employment. In the event an optionee's continuous&#13;
  status as an employee or consultant terminates for any reason (other than&#13;
  upon the optionee's death or disability), the optionee may exercise his or&#13;
  her option to the extent that the optionee was entitled to exercise it at&#13;
  the date of such termination, but only within such period of time set forth&#13;
  in the option agreement (not to exceed three months in the case of an&#13;
  incentive stock option) from the date of such termination (and in no event&#13;
  later than the expiration of the term of such option as set forth in the&#13;
  option agreement). If no period of time is specified in the option&#13;
  agreement, the optionee may exercise his or her option for three months&#13;
  following the date of such termination, subject to the same limitations set&#13;
  forth above. Options granted under the Option Plan to date have generally&#13;
  provided that optionees may exercise their options within ninety days from&#13;
  the date of termination of employment (other than for death or disability).&#13;
 &#13;
    (e) Disability. In the event an optionee's continuous status as an&#13;
  employee or consultant terminates as a result of permanent and total&#13;
  disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), the optionee may&#13;
  exercise his or her option to the extent that the optionee was entitled to&#13;
  exercise it at the date of such termination, within twelve months from the&#13;
  date of such termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the&#13;
  term of such option as set forth in the option agreement).&#13;
 &#13;
    (f) Death. In the event of an optionee's death, the optionee's estate or&#13;
  a person who acquired the right to exercise the deceased optionee's option&#13;
  by bequest or inheritance may exercise the option to the extent that the&#13;
  optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of death, within twelve&#13;
  months following the date of death (but in no event later than the&#13;
  expiration of the term of such option as set forth in the option&#13;
  agreement).&#13;
 &#13;
    (g) Termination of Options. Excluding incentive stock options issued to&#13;
  10% Stockholders, options granted under the Option Plan expire on the date&#13;
  set forth in the option agreement (not to exceed ten years from the date of&#13;
  grant). Incentive stock options granted to 10% Stockholders expire five&#13;
  years from the date of grant (or such shorter period set forth in the&#13;
  option agreement). No option may be exercised by any person after the&#13;
  expiration of its term.&#13;
 &#13;
                                       5&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
    (h) Nontransferability of Options. An option is nontransferable by the&#13;
  optionee, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and&#13;
  is exercisable during the optionee's lifetime only by the optionee. In the&#13;
  event of the optionee's death, options may be exercised by a person who&#13;
  acquires the right to exercise the option by bequest or inheritance.&#13;
 &#13;
    (i) Value Limitation. If the aggregate fair market value of all shares of&#13;
  Common Stock subject to an optionee's incentive stock option which are&#13;
  exercisable for the first time during any calendar year exceeds $100,000,&#13;
  the excess options shall be treated as nonstatutory options.&#13;
 &#13;
    (j) Other Provisions. The stock option agreement may contain such other&#13;
  terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Option Plan as&#13;
  may be determined by the Administrator.&#13;
 &#13;
  Terms and Conditions of Stock Purchase Rights. Each stock purchase right&#13;
granted under the Option Plan shall be evidenced by a written offer which sets&#13;
forth the terms, conditions and restrictions related to the offer, including&#13;
the number of shares subject to the offer, the price per share, and the time&#13;
in which the offeree must accept the offer (which may not exceed ninety days&#13;
from the date the Administrator granted the stock purchase right). The offer&#13;
must be accepted by executing a purchase agreement with such terms and&#13;
conditions as determined by the Administrator. The stock purchased pursuant to&#13;
a stock purchase right shall be subject to a repurchase option (unless the&#13;
Administrator determines otherwise) upon any termination of the purchaser's&#13;
employment with the Company (including termination as a result of death or&#13;
disability). Pursuant to such repurchase option, the Company shall be able to&#13;
repurchase any shares of stock as to which the repurchase option has not&#13;
lapsed at the price per share originally paid by the purchaser. The&#13;
Administrator shall determine the rate at which the repurchase option lapses.&#13;
A purchaser of stock pursuant to a stock purchase right shall the rights&#13;
equivalent to those of a stockholder.&#13;
 &#13;
  Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization; Corporate Transactions. In the&#13;
event of changes in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of&#13;
any stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, mergers,&#13;
recapitalizations or other change in the capital structure of the Company, an&#13;
appropriate adjustment shall be made by the Administrator in the following:&#13;
(i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option Plan, (ii) the&#13;
number and class of shares of stock subject to any option or stock purchase&#13;
right outstanding under the Option Plan, (iii) and the exercise price of any&#13;
such outstanding option or stock purchase right. The determination of the&#13;
Administrator as to which adjustments shall be made shall be conclusive. In&#13;
the event of a proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all&#13;
outstanding options will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of&#13;
such proposed action. The Board of Directors in its sole discretion may in&#13;
such circumstances declare that any outstanding option or stock purchase right&#13;
shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board of Directors and give each&#13;
optionee the right to exercise his or her option or stock purchase right,&#13;
including as to shares for which the option or stock purchase right would not&#13;
otherwise be exercisable.&#13;
 &#13;
  Merger or Asset Sale. In the event of a merger of the Company with or into&#13;
another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the&#13;
Company, each outstanding option or stock purchase right will be assumed or an&#13;
equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a&#13;
parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the&#13;
successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the option or stock&#13;
purchase right, the optionee shall have the right to exercise the option or&#13;
stock purchase right as to all of the optioned stock, including shares as to&#13;
which it would not otherwise be exercisable.&#13;
 &#13;
  Amendment and Termination of the Option Plan. The Board may at any time&#13;
amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Option Plan. The Company shall obtain&#13;
stockholder approval of any amendment to the Option Plan in such a manner and&#13;
to such a degree as is necessary and desirable to comply with Rule 16b-3 under&#13;
the Exchange Act or Section 422 of the Code (or any other applicable law or&#13;
regulation, including the requirements of any exchange or quotation system on&#13;
which the Common Stock is traded). Any amendment or termination of the Option&#13;
Plan shall not affect options already granted and such options shall remain in&#13;
full force and effect as if the Option Plan had not been amended or&#13;
terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the optionee and the&#13;
Company, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the optionee and the&#13;
Company. In any event, the Option Plan shall terminate in August 2002. Any&#13;
options outstanding under the Option Plan at the time of its termination shall&#13;
remain outstanding until they expire by their terms.&#13;
 &#13;
                                       6&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION&#13;
 &#13;
  Options granted under the Option Plan may be either "incentive stock&#13;
options," as defined in Section 422 of the Code, or nonstatutory options.&#13;
 &#13;
  An optionee who is granted an incentive stock option will not recognize&#13;
taxable income either at the time the option is granted or upon its exercise,&#13;
although the exercise may subject the optionee to the alternative minimum tax.&#13;
Upon the sale or exchange of the shares more than two years after grant of the&#13;
option and one year after exercising the option, any gain or loss will be&#13;
treated as long-term capital gain or loss. If these holding periods are not&#13;
satisfied, the optionee will recognize ordinary income at the time of sale or&#13;
exchange equal to the difference between the exercise price and the lower of&#13;
(i) the fair market value of the shares at the date of the option exercise or&#13;
(ii) the sale price of the shares. A different rule for measuring ordinary&#13;
income upon such a premature disposition may apply if the optionee is also an&#13;
officer, director, or 10% Stockholder of the Company. The Company will be&#13;
entitled to a deduction in the same amount as the ordinary income recognized&#13;
by the optionee. Any gain or loss recognized on such a premature disposition&#13;
of the shares in excess of the amount treated as ordinary income will be&#13;
characterized as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on&#13;
the holding period.&#13;
 &#13;
  All of the options which do not qualify as incentive stock options are&#13;
referred to as nonstatutory options. An optionee will not recognize any&#13;
taxable income at the time he is granted a nonstatutory option. However, upon&#13;
its exercise, the optionee will recognize taxable income generally measured as&#13;
the excess of the then fair market value of the shares purchased over the&#13;
purchase price. Any taxable income recognized in connection with an option&#13;
exercise by an optionee who is also an employee of the Company will be subject&#13;
to tax withholding by the Company. Upon resale of such shares by the optionee,&#13;
any difference between the sales price and the optionee's purchase price, to&#13;
the extent not recognized as taxable income as described above, will be&#13;
treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the&#13;
holding period.&#13;
 &#13;
  The Company will be entitled to a tax deduction in the same amount as the&#13;
ordinary income recognized by the optionee with respect to shares acquired&#13;
upon exercise of a nonstatutory option.&#13;
 &#13;
  The foregoing is only a summary of the effect of federal income taxation&#13;
upon the optionee and the Company with respect to the grant and exercise of&#13;
options under the Option Plan; it does not purport to be complete, and it does&#13;
not discuss the tax consequences of the optionee's death or the income tax&#13;
laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which an optionee may&#13;
reside.&#13;

REQUIRED VOTE&#13;
 &#13;
  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock&#13;
present or represented at the Annual Meeting is required to approve and ratify&#13;
the amendment to the Option Plan.&#13;
 &#13;
       THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THE&#13;
        OPTION PLAN. THE EFFECT OF AN ABSTENTION IS THE SAME AS A VOTE&#13;
                   AGAINST THE AMENDMENT OF THE OPTION PLAN.&#13;

 &#13;
              RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS&#13;
 &#13;
  The Board of Directors has selected Coopers &amp; Lybrand L.L.P., independent&#13;
auditors, to audit the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year&#13;
ending December 31, 1997. Coopers &amp; Lybrand L.L.P. has audited the Company's&#13;
financial statements since 1989. A representative of Coopers &amp; Lybrand L.L.P.&#13;
is expected to be present at the meeting, will have the opportunity to make a&#13;
statement, and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate&#13;
questions.&#13;
 &#13;
REQUIRED VOTE&#13;
 &#13;
  The Board of Directors has conditioned its appointment of the Company's&#13;
independent auditors upon the receipt of the affirmative vote of a majority of&#13;
the shares represented, in person or by proxy, and voting at the Annual&#13;
Meeting, which shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority&#13;
of the required quorum. In the event that the stockholders do not approve the&#13;
selection of Coopers &amp; Lybrand L.L.P., the appointment of the independent&#13;
auditors will be reconsidered by the Board of Directors.&#13;
 &#13;
 THE  BOARD  OF DIRECTORS  RECOMMENDS  A VOTE  FOR  THE RATIFICATION  OF  THE&#13;
   APPOINTMENT OF  COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND,  L.L.P., AS INDEPENDENT  AUDITORS FOR&#13;
    FISCAL  YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 1997. THE EFFECT OF AN ABSTENTION  IS&#13;
      THE SAME AS A VOTE AGAINST  THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF&#13;
        THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS.&#13;
 &#13;
                                 OTHER MATTERS&#13;
 &#13;
  The Company knows of no other matters to be submitted to the meeting. If any&#13;
other matters properly come before the meeting, it is the intention of the&#13;
persons named in the enclosed proxy card to vote the shares they represent as&#13;
the Company may recommend.&#13;
 &#13;
  It is important that your shares be presented at the meeting, regardless of&#13;
the number of shares which you hold. You are, therefore, urged to execute and&#13;
return, at your earliest convenience, the accompanying proxy card in the&#13;
envelope which has been enclosed.&#13;

               COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT&#13;
 &#13;
  Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act ("Section 16(a)") requires the Company's&#13;
officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a&#13;
registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of&#13;
ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or Form 5 with the&#13;
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the National Association of&#13;
Securities Dealers, Inc. Such officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders&#13;
are also required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all such&#13;
forms that they file.&#13;
 &#13;
  Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by the&#13;
Company, or written representations from certain reporting persons that all&#13;
Forms 5 required for such persons were filed, the Company believes that during&#13;
fiscal 1996 all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers,&#13;
directors and ten-percent stockholders were complied with, except that Mr.&#13;
Duca filed a Form 4 late covering two transactions.&#13;

(1) All options in this table are incentive stock options and were granted&#13;
    under the 1992 Stock Option Plan and have exercise prices equal to the&#13;
    fair market value on the date of grant. All such options have ten-year&#13;
    terms and vest over a five-year period at the rate of one-fifth at the end&#13;
    of one year from the date of grant and 1/60th each month thereafter.&#13;
 &#13;
(2) The Company granted options to purchase 412,000 shares of Common Stock to&#13;
    employees in fiscal 1996.&#13;
 &#13;
(3) Options may terminate before their expiration upon the termination of&#13;
    optionee's status as an employee or consultant, the optionee's death or an&#13;
    acquisition of the Company.&#13;
 &#13;
(4) Potential realizable value assumes that the stock price increases from the&#13;
    exercise price from the date of grant until the end of the option term (10&#13;
    years) at the annual rate specified (5% and 10%). Annual compounding&#13;
    results in total appreciation of approximately 62.9% (at 5% per year) and&#13;
    159.4% (at 10% per year). The assumed annual rates of appreciation are&#13;
    specified in SEC rules and do not represent the Company's estimate or&#13;
    projection of future stock price growth. The Company does not necessarily&#13;
    agree that this method can properly determine the value of an option.&#13;

        REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS&#13;
 &#13;
  The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee")&#13;
consists of directors Maurice J. Duca, Wendell G. Van Auken and Frank H.&#13;
Robinson, none of whom is an employee or officer of the Company. The Committee&#13;
sets policy and administers the Company's cash and equity incentive programs&#13;
for the purpose of attracting and retaining highly skilled executives who will&#13;
promote the Company's business goals and build long-term stockholder value.&#13;
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to&#13;
the Board of Directors regarding all forms of compensation to be provided to&#13;
the executive officers and directors of the Company, including stock&#13;
compensation and loans, and all bonus and stock compensation to all employees.&#13;
 &#13;
  To the extent appropriate, the Company intends to take the necessary steps&#13;
to conform its compensation practices to comply with the $1 million&#13;
compensation deduction cap under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code&#13;
of 1986, as amended.&#13;
 &#13;
 Compensation Philosophy and Policies&#13;
 &#13;
  The policy of the Committee is to attract and retain key personnel through&#13;
the payment of competitive base salaries and to encourage and reward&#13;
performance through bonuses and stock ownership. The Committee's objectives&#13;
are to:&#13;
 &#13;
  . ensure that there is an appropriate relationship between executive&#13;
    compensation and the creation of stockholder value;&#13;
 &#13;
  . ensure that the total compensation program will motivate, retain and&#13;
    attract executives of outstanding abilities; and&#13;
 &#13;
  . ensure that current cash and equity incentive opportunities are&#13;
    competitive with comparable companies.&#13;
 &#13;
 Elements of Compensation&#13;
 &#13;
  Compensation for officers and key employees includes both cash and equity&#13;
elements.&#13;
 &#13;
  Cash compensation consists of base salary, which is determined on the basis&#13;
of the level of responsibility, expertise and experience of the employee, and&#13;
competitive conditions in the industry. The Committee believes that the&#13;
salaries of its officers fall within the software industry norm. In addition,&#13;
cash bonuses may be awarded to officers and other key employees; however, no&#13;
executive officer received a cash bonus in 1996. Compensation of sales&#13;
personnel also includes sales commissions tied to quarterly targets.&#13;
 &#13;
  Ownership of the Company's Common Stock is a key element of executive&#13;
compensation. Officers and other employees of the Company are eligible to&#13;
participate in the 1992 Stock Plan (the "Option Plan") and the 1995 Employee&#13;
Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan"), which were adopted prior to the&#13;
Company's initial public offering in November 1995. The Option Plan permits&#13;
the Board of Directors or the Committee to grant stock options to employees on&#13;
such terms as the Board or the Committee may determine. The Committee has the&#13;
sole authority to grant stock options to executive officers of the Company and&#13;
is currently administering stock option grants to all employees. In&#13;
determining the size of a stock option grant to a new officer or other key&#13;
employee, the Committee takes into account equity participation by comparable&#13;
employees within the Company, external competitive circumstances and other&#13;
relevant factors. Additional options may be granted to current employees to&#13;
reward exceptional performance or to provide additional unvested equity&#13;
incentives. The Purchase Plan permits employees to acquire Common Stock of the&#13;
Company through payroll deductions and promotes broad-based equity&#13;
participation throughout the Company. The Committee believes that such stock&#13;
plans align the interests of the employees with the long-term interests of the&#13;
stockholders.&#13;
 &#13;
  The Company also maintains a 401(k) Plan to provide retirement benefits&#13;
through tax deferred salary deductions for all its employees. The Company&#13;
matches up to 50% of an employee's contribution, not to exceed $500 per&#13;
employee.&#13;
 &#13;

 &#13;
 1996 Executive Compensation&#13;
 &#13;
  Executive compensation for 1996 included base salary and, in the case of&#13;
sales executives, sales commissions. Executive officers, like other employees,&#13;
were eligible for option grants under the Option Plan. Prior to the Company's&#13;
initial public offering in November 1995, the Board of Directors, consistent&#13;
with the Company's status as a privately-held corporation, took primary&#13;
responsibility for establishing and administering the Company's executive&#13;
compensation policies. For 1996, the Company also implemented a profit sharing&#13;
plan for its employees.&#13;

Rights.&#13;
&#13;
     5.     Eligibility.&#13;
            ----------- &#13;
&#13;
            (a)  Nonstatutory Stock Options and Stock Purchase Rights may be&#13;
granted to Employees and Consultants. Incentive Stock Options may be granted&#13;
only to Employees. An Employee or Consultant who has been granted an Option or&#13;
Stock Purchase Right may, if he or she is otherwise eligible, be granted&#13;
additional Options or Stock Purchase Rights.&#13;
&#13;
            (b)  Each Option shall be designated in the written option agreement&#13;
as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However,&#13;
notwithstanding such designa tions, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market&#13;
Value of the Shares with respect to which Options &#13;
&#13;
                                      -5-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any&#13;
Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company or any Parent&#13;
or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be treated as&#13;
Nonstatutory Stock Options.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            (c)  For purposes of Section 5(b), Incentive Stock Options shall be&#13;
taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market&#13;
Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect&#13;
to such Shares is granted.&#13;
&#13;
            (d)  The Plan shall not confer upon any Optionee any right with&#13;
respect to continuation of employment or consulting relationship with the&#13;
Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with his or her right or the&#13;
Company's right to terminate his or her employment or consulting relationship at&#13;
any time, with or without cause.&#13;
&#13;
            (e)   The following limitations shall apply to grants of&#13;
Options and Stock Purchase Rights to Employees:&#13;
&#13;
                  (i)     No Employee shall be granted, in any fiscal year of&#13;
the Company, Options and Stock Purchase Rights to purchase more than 150,000&#13;
Shares.&#13;
&#13;
                  (ii)    In connection with his or her initial employment, an&#13;
Employee may be granted Options and Stock Purchase Rights to purchase up to an&#13;
additional 150,000 Shares which shall not count against the limit set forth in&#13;
subsection (i) above.&#13;
&#13;
                  (iii)   The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted&#13;
proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as&#13;
described in Section 12.&#13;
&#13;
                  (iv)    If an Option or Stock Purchase Right is cancelled in&#13;
the same fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in&#13;
connection with a transaction described in Section 12), the cancelled Option or&#13;
Stock Purchase Right will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections&#13;
(i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option or&#13;
Stock Purchase Right is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a&#13;
cancellation of the Option or Stock Purchase Right and the grant of a new Option&#13;
or Stock Purchase Right.&#13;
&#13;
     6.     Term of Plan.  The Plan shall become effective upon the earlier to&#13;
            ------------                                                      &#13;
occur of its adoption by the Board of Directors or its approval by the&#13;
stockholders of the Company as described in Section 18 of the Plan.  It shall&#13;
continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless sooner terminated under&#13;
Section 14 of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
     7.     Term of Option.  The term of each Option shall be the term stated in&#13;
            --------------                                                      &#13;
the Option Agreement; provided, however, that the term shall be no more than ten&#13;
(10) years from the date of grant thereof.  However, in the case of an Incentive&#13;
Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns&#13;
stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all&#13;
classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of such&#13;
Option shall be &#13;
&#13;
                                      -6-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
five (5) years from the date of grant thereof or such shorter term as may be&#13;
provided in the Option Agreement.&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
     8.     Option Exercise Price and Consideration.&#13;
            --------------------------------------- &#13;
&#13;
            (a)  The per Share exercise price for the Shares to be issued&#13;
pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall be such price as is determined by&#13;
the Administrator, but shall be subject to the following:&#13;
&#13;
                  (i)     In the case of an Incentive Stock Option&#13;
&#13;
                          (A)  granted to an Employee who, at the time of the&#13;
grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns stock representing more than ten&#13;
percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any&#13;
Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of&#13;
the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.&#13;
&#13;
                          (B)  granted to any other Employee, the per Share&#13;
exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on&#13;
the date of grant.&#13;
&#13;
                  (ii)    In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per&#13;
Share exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator.&#13;
&#13;
            (b)  Form of Consideration.  The Administrator shall determine the&#13;
                 --------------------- &#13;
acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method&#13;
of payment.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall&#13;
determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant.  Such&#13;
consideration may consist entirely of:&#13;
&#13;
                  (i)     cash;&#13;
&#13;
                  (ii)    check;&#13;
&#13;
                  (iii)   promissory note;&#13;
&#13;
                  (iv)    other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired&#13;
upon exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six&#13;
months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of&#13;
surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said&#13;
Option shall be exercised;&#13;
&#13;
                  (v)     delivery of a properly executed exercise notice&#13;
together with such other documentation as the Administrator and the broker, if&#13;
applicable, shall require to effect an exercise of the Option and delivery to&#13;
the Company of the sale or loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price;&#13;
&#13;
                  (vi)    a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to&#13;
the Optionee, &#13;
&#13;
                                      -7-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
including any liability attributable to the Optionee's participation in any&#13;
Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                  (vii)   any combination of the foregoing methods of payment;&#13;
or&#13;
&#13;
                  (viii)  such other consideration and method of payment for the&#13;
issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.&#13;
&#13;
     9.     Exercise of Option.&#13;
            ------------------ &#13;
&#13;
            (a)  Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder. Any Option&#13;
granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions&#13;
as determined by the Administrator, including performance criteria with respect&#13;
to the Company and/or the Optionee, and as shall be permissible under the terms&#13;
of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
                 An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.&#13;
&#13;
                 An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when written notice&#13;
of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of&#13;
the Option by the person entitled to exercise the Option and full payment for&#13;
the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been received by&#13;
the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Administrator, consist of&#13;
any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(b) of the&#13;
Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of&#13;
the Company or of a duly autho rized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock&#13;
certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any&#13;
other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock,&#13;
notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to&#13;
be issued) such stock certificate promptly upon exercise of the Option. No&#13;
adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date&#13;
is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in&#13;
Section 12 of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
                 Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a decrease&#13;
in the number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of&#13;
the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the&#13;
Option is exercised.&#13;
&#13;
            (b)  Termination of Employment or Consulting Relationship.  Upon&#13;
                 ----------------------------------------------------&#13;
termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant,&#13;
other than upon the Optionee's death or Disability, the Optionee may exercise&#13;
his or her Option, but only within such period of time as is specified in the&#13;
Notice of Grant, and only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to&#13;
exercise it at the date of termination (but in no event later than the&#13;
expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant).  In&#13;
the absence of a specified time in the Notice of Grant, the Option shall remain&#13;
exercisable for three (3) months following the Optionee's termination.  In the&#13;
case of an Incentive Stock Option, such period of time for exercise shall not&#13;
exceed three (3) months from the date of termination.  If, on the date of&#13;
termination, the Optionee &#13;
&#13;
                                      -8-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
is not entitled to exercise the Optionee's entire Option, the Shares covered by&#13;
the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after&#13;
termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time&#13;
specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares&#13;
covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
                 Notwithstanding the above, in the event of an Optionee's change&#13;
in status from Consultant to Employee or Employee to Consultant, the Optionee's&#13;
Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant shall not automatically terminate&#13;
solely as a result of such change in status. However, in such event, an&#13;
Incentive Stock Option held by the Optionee shall cease to be treated as an&#13;
Incentive Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory&#13;
Stock Option three months and one day following such change of status.&#13;
&#13;
            c.     Disability of Optionee. In the event that an Optionee's&#13;
                   ----------------------&#13;
Continuous Status as an Employee or Consultant terminates as a result of the&#13;
Optionee's Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option at any time&#13;
within twelve (12) months from the date of such termination, but only to the&#13;
extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of such&#13;
termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such&#13;
Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant). If, at the date of termination, the&#13;
Optionee is not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option, the Shares&#13;
covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If,&#13;
after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the&#13;
time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by&#13;
such Option shall revert to the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
            d.     Death of Optionee. In the event of the death of an Optionee,&#13;
                   -----------------&#13;
the Option may be exercised at any time within twelve (12) months following the&#13;
date of death (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such&#13;
Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant), by the Optionee's estate or by a&#13;
person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance,&#13;
but only to the extent that the Optionee was entitled to exercise the Option at&#13;
the date of death. If, at the time of death, the Optionee was not entitled to&#13;
exercise his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unexercisable&#13;
portion of the Option shall immediately revert to the Plan. If, after death, the&#13;
Optionee's estate or a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by&#13;
bequest or inheritance does not exercise the Option within the time specified&#13;
herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall&#13;
revert to the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
            e.     Buyout Provisions. The Administrator may at any time offer to&#13;
                   -----------------&#13;
buy out for a payment in cash or Shares, an Option previously granted, based on&#13;
such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate&#13;
to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.&#13;
&#13;
            f.     Rule 16b-3. Options granted to individuals subject to Section&#13;
                   ----------&#13;
16 of the Exchange Act ("Insiders") must comply with the applicable provisions&#13;
of Rule 16b-3 and shall contain such additional conditions or restrictions as&#13;
may be required thereunder to qualify for the maximum exemption from Section 16&#13;
of the Exchange Act with respect to Plan transactions.&#13;
&#13;
     10.    Non-Transferability of Options. The Option may not be sold, pledged,&#13;
            ------------------------------&#13;
assigned, &#13;
&#13;
                                      -9-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by&#13;
the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of&#13;
the Optionee, only by the Optionee.&#13;
&#13;
     11.    Stock Purchase Rights.&#13;
            --------------------- &#13;
&#13;
            (a)  Rights to Purchase. Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either&#13;
                 ------------------&#13;
alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan&#13;
and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator determines&#13;
that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall advise the&#13;
offeree in writing of the terms, conditions and restrictions related to the&#13;
offer, including the number of Shares that such person shall be entitled to&#13;
purchase, the price to be paid and the time within which such person must accept&#13;
such offer, which shall in no event exceed ninety (90) days from the date upon&#13;
which the Administrator made the determination to grant the Stock Purchase&#13;
Right. The offer shall be accepted by execution of a purchase agreement (the&#13;
"Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement") in the form determined by the&#13;
Administrator. Shares purchased pursuant to the grant of a Stock Purchase Right&#13;
shall be referred to herein as "Restricted Stock".&#13;
&#13;
            (b)  Repurchase Option. Unless the Administrator determines&#13;
                 ----------------- &#13;
otherwise, the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall grant the Company a&#13;
repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of&#13;
the purchaser's employment with the Company for any reason (including death or&#13;
Disability). The purchase price for Shares repurchased pursuant to the&#13;
Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall be the original price paid by the&#13;
purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of the purchaser&#13;
to the Company. The repurchase option shall lapse at such rate as the&#13;
Administrator may determine.&#13;
&#13;
            (c)  Other Provisions. The Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall&#13;
                 ----------------&#13;
contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the&#13;
Plan as may be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. In&#13;
addition, the provisions of Restricted Stock purchase agreements need not be the&#13;
same with respect to each purchaser.&#13;
&#13;
            (d)  Rights as a Stockholder. Once the Stock Purchase Right is&#13;
                 -----------------------&#13;
exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a&#13;
stockholder, and shall be a stockholder when his or her purchase is entered upon&#13;
the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. No adjustment&#13;
will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to&#13;
the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as provided in Section 12&#13;
of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
            (e)  Rule 16b-3. Stock Purchase Rights granted to Insiders, and&#13;
                 ----------&#13;
Shares purchased by Insiders in connection with Stock Purchase Rights, shall be&#13;
subject to any restrictions applicable thereto in compliance with Rule 16b-3. An&#13;
Insider may only purchase Shares pursuant to the grant of a Stock Purchase&#13;
Right, and may only sell Shares purchased pursuant to the grant of a Stock&#13;
Purchase Right, during such time or times as are permitted by Rule 16b-3.&#13;
&#13;
     12.     Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution or Merger.&#13;
             ----------------------------------------------------------------- &#13;
&#13;
                                     -10-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
            (a)  Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required action by&#13;
                 -------------------------&#13;
the stockholders of the Company, the number of shares of Common Stock covered by&#13;
each outstanding Option or Stock Purchase Right, and the number of shares of&#13;
Common Stock which have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to&#13;
which no Options or Stock Purchase Rights have yet been granted or which have&#13;
been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Option or Stock&#13;
Purchase Right, as well as the price per share of Common Stock covered by each&#13;
such outstanding Option or Stock Purchase Right, shall be proportionately&#13;
adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common&#13;
Stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,&#13;
combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or any other increase or&#13;
decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock effected without receipt&#13;
of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any&#13;
convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected&#13;
without receipt of consideration". Such adjustment shall be made by the&#13;
Administrator, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and&#13;
conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of&#13;
shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of&#13;
any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with&#13;
respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option&#13;
or Stock Purchase Right.&#13;
&#13;
            (b)  Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed&#13;
                 --------------------------&#13;
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, to the extent that an Option or Stock&#13;
Purchase Right has not been previously exercised, it will terminate immediately&#13;
prior to the consummation of such proposed action. The Board may, in the&#13;
exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option or&#13;
Stock Purchase Right shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give&#13;
each Optionee the right to exercise his or her Option or Stock Purchase Right as&#13;
to all or any part of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the&#13;
Option or Stock Purchase Right would not otherwise be exercisable.&#13;
&#13;
            (c)  Merger or Asset Sale. In the event of a merger of the Company&#13;
                 --------------------&#13;
with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets&#13;
of the Company, each outstanding Option and Stock Purchase Right shall be&#13;
assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor&#13;
corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event&#13;
that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or&#13;
Stock Purchase Right, Administrator shall have the discretion to allow the&#13;
Optionee to exercise the Option or Stock Purchase Right as to all of the&#13;
Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be&#13;
exercisable. If an Option or Stock Purchase Right is exercisable in lieu of&#13;
assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the&#13;
Administrator shall notify the Optionee that the Option or Stock Purchase Right&#13;
shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of&#13;
such notice, and the Option or Stock Purchase Right shall terminate upon the&#13;
expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or&#13;
Stock Purchase Right shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or&#13;
sale of assets, the option or right confers the right to purchase or receive,&#13;
for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option or Stock Purchase Right&#13;
immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the &#13;
&#13;
                                     -11-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in&#13;
the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on&#13;
the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of&#13;
consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of&#13;
the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received&#13;
in the merger or sale of assets was not solely common stock of the successor&#13;
corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the&#13;
successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the&#13;
exercise of the Option or Stock Purchase Right, for each Share of Optioned Stock&#13;
subject to the Option or Stock Purchase Right, to be solely common stock of the&#13;
successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share&#13;
consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of&#13;
assets.&#13;
&#13;
     13.    Date of Grant. The date of grant of an Option or Stock Purchase&#13;
            -------------&#13;
Right shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Administrator makes the&#13;
determination granting such Option or Stock Purchase Right, or such other date&#13;
as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the deter mination shall be&#13;
given to each Employee or Consultant to whom an Option or Stock Purchase Right&#13;
is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.&#13;
&#13;
     14.    Amendment and Termination of the Plan.&#13;
            ------------------------------------- &#13;
&#13;
            (a)  Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend,&#13;
                 -------------------------&#13;
alter, suspend or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment, alteration, suspension&#13;
or discontinuation shall be made which would impair the rights of any Optionee&#13;

other applicable law or regulation), the Company shall obtain stockholder&#13;

                 ----------------------------------&#13;

             ----------------------------------                             &#13;
pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the&#13;
issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all&#13;
relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of&#13;
1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated&#13;
thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may&#13;

regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's&#13;
counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder,&#13;
shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or&#13;
sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been&#13;
obtained.&#13;
&#13;
     17.     Agreements. Options and Stock Purchase Rights shall be evidenced by&#13;

          -----------------                                                &#13;

upon exercise of an option, have been owned by the Optionee for more than six&#13;
(6) months on the date of surrender, AND (ii) have a Fair Market Value on the&#13;

          -----------------------------                                        &#13;

          --------------                                                        &#13;

accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Option Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
     6.   Tax Consequences.  Some of the federal and state tax consequences&#13;
          ----------------                                                 &#13;
relating to this Option, as of the date of this Option, are set forth below.&#13;
THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE&#13;
SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING&#13;
THIS OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.&#13;
&#13;
          Exercising the Option.&#13;
          --------------------- &#13;
&#13;
                Nonstatutory Stock Option. The Optionee may incur regular&#13;
                -------------------------&#13;
federal income tax and state income tax liability upon exercise of a NSO. The&#13;
Optionee will be treated as having received compensation income (taxable at&#13;
ordinary income tax rates) equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value&#13;
of the Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over their aggregate &#13;
&#13;
                                      -3-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
 &#13;
Exercise Price. If the Optionee is an Employee or a former Employee, the Company&#13;
will be required to withhold from his or her compensation or collect from&#13;
Optionee and pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount in cash equal to&#13;
a percentage of this compensation income at the time of exercise, and may refuse&#13;
to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver Shares if such withholding amounts&#13;
are not delivered at the time of exercise.&#13;
&#13;
                Incentive Stock Option.  If this Option qualifies as an ISO, the&#13;
                ----------------------     &#13;
Optionee will have no regular federal income tax or state income tax liability&#13;
upon its exercise, although the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the&#13;
Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over their aggregate Exercise Price&#13;
will be treated as an adjustment to alternative minimum taxable income for&#13;
federal tax purposes and may subject the Optionee to alternative minimum tax in&#13;
the year of exercise.  In the event that the Optionee undergoes a change of&#13;
status from Employee to Consultant, any Incentive Stock Option of the Optionee&#13;
that remains unexercised shall cease to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option and&#13;
will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option on the ninety-&#13;
first (91st) day following such change of status.&#13;
&#13;
          Disposition of Shares.&#13;
          --------------------- &#13;
&#13;
                NSO. If the Optionee holds NSO Shares for at least one year, any&#13;
                ---&#13;
gain realized on disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital&#13;
gain for federal income tax purposes.&#13;
&#13;
                ISO. If the Optionee holds ISO Shares for at least one year&#13;
                ---&#13;
after exercise and two years after the grant date, any gain realized on&#13;
disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain for federal&#13;
income tax purposes. If the Optionee disposes of ISO Shares within one year&#13;
after exercise or two years after the grant date, any gain realized on such&#13;
disposition will be treated as compensation income (taxable at ordinary income&#13;
rates) to the extent of the excess, if any, of the lesser of (A) the difference&#13;
between the Fair Market Value of the Shares acquired on the date of exercise and&#13;
the aggregate Exercise Price, or (B) the difference between the sale price of&#13;
such Shares and the aggregate Exercise Price.&#13;
&#13;
          Notice of Disqualifying Disposition of ISO Shares.  If the Optionee&#13;
          -------------------------------------------------                  &#13;
sells or otherwise disposes of any of the Shares acquired pursuant to an ISO on&#13;
or before the later of (i) two years after the grant date, or (ii) one year&#13;
after the exercise date, the Optionee shall immediately notify the Company in&#13;
writing of such disposition.  The Optionee agrees that he or she may be subject&#13;
to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation income recognized&#13;
from such early disposition of ISO Shares by payment in cash or out of the&#13;
current earnings paid to the Optionee.&#13;
&#13;
     7.   Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  The Plan is incorporated herein by&#13;

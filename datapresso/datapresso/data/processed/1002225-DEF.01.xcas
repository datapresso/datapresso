Board Meetings and Committees&#13;
&#13;
         The  Board  of  Directors  held  a  total  of six  meetings  (including&#13;
regularly  scheduled  and special  meetings)  during  fiscal 1997.  No incumbent&#13;
director during the last fiscal year,  while a member of the Board of Directors,&#13;
attended  fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of&#13;
the  Board of  Directors  and (ii) the  total  number  of  meetings  held by all&#13;
committees on which such director served.&#13;
&#13;
     The Board of Directors of the Company has two standing committees: an Audit&#13;
Committee and a Compensation  Committee. It does not have a nominating committee&#13;
or a committee performing the functions of a nominating committee.&#13;
&#13;
         The Audit Committee,  which currently  consists of, Messrs.  Zuendt and&#13;
Van Auken,  is  responsible  for (i)  recommending  engagement  of the Company's&#13;
independent  auditors,  (ii) approving the services  performed by such auditors,&#13;
(iii) consulting with such auditors and reviewing with them the results of their&#13;
examination, (iv) reviewing and approving any material accounting policy changes&#13;
affecting the Company's  operating results,  (v) reviewing the Company's control&#13;
procedures  and  personnel,  and (vi)  reviewing  and  evaluating  the Company's&#13;
accounting principles and its system of internal accounting controls.  The Audit&#13;
Committee held one meeting during fiscal 1997.&#13;
&#13;
         The  Compensation  Committee,   which  currently  consists  of  Messrs.&#13;
Robinson  and  Zweben,  is  responsible  for (i)  reviewing  and  approving  the&#13;
compensation and benefits for the Company's  officers and other employees,  (ii)&#13;
administering  the Company's  stock  purchase and stock option plans,  and (iii)&#13;
making  recommendations  to the Board of Directors  regarding such matters.  The&#13;
Compensation Committee held one meeting during fiscal 1997.&#13;
&#13;
Compensation of Directors&#13;
&#13;
         Directors  who are  employees of the Company do not receive  additional&#13;
compensation   for  their  services  as  directors  of  the  Company.   However,&#13;
nonemployee members of the Board of Directors receive an annual cash retainer of&#13;
$5,000 and $1,250 for  attendance  at each  meeting of the Board of Directors or&#13;
any committee thereof.&#13;
&#13;
         In addition,  nonemployee  directors  participate in the Company's 1995&#13;
Director  Option Plan (the "Director  Plan").  The Director Plan was approved by&#13;
the Board in October 1995 and was ratified by  stockholders in November 1995, at&#13;
which time a total of 75,000  shares of Common Stock were  reserved for issuance&#13;
thereunder.  As of March 26, 1998, there were 48,000 options  outstanding  under&#13;
the  Director  Plan.  The  Director  Plan  became  effective  on the date of the&#13;
Company's  initial  public  offering  on November  15,  1995,  and is  currently&#13;
administered  by  the  Board  of  Directors.   Under  the  Director  Plan,  each&#13;
nonemployee director is automatically granted a non-qualified option to purchase&#13;
10,000  shares on the date upon which such person first  becomes a director (the&#13;
"Initial  Option") with an exercise  price equal to the fair market value of the&#13;
Company's  Common Stock as of the date of grant.  Thereafter,  each  nonemployee&#13;
director is  automatically  granted an option to purchase 2,000 shares of Common&#13;
Stock on  December  1 of each  year,  except in the year the  Director  Plan was&#13;
adopted ("Subsequent  Option"),  provided he or she has served as a director for&#13;
at least six months as of such date.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         Options granted under the Director Plan have a term of ten years unless&#13;
terminated  sooner upon  termination of the  optionee's  status as a director or&#13;
otherwise  pursuant to the Director Plan.  Such options are  transferable by the&#13;
optionee only in certain  limited  circumstances  and each option is exercisable&#13;
during  the  lifetime  of the  director  only by such  director  or a  permitted&#13;
transferee.  Initial  Options  granted under the Director Plan vest as to 20% of&#13;
the  shares  on the  first  anniversary  date of grant  and as to the  remaining&#13;
shares, ratably each month over the ensuing four years. Subsequent Options begin&#13;
to vest on the fourth  anniversary  of the date of grant and vest  ratably  each&#13;
month over the next 12 month  period.  The  Director  Plan is  designed  to work&#13;
automatically, without administration;  however, to the extent administration is&#13;
necessary,  the Director  Plan has been  structured  so that options  granted to&#13;
nonemployee  directors who administer the Company's other employee benefit plans&#13;
shall qualify as  transactions  exempt from Section 16(b) of the  Securities and&#13;
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Exchange  Act"),  pursuant to Rule 16b-3&#13;
promulgated thereunder.&#13;
&#13;
Required Vote&#13;
&#13;
         The five nominees  receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of&#13;
the shares  present or  represented  and  entitled to be voted for them shall be&#13;
elected  as  directors,  whether  or not such  affirmative  votes  constitute  a&#13;
majority of the shares voted.  Votes  withheld from any director are counted for&#13;
purposes of determining  the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction&#13;
of business, but they have no legal effect under Delaware law.&#13;
&#13;
         MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE NOMINEES LISTED ABOVE.&#13;

&#13;
                     APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S&#13;
                                 1992 STOCK PLAN&#13;
&#13;
General&#13;
&#13;
         The 1992 Stock Plan as amended (the  "Option  Plan") was adopted by the&#13;
Board of Directors and approved by the  stockholders in August 1992. In February&#13;
1998,  the Board of  Directors  approved  an  amendment  to the  Option  Plan to&#13;
increase the number of shares reserved for issuance  thereunder by an additional&#13;
500,000  shares for a  cumulative  aggregate of  2,288,000  shares  reserved for&#13;
issuance thereunder.  The Option Plan provides for the grant to employees of the&#13;
Company of  incentive  stock  options  within the  meaning of Section 422 of the&#13;
Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code"),  for the  grant of&#13;
nonstatutory   stock  options  and  stock  purchase   rights  to  employees  and&#13;
consultants of the Company.  The Option Plan may be administered by the Board or&#13;
a  committee   approved  by  the  Board.  As  of  March  26,  1998,  there  were&#13;
approximately  100,000  shares of Common Stock  available for issuance under the&#13;
Option Plan.&#13;
&#13;
Proposal&#13;
&#13;
         At the Annual Meeting the  stockholders  are being requested to approve&#13;
the amendment  approved by the Board of Directors in February 1998 to the Option&#13;
Plan to  increase  the number of shares  reserved  for  issuance  thereunder  by&#13;
500,000  shares for a  cumulative  aggregate of  2,788,000  shares  reserved for&#13;
issuance thereunder,  of which options to purchase  appromixately 600,000 shares&#13;
would be available  for future  grants under the Option Plan.  The  amendment to&#13;
increase  the number of shares  reserved  under the Option  Plan is  proposed in&#13;
order to give the Board of Directors greater  flexibility to grant stock options&#13;
and stock  purchase  rights.  The Company  believes that granting  stock options&#13;
motivates  high  levels  of  performance  and  provides  an  effective  means of&#13;
recognizing  employee  contributions to the success of the Company.  The Company&#13;
believes that this policy is of great value in recruiting  and retaining  highly&#13;
qualified  technical  and other key personnel who are in great demand as well as&#13;
rewarding and incenting current employees.  The Board of Directors believes that&#13;
the ability to grant options and stock purchase  rights will be important to the&#13;
future success of the Company by allowing it to accomplish these objectives.&#13;

&#13;
Summary of the Option Plan&#13;
&#13;
         Certain features of the Option Plan are outlined below.&#13;
&#13;
         Administration.  The Option Plan may be  administered by the Board or a&#13;
committee of the Board (the "Administrator"),  which committee is required to be&#13;
constituted  to comply with Section  16(b) of the  Exchange  Act and  applicable&#13;
laws.  Subject to the other provisions of the Option Plan, the Administrator has&#13;
the power to  determine  the terms of any  options  and  stock  purchase  rights&#13;
granted,  including  the  exercise  price,  the number of shares  subject to the&#13;
option or stock purchase right and the exercisability  thereof.  The Option Plan&#13;
is  currently  administered  by  the  Compensation  Committee  of the  Board  of&#13;
Directors.&#13;
&#13;
         Eligibility  and  Terms of  Options.  The  Option  Plan  provides  that&#13;
nonstatutory  stock  options and stock  purchase  rights may be granted  only to&#13;
employees  and  consultants.  Incentive  stock  options  may be granted  only to&#13;
employees.  An  optionee  who has been  granted an option  may,  if he or she is&#13;
otherwise eligible, be granted additional options or stock purchase rights. With&#13;
respect to any  optionee who owns stock  possessing  more than 10% of the voting&#13;
power of all classes of stock of the Company (a "10% Stockholder"), the exercise&#13;
price of any incentive stock option granted must equal at least 110% of the fair&#13;
market  value on the grant  date and the  maximum  term of the  option  must not&#13;
exceed five years.  The term of all other  options under the Option Plan may not&#13;
exceed ten years.  The  Administrator  selects the optionees and  determines the&#13;
number of shares to be subject to each  option.  In making  such  determination,&#13;
there is taken into account the duties and  responsibilities  of the employee or&#13;
consultant,  the value of his or her services,  his or her present and potential&#13;
contribution to the success of the Company,  the anticipated  number of years of&#13;
future service and other relevant factors.&#13;
&#13;
         Terms and  Conditions of Options.  Each option granted under the Option&#13;
Plan is evidenced by a written stock option  agreement  between the optionee and&#13;
the Company and is subject to the following terms and conditions:&#13;
&#13;
                  (a) Exercise Price. The Administrator  determines the exercise&#13;
         price of options  to  purchase  shares of Common  Stock at the time the&#13;
         options are granted.  However, the exercise price of an incentive stock&#13;
         option must not be less than 100% (110% if issued to a 10% Stockholder)&#13;
         of the fair market  value of the Common Stock on the date the option is&#13;
         granted.  For so long as the  Company's  Common  Stock is traded on the&#13;
         Nasdaq  National  Market,  the fair  market  value of a share of Common&#13;
         Stock  shall be the  closing  sale price for such stock (or the closing&#13;
         bid if no sales were reported) as quoted on the Nasdaq  National Market&#13;
         on the date the option is granted.&#13;
&#13;
                  (b) Exercise of the Option.  Each stock option  agreement will&#13;
         specify  the term of the  option  and the date  when the  option  is to&#13;
         become  exercisable.  The terms of such vesting are  determined  by the&#13;
         Administrator.  Options  granted  under the Option Plan have a ten-year&#13;
         term and to date generally become exercisable over five years at a rate&#13;
         of  one-fifth  of the shares  subject to the  options at the end of one&#13;
         year from the date of grant and 1/60th each month thereafter. An option&#13;
         is  exercised  by giving  written  notice of exercise  to the  Company,&#13;
         specifying  the number of full shares of Common  Stock to be  purchased&#13;
         and by tendering full payment of the purchase price to the Company.&#13;
&#13;
                  (c) Form of  Consideration.  The  consideration to be paid for&#13;
         the shares of Common Stock  issued upon  exercise of an option shall be&#13;
         determined  by  the  Administrator  and  is set  forth  in  the  option&#13;
         agreement. Such form of consideration may vary for each option, and may&#13;
         consist entirely of cash,  check,  promissory note, other shares of the&#13;
         Company's  Common  Stock  meeting  certain  criteria,  any  combination&#13;
         thereof,  or any other legally permissible form of consideration as may&#13;
         be provided in the Option Plan or the option agreement.&#13;
&#13;
                  (d)  Termination  of  Employment.  In the event an  optionee's&#13;
         continuous  status as an  employee  or  consultant  terminates  for any&#13;
         reason  (other  than  upon the  optionee's  death or  disability),  the&#13;
         optionee may exercise his or her option to the extent that the optionee&#13;
         was entitled to exercise it at the date of such  termination,  but only&#13;
         within  such period of time set forth in the option  agreement  (not to&#13;
         exceed three months in the case of an incentive  stock option) from the&#13;
         date of such  termination (and in no event later &#13;
&#13;
                                      -5-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          than the  expiration  of the term of such  option  as set forth in the&#13;
          option  agreement).  If no period of time is  specified  in the option&#13;
          agreement,  the  optionee  may  exercise  his or her  option for three&#13;
          months  following  the date of such  termination,  subject to the same&#13;
          limitations set forth above.  Options granted under the Option Plan to&#13;
          date have generally provided that optionees may exercise their options&#13;
          within ninety days from the date of termination  of employment  (other&#13;
          than for death or disability).&#13;
&#13;
                  (e) Disability.  In the event an optionee's  continuous status&#13;
         as an employee or  consultant  terminates  as a result of permanent and&#13;
         total  disability  (as defined in Section  22(e)(3)  of the Code),  the&#13;
         optionee may exercise his or her option to the extent that the optionee&#13;
         was  entitled to exercise  it at the date of such  termination,  within&#13;
         twelve months from the date of such  termination (but in no event later&#13;
         than the  expiration  of the term of such  option  as set  forth in the&#13;
         option agreement).&#13;
&#13;
                  (f) Death. In the event of an optionee's death, the optionee's&#13;
         estate or a person who  acquired  the right to  exercise  the  deceased&#13;
         optionee's  option by bequest or inheritance may exercise the option to&#13;
         the extent that the optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of&#13;
         death,  within  twelve  months  following  the date of death (but in no&#13;
         event later than the expiration of the term of such option as set forth&#13;
         in the option agreement).&#13;
&#13;
                  (g) Termination of Options.  Excluding incentive stock options&#13;
         issued to 10%  Stockholders,  options  granted  under the  Option  Plan&#13;
         expire on the date set forth in the option agreement (not to exceed ten&#13;
         years from the date of grant).  Incentive  stock options granted to 10%&#13;
         Stockholders  expire five years from the date of grant (or such shorter&#13;
         period set forth in the option  agreement).  No option may be exercised&#13;
         by any person after the expiration of its term.&#13;
&#13;
                  (h)    Nontransferability    of   Options.    An   option   is&#13;
         nontransferable  by the  optionee,  other  than by will or the  laws of&#13;
         descent and  distribution,  and is  exercisable  during the  optionee's&#13;
         lifetime only by the optionee.  In the event of the  optionee's  death,&#13;
         options may be exercised by a person who acquires the right to exercise&#13;
         the option by bequest or inheritance.&#13;
&#13;
                  (i) Value  Limitation.  If the aggregate  fair market value of&#13;
         all shares of Common Stock  subject to an  optionee's  incentive  stock&#13;
         option  which are  exercisable  for the first time during any  calendar&#13;
         year  exceeds  $100,000,   the  excess  options  shall  be  treated  as&#13;
         nonstatutory options.&#13;
&#13;
                  (j) Other  Provisions.  The stock option agreement may contain&#13;
         such other terms,  provisions and conditions not inconsistent  with the&#13;
         Option Plan as may be determined by the Administrator.&#13;
&#13;
         Terms And  Conditions Of Stock  Purchase  Rights.  Each stock  purchase&#13;
right  granted under the Option Plan shall be evidenced by a written offer which&#13;
sets  forth  the  terms,  conditions  and  restrictions  related  to the  offer,&#13;
including the number of shares  subject to the offer,  the price per share,  and&#13;
the time in which the offeree must accept the offer (which may not exceed ninety&#13;
days from the date the  Administrator  granted the stock  purchase  right).  The&#13;
offer must be accepted by  executing  a purchase  agreement  with such terms and&#13;
conditions as determined by the Administrator. The stock purchased pursuant to a&#13;
stock  purchase  right  shall be  subject to a  repurchase  option  (unless  the&#13;
Administrator  determines  otherwise)  upon any  termination of the  purchaser's&#13;
employment  with the  Company  (including  termination  as a result  of death or&#13;
disability).  Pursuant to such repurchase  option,  the Company shall be able to&#13;
repurchase any shares of stock as to which the repurchase  option has not lapsed&#13;
at the price per share originally paid by the purchaser. The Administrator shall&#13;
determine the rate at which the repurchase  option lapses.  A purchaser of stock&#13;
pursuant to a stock purchase right shall have the rights  equivalent to those of&#13;
a stockholder.&#13;
         &#13;
     Adjustment Upon Changes In Capitalization;  Corporate Transactions.  In the&#13;
event of changes in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of any&#13;
stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, mergers,  recapitalizations&#13;
or  other  change  in the  capital  structure  of the  Company,  an  appropriate&#13;
adjustment shall be made by the  Administrator in the following:  (i) the number&#13;
of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option Plan,  (ii) the number and class&#13;
of shares of stock  subject to any option or stock  purchase  right  outstanding&#13;
under the Option  Plan,  (iii) and the  exercise  price of any such  outstanding&#13;
option or stock purchase right.  The  &#13;
&#13;
                                      -6-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
determination of the  Administrator as to which  adjustments shall be made shall&#13;
be  conclusive.  In the event of a proposed  dissolution  or  liquidation of the&#13;
Company,  all  outstanding  options  will  terminate  immediately  prior  to the&#13;
consummation  of such  proposed  action.  The  Board  of  Directors  in its sole&#13;
discretion  may in such  circumstances  declare that any  outstanding  option or&#13;
stock  purchase  right  shall  terminate  as of a date  fixed  by the  Board  of&#13;
Directors  and give each  optionee  the right to  exercise  his or her option or&#13;
stock  purchase  right,  including  as to shares  for which the  option or stock&#13;
purchase right would not otherwise be exercisable.&#13;
&#13;
         Merger or Asset Sale.  In the event of a merger of the Company  with or&#13;
into another corporation,  or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the&#13;
Company,  each outstanding  option or stock purchase right will be assumed or an&#13;
equivalent option or right substituted by the successor  corporation or a parent&#13;
or  subsidiary  of the  successor  corporation.  In the event that the successor&#13;
corporation  refuses to assume or  substitute  for the option or stock  purchase&#13;
right,  the  optionee  shall  have the  right to  exercise  the  option or stock&#13;
purchase right as to all of the optioned stock,  including shares as to which it&#13;
would not otherwise be  exercisable,  for a period of not more than fifteen days&#13;
after the Administrator grants the optionee notice of such right.&#13;
&#13;
         Amendment and Termination of the Option Plan. The Board may at any time&#13;
amend,  alter,  suspend or terminate  the Option Plan.  The Company shall obtain&#13;
stockholder approval of any amendment to the Option Plan in such a manner and to&#13;
such a degree as is necessary  and desirable to comply with Rule 16b-3 under the&#13;
Exchange  Act or  Section  422 of the  Code  (or  any  other  applicable  law or&#13;
regulation,  including the  requirements of any exchange or quotation  system on&#13;
which the Common Stock is traded).  Any amendment or  termination  of the Option&#13;
Plan shall not affect options  already  granted and such options shall remain in&#13;
full force and effect as if the Option Plan had not been amended or  terminated,&#13;
unless mutually  agreed  otherwise  between the optionee and the Company,  which&#13;
agreement must be in writing and signed by the optionee and the Company.  In any&#13;
event,  the Option Plan shall terminate in August 2002. Any options  outstanding&#13;
under the Option Plan at the time of its  termination  shall remain  outstanding&#13;
until they expire by their terms.&#13;
&#13;
Federal Tax Information&#13;
&#13;
         Options  granted under the Option Plan may be either  "incentive  stock&#13;
options," as defined in Section 422 of the Code, or nonstatutory options.&#13;
&#13;
         An optionee who is granted an incentive stock option will not recognize&#13;
taxable  income  either at the time the option is granted or upon its  exercise,&#13;
although the exercise may subject the optionee to the  alternative  minimum tax.&#13;
Upon sale or  exchange  of the  shares  more than two years  after  grant of the&#13;
option and one year after exercise of the option, any gain or loss is treated as&#13;
long-term  capital gain or loss. Net capital gains on shares held between 12 and&#13;
18 months are  currently  taxed at a maximum  federal  rate of 28%.  Net capital&#13;
gains on shares held for more than 18 months are capped at 20%.  Capital  losses&#13;
are allowed in full against capital gains and up to $3,000 against other income.&#13;
If these holding  periods are not satisfied,  the optionee  recognizes  ordinary&#13;
income at the time of disposition  equal to the difference  between the exercise&#13;
price and the lower of (i) the fair  market  value of the  shares at the date of&#13;
the  option  exercise  or (ii) the sale  price of the  shares.  Any gain or loss&#13;
recognized on such a premature disposition of the shares in excess of the amount&#13;
treated as ordinary income is treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or&#13;
loss,  depending on the holding period. A different rule for measuring  ordinary&#13;
income upon such a premature  disposition  may apply if the  optionee is also an&#13;
officer, director, or 10% stockholder of the Company. The Company is entitled to&#13;
a  deduction  in the  same  amount  as the  ordinary  income  recognized  by the&#13;
optionee.&#13;
&#13;
         All of the options which do not qualify as incentive  stock options are&#13;
referred to as nonstatutory  options. An optionee does not recognize any taxable&#13;
income  at the time he or she is  granted  a  nonstatutory  stock  option.  Upon&#13;
exercise,  the optionee  recognizes  taxable  income  generally  measured by the&#13;
excess of the then fair market value of the shares over the exercise price.  Any&#13;
taxable income  recognized in connection  with an option exercise by an employee&#13;
of the  Company is subject to tax  withholding  by the  Company.  The Company is&#13;
entitled to a deduction in the same amount as the ordinary income  recognized by&#13;
the optionee.  Upon a disposition of such &#13;
&#13;
                                      -7-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
shares by the optionee, any difference between the sale price and the optionee's&#13;
exercise  price,  to the extent not  recognized  as taxable  income as  provided&#13;
above, is treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss,  depending on&#13;
the holding  period.  Net capital  gains on shares held between 12 and 18 months&#13;
are  currently  taxed at a maximum  federal  rate of 28%.  Net capital  gains on&#13;
shares  held for more  than 18 months  are  capped at 20%.  Capital  losses  are&#13;
allowed in full against capital gains and up to $3,000 against other income.&#13;
&#13;
         The granting of a stock purchase right is not a taxable event. However,&#13;
at the time the right is exercised,  the  purchaser of the resulting  restricted&#13;
stock recognizes  ordinary income as the repurchase option of the Company lapses&#13;
equal to the difference  between the fair market value of the shares of the time&#13;
of such lapse and the price paid for such shares,  if any (the "Spread").  Under&#13;
current  federal  tax law,  the  purchaser  may elect to  include  the Spread as&#13;
ordinary  income  for the  year of the  award.  If the  election  is  made,  the&#13;
purchaser will not incur  additional tax liability until the sale or disposition&#13;
of the shares.  If the shares are  forfeited  following  such an  election,  the&#13;
purchaser's basis in such forfeited shares is the price paid for the shares. The&#13;
Company is entitled to federal tax  deduction in the same amount and at the same&#13;
time as the employee realizes ordinary income.&#13;
&#13;
         The Company  will be entitled to a tax  deduction in the same amount as&#13;
the ordinary  income  recognized by the optionee with respect to shares acquired&#13;
upon exercise of a nonstatutory option.&#13;
&#13;
         The  foregoing  is only a  summary  of the  effect  of  federal  income&#13;
taxation  upon the  optionee  and the  Company  with  respect  to the  grant and&#13;
exercise of options  under the Option Plan;  it does not purport to be complete,&#13;
and it does not  discuss the tax  consequences  of the  optionee's  death or the&#13;
income  tax laws of any  municipality,  state  or  foreign  country  in which an&#13;
optionee may reside.&#13;

         The  following  table sets forth  information  with  respect to options&#13;

                     APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S&#13;
                        1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN&#13;
&#13;
General&#13;
&#13;
         The Company's 1995 Employee  Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase  Plan")&#13;
was adopted by the Board of Directors in October 1995, and subsequently ratified&#13;
by the stockholders as of the effective date of the public  offering.  Under the&#13;
Purchase Plan, the Company  maintains  offering periods of a six-month  duration&#13;
commencing on the first trading day following  termination of the prior offering&#13;
period.  The Purchase Plan is  administered by the Company's Board of Directors,&#13;
and is open to all  individuals  employed by the Company or its  subsidiaries on&#13;
the  commencement  day of an offering if such  individuals  are  employed by the&#13;
Company  for at least 20 hours  per week  and at least  five  months  per  year.&#13;
Individuals who hold 5% or more of the Company's  Common Stock (directly or upon&#13;
exercise of  option(s))  are not  eligible to  participate.  The  Purchase  Plan&#13;
permits eligible employees to purchase Common Stock through payroll  deductions,&#13;
which may not exceed 10% of an employee's  compensation,  excluding  bonuses (or&#13;
$25,000  in any  calendar  year),  at a price  equal to 85% of the  lower of the&#13;
closing sale price to the Common Stock reported on the NASDAQ national market at&#13;
the beginning and the end of each six month operating  period,  except that with&#13;
respect  to the first  offering  period,  the  beginning  price was equal to the&#13;
initial public offering and price set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus.&#13;
&#13;
Proposal&#13;
&#13;
         At the Annual Meeting the  stockholders  are being requested to approve&#13;
an amendment to the Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares  reserved for&#13;
issuance thereunder by 200,000 shares, for an aggregate of 300,000 shares having&#13;
been reserved for issuance thereunder.  As of December 31, 1997, an aggregate of&#13;
9,000 shares were available for issuance under the Purchase Plan (without giving&#13;
effect to the  proposed  amendment).  The  amendment  to increase  the number of&#13;
shares  reserved  under  the  Purchase  Plan  is  proposed  in  order  to  allow&#13;
individuals  employed by the  Company to  continue to purchase  shares of Common&#13;
Stock of the Company  through  payroll  deductions  at a 15%  discount to market&#13;
price.  The Company  believes  that  allowing  employees to continue to purchase&#13;
shares of the  Company's  Common  Stock  through  the  Purchase  Plan  motivates&#13;
high-levels  of  performance  and  provides an  effective  means of  encouraging&#13;
employee  commitment  to the success of the Company.  The Company  believes that&#13;
this policy is of great value in  recruiting  and  retaining  new  employees and&#13;
allowing  existing  employees to participate in the success of the Company.  The&#13;
Board of  Directors  believes  that the  ability to grant  participation  in the&#13;
Purchase Plan will be important to the future success of the Company by allowing&#13;
it to accomplish these objectives.&#13;
&#13;
Summary of the Purchase Plan&#13;
&#13;
     General.  The Purchase Plan is intended to qualify  under  Sections 421 and&#13;
423 of the Code as an "Employee Stock Purchase Plan."&#13;
&#13;
     Administration. The Purchase Plan is administered by the Board of Directors&#13;
or a Committee of the Board.&#13;
&#13;
         Eligibility. Only employees employed by the Company or its subsidiaries&#13;
on the first day of an offering period may participate in the Purchase Plan. For&#13;
this purpose,  an "employee" is any person who is regularly employed at least 20&#13;
hours per week and at least five months per calendar  year by the Company or any&#13;
of its  subsidiaries.  No employee shall be granted an option under the Purchase&#13;
Plan if (i)  immediately  after the grant of the option,  the  employee  (or any&#13;
person  whose  stock would be  attributed  to the  employee  pursuant to Section&#13;
424(d) of the Code),  would own 5% or more of the total combined voting power or&#13;
value of the  stock of the  Company  or any of its  subsidiaries  or (ii)  which&#13;
permits such  participant's  right to purchase  stock under all  Employee  Stock&#13;
Purchase  Plans of the  Company and its  subsidiaries  to accrue at a rate which&#13;
exceeds  $25,000 worth of stock  (determined  with  reference to the fair market&#13;
value of the Common Stock on the first day&#13;
&#13;
                                      -9-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
of the  offering  period)  in a  calendar  year.  Subject  to these  eligibility&#13;
criteria,  the Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase Common Stock&#13;
through payroll deductions subject to certain limitations described below.&#13;
&#13;
         Offering.  The Purchase Plan has consecutive  and overlapping  24-month&#13;
offering  periods that begin every six months,  commencing  on the first Trading&#13;
Day (as defined in the  Purchase  Plan) on or after  March 1 and  September 1 of&#13;
each year.  Each  24-month  offering  period  includes four  six-month  purchase&#13;
periods  during which  payroll  deductions  are  accumulated  and, at the end of&#13;
which,  shares of Common Stock are purchased  with a  participant's  accumulated&#13;
payroll  deductions.  The Board has the power to change the  duration  of future&#13;
offering  periods,  if such  change  is made at  least  five  days  prior to the&#13;
scheduled  beginning of the first offering period to be affected.  The first day&#13;
of an offering period is referred to as the "Enrollment  Date," and the last day&#13;
of the purchase period is referred to as the "Exercise Date."&#13;
&#13;
         Purchase Price.  The purchase price per share which shares will be sold&#13;
in an  offering  under  the  Purchase  Plan is the  lower of (i) 85% of the fair&#13;
market value of a share of Common Stock on the  Enrollment  Date, or (ii) 85% of&#13;
the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the relevant  Exercise Date.&#13;
The  fair  market  value  of the  Common  Stock  on a given  date  is  generally&#13;
determined with reference to the closing sale price of the Common Stock for such&#13;
date.&#13;
&#13;
         Payment of Purchase Price;  Payroll  Deductions.  The purchase price of&#13;
the shares is accumulated by payroll  deductions over the offering  period.  The&#13;
Purchase Plan provides that the aggregate of such payroll  deductions during the&#13;
offering  period shall not exceed 10% of the  participant's  total  compensation&#13;
during said offering period,  nor $21,250 in any given calendar year. During the&#13;
offering period,  a participant may discontinue his or her  participation in the&#13;
Purchase Plan, and may decrease or increase the rate of payroll deductions in an&#13;
offering period within limits set by the Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
         Withdrawal. A participant may terminate his or her participation in the&#13;
Purchase Plan at any time by giving the Company a written  notice of withdrawal.&#13;
In such event the payroll deductions  credited to participant's  account will be&#13;
returned,  without interest,  to such participant.  Payroll  deductions will not&#13;
resume unless a new  Subscription  Agreement is delivered in  connection  with a&#13;
subsequent offering period.&#13;
&#13;
         Termination of Employment.  Termination of a  participant's  employment&#13;
for  any  reason,  including  death,  cancels  his or her  participation  in the&#13;
Purchase Plan immediately. In such event, the payroll deductions credited to the&#13;
participant's account will be returned without interest to such participant, his&#13;
or her designated beneficiaries or the executors or administrators of his or her&#13;
estate.&#13;
&#13;
         Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization. In the event of any changes&#13;
in the  capitalization of the Company effective without receipt of consideration&#13;
by  the  Company,  such  as  a  stock  split,  stock  dividend,  combination  or&#13;
reclassification of the Common Stock resulting in an increase or decrease in the&#13;
number of shares of Common Stock,  proportionate adjustments will be made by the&#13;
Board and the shares  subject to  purchase  and in the price per share under the&#13;
Purchase Plan. In the event of  liquidation  or dissolution of the Company,  the&#13;
offering  periods  then in  progress  will  terminate  immediately  prior to the&#13;
consummation of such event unless otherwise  provided by the Board. In the event&#13;
of a sale of all or  substantially  all of the  assets  of the  Company,  or the&#13;
merger of the Company  with or into another  corporation,  each option under the&#13;
Purchase Plan shall be assumed or an equivalent  option shall be  substituted by&#13;
each  successor  corporation  or  a  parent  or  subsidiary  of  such  successor&#13;
corporation,  unless the Board determines to shorten the offering period then in&#13;
progress by setting a new  Exercise  Date.  If the Board  shortens  the offering&#13;
period in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of&#13;
assets,  the Board  shall  provide  notice to each  participant  of at least ten&#13;
business  days prior to the new Exercise  Date that the  Exercise  Date has been&#13;
changed  to  the  new  Exercise  Date  and  that  his  or  her  option  will  be&#13;
automatically  exercised on the new Exercise  Date unless prior to such date the&#13;
participant has withdrawn from the offering period.&#13;
&#13;
         Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time and for any reason&#13;
amend or terminate  the Purchase  Plan,  except that no such  termination  shall&#13;
affect options  previously  granted and no amendment shall make any change in an&#13;
option grant prior thereto that adversely  affects the right of any participant.&#13;

&#13;
approval for  amendments to the Purchase Plan shall be obtained in such a manner&#13;
and to such a degree as required to comply with Section 16(b)(3) of the Exchange&#13;
Act or with Section 423 of the Code (or any  successor  rule or provision or any&#13;
other applicable law or regulation).&#13;
&#13;
Federal Tax Information&#13;
&#13;
         No income will be taxable to a participant  until the shares  purchased&#13;
under the Purchase  Plan are sold or  otherwise  disposed of. Upon sale or other&#13;
disposition of the shares,  the participant  will generally be subject to tax in&#13;
an amount  that  depends  upon the  holding  period.  If the  shares are sold or&#13;
otherwise  disposed of more than two years from the Enrollment Date and one year&#13;
from the  applicable  Exercise  Date, the  participant  will recognize  ordinary&#13;
income  measured as the lesser of (a) the excess of the fair market value of the&#13;
shares at the time of such sale or disposition over the purchase price or (b) an&#13;
amount equal to 15% of the fair market value of the shares as of the  Enrollment&#13;
Date.  Any  additional  gain will be treated as long-term  capital  gain. If the&#13;
shares are sold or otherwise  disposed of before the expiration of these holding&#13;
periods,  the participant will recognize  ordinary income generally  measured as&#13;
the  excess of the fair  market  value of the  shares on the date the shares are&#13;
purchased over the purchase  price.  Any additional gain or loss on such sale or&#13;
disposition will be long-term or short-term  capital gain or loss,  depending on&#13;
the holding  period.  The Company  generally is not entitled to a deduction  for&#13;
amounts taxed as ordinary income or capital gain to a participant  except to the&#13;
extent of ordinary income  recognized by participants upon a sale or disposition&#13;
of shares prior to the expiration of the holding periods described above.&#13;

             RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS&#13;
&#13;
         The  Board  of  Directors  has  selected   Coopers  &amp;  Lybrand  L.L.P.,&#13;
independent  accountants,  to audit the financial  statements of the Company for&#13;
the fiscal year ending December 31, 1998.  Coopers &amp; Lybrand L.L.P.  has audited&#13;
the Company's  financial  statements since 1989. A  representative  of Coopers &amp;&#13;
Lybrand  L.L.P.  is  expected  to be  present  at the  meeting,  will  have  the&#13;
opportunity  to make a statement,  and is expected to be available to respond to&#13;
appropriate questions.&#13;
&#13;
Required Vote&#13;
&#13;
         The Board of Directors has conditioned its appointment of the Company's&#13;
independent  accountants  upon the receipt of the affirmative vote of a majority&#13;
of the  shares  represented,  in person or by proxy,  and  voting at the  Annual&#13;
Meeting,  which shares voting  affirmatively also constitute at least a majority&#13;
of the required  quorum.  In the event that the  stockholders do not approve the&#13;
selection  of  Coopers &amp; Lybrand  L.L.P.,  the  appointment  of the  independent&#13;
accountants will be reconsidered by the Board of Directors.&#13;
&#13;
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT&#13;
OF COOPERS &amp; LYBRAND, L.L.P., AS INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDING&#13;

(1)  The number and percentage of shares  beneficially owned is determined under&#13;
     rules  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission   ("SEC"),   and  the&#13;
     information is not necessarily  indicative of beneficial  ownership for any&#13;
     other purpose.  Under such rules,  beneficial ownership includes any shares&#13;
     as to which the  individual  has sole or shared  voting power or investment&#13;
     power and also any  shares  which the  individual  has the right to acquire&#13;
     within  sixty days of March 26,  1998  through  the  exercise  of any stock&#13;
     option or other right.  Unless otherwise  indicated in the footnotes,  each&#13;

&#13;
(1)  All options in this table are  incentive  stock  options  and were  granted&#13;
     under the 1992 Stock Option Plan and have exercise prices equal to the fair&#13;
     market value on the date of grant. All such options have ten-year terms and&#13;
     vest over a  five-year  period at the rate of  one-fifth  at the end of one&#13;
     year from the date of grant and 1/60th each month thereafter.&#13;
&#13;
(2)  The Company granted  options to purchase  836,000 shares of Common Stock to&#13;
     employees in fiscal 1997.&#13;
&#13;
(3)  Options may  terminate  before their  expiration  upon the  termination  of&#13;
     optionee's status as an employee or consultant,  the optionee's death or an&#13;
     acquisition of the Company.&#13;
&#13;
(4)  Potential  realizable value assumes that the stock price increases from the&#13;
     exercise  price from the date of grant until the end of the option term (10&#13;
     years)  at the  annual  rate  specified  (5% and 10%).  Annual  compounding&#13;
     results in total  appreciation of approximately  62.9% (at 5% per year) and&#13;
     159.4% (at 10% per year).  The assumed  annual  rates of  appreciation  are&#13;
     specified  in SEC rules and do not  represent  the  Company's  estimate  or&#13;
     projection of future stock price growth.  The Company does not  necessarily&#13;
     agree that this method can properly determine the value of an option.&#13;

         REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS&#13;
&#13;
         The Compensation  Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee")&#13;
consists of directors Monte F. Zweben and Frank H. Robinson,  neither of whom is&#13;
an employee or officer of the Company. The Committee sets policy and administers&#13;
the Company's cash and equity  incentive  programs for the purpose of attracting&#13;
and retaining highly skilled  executives who will promote the Company's business&#13;
goals and build long-term  stockholder  value. The Committee is also responsible&#13;
for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding all&#13;
forms of compensation to be provided to the executive  officers and directors of&#13;
the Company,  including stock  compensation  and loans,  and all bonus and stock&#13;
compensation to all employees.&#13;
&#13;
         To the extent  appropriate,  the Company  intends to take the necessary&#13;
steps to  conform  its  compensation  practices  to comply  with the $1  million&#13;
compensation  deduction cap under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of&#13;
1986, as amended.&#13;
&#13;
Compensation Philosophy and Policies&#13;
&#13;
         The  policy of the  Committee  is to attract  and retain key  personnel&#13;
through the payment of  competitive  base  salaries and to encourage  and reward&#13;
performance through bonuses and stock ownership.  The Committee's objectives are&#13;
to:&#13;
&#13;
     -    ensure that the executive team has clear goals and accountability with&#13;
          respect to corporate performance;&#13;
&#13;
     -    establish pay  opportunities  that are competitive based on prevailing&#13;
          practices for the industry, the stage of growth, and the labor markets&#13;
          in which the Company operates;&#13;
&#13;
     -    independently  assess operating results on a regular basis in light of&#13;
          expected Company performance; and&#13;
&#13;
     -    align pay  incentives  with the  long-term  interests of the Company's&#13;
          stockholders.&#13;
&#13;
Elements of Compensation&#13;
&#13;
         Compensation  for officers  and key  employees  includes  both cash and&#13;
equity elements.&#13;
&#13;
         Cash compensation  consists of base salary,  which is determined on the&#13;
basis of the level of responsibility,  expertise and experience of the employee,&#13;
and  competitive  conditions  in the industry.  The Committee  believes that the&#13;
salaries of its officers  fall within the software  industry  norm. In addition,&#13;
cash bonuses may be awarded to officers  and other key  employees;  however,  no&#13;
executive officer received a cash bonus in 1997. Compensation of sales personnel&#13;
also includes sales commissions tied to quarterly targets.&#13;
&#13;
         Ownership of the  Company's  Common Stock is a key element of executive&#13;
compensation.  Officers  and other  employees  of the  Company  are  eligible to&#13;
participate  in the 1992 Stock Plan (the  "Option  Plan") and the 1995  Employee&#13;
Stock  Purchase  Plan (the  "Purchase  Plan"),  which were adopted  prior to the&#13;
Company's  initial public offering in November 1995. The Option Plan permits the&#13;
Board of Directors or the  Committee to grant stock options to employees on such&#13;
terms as the Board or the  Committee may  determine.  The Committee has the sole&#13;
authority  to grant stock  options to  executive  officers of the Company and is&#13;
currently administering stock option grants to all employees. In determining the&#13;
size of a stock  option  grant to a new  officer  or  other  key  employee,  the&#13;
Committee takes into account equity participation by comparable employees within&#13;
the Company,  external  competitive  circumstances  and other relevant  factors.&#13;
Additional  options may be granted to current  employees  to reward  exceptional&#13;
performance or to provide additional  unvested equity  incentives.  The Purchase&#13;
Plan permits  employees to acquire Common Stock of the Company  through  payroll&#13;
deductions and promotes broad-based equity participation throughout the Company.&#13;
The  Committee  believes  that  such  stock  plans  align the  interests  of the&#13;
employees with the long-term interests of the stockholders.&#13;
&#13;
                                      -17-&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         The Company also maintains a 401(k) Plan to provide retirement benefits&#13;
through  tax  deferred  salary  deductions  for all its  employees.  The Company&#13;
matches  up to  50%  of an  employee's  contribution,  not to  exceed  $500  per&#13;
employee.&#13;
&#13;
1997 Executive Compensation&#13;
&#13;
         Executive   compensation  for  1997  included  base  salary,  cash  and&#13;
equity-based incentive compensation and, in the case of sales executives,  sales&#13;
commissions.  Cash incentive  compensation is designed to motivate executives to&#13;
attain corporate, business unit and individual goals. The Company's policy is to&#13;
have a significant portion of an executive's total compensation at risk based on&#13;
the Company's  overall  performance.  Since 1996,  the Company has  maintained a&#13;
profit  sharing  plan  for  its  employees,   and  certain  executive   officers&#13;
participated in this program in 1997. Executive officers,  like other employees,&#13;
were eligible for option grants under the Option Plan.&#13;
&#13;
Chief Executive Officer Compensation&#13;
&#13;
         Compensation for the Chief Executive Officer is determined by a process&#13;
similar to that  discussed  above for executive  officers.  The Chief  Executive&#13;
Officer's  target  base pay level has been  analyzed  using data for  comparable&#13;
software  companies.  Ms.  DiMarco  receives no other material  compensation  or&#13;
benefits not provided to all executive officers.&#13;
&#13;
         The Committee has considered the potential  impact of Section 162(m) of&#13;
the  Internal   Revenue  Code  of  1986,  as  amended,   which  limits  the  tax&#13;
deductibility of cash compensation paid to individual  executive  officers to $1&#13;
million per officer. The cash compensation to be paid to the Company's executive&#13;
officers  in fiscal  1996 is not  expected  to exceed the $1  million  limit per&#13;
individual officer.&#13;

sentence, voting rights shall not be considered a benefit of Share ownership.&#13;

          to  Option  or  Stock  Purchase  Right  grants  made to  Employees  or&#13;

&#13;
               (vii)to reduce the exercise price of any Option or Stock Purchase&#13;
          Right to the then  current  Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value&#13;
          of the Common  Stock  covered by such Option or Stock  Purchase  Right&#13;
          shall have declined  since the date the Option or Stock Purchase Right&#13;
          was granted;&#13;

&#13;
          (a)  Nonstatutory  Stock  Options  and Stock  Purchase  Rights  may be&#13;
     granted to  Employees  and  Consultants.  Incentive  Stock  Options  may be&#13;
     granted only to Employees.  An Employee or Consultant  who has been granted&#13;
     an Option or Stock Purchase Right may, if he or she is otherwise  eligible,&#13;
     be granted additional Options or Stock Purchase Rights.&#13;
&#13;
          (b) Each Option shall be designated in the written option agreement as&#13;
     either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory  Stock Option.  However,&#13;
     notwithstanding  such designations,  to the extent that the aggregate Fair&#13;
     Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Options&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       -5-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

     any Optionee  during any  calendar  year (under all plans of the Company or&#13;
     any Parent or Subsidiary)  exceeds  $100,000,  such excess Options shall be&#13;
     treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.&#13;
&#13;
          (c) For purposes of Section  5(b),  Incentive  Stock  Options shall be&#13;
     taken into  account in the order in which they were  granted,  and the Fair&#13;
     Market  Value of the Shares shall be  determined  as of the time the Option&#13;
     with respect to such Shares is granted.&#13;
&#13;
          (d) The Plan shall not confer upon any Optionee any right with respect&#13;
     to continuation of employment or consulting  relationship with the Company,&#13;
     nor shall it  interfere  in any way with his or her right or the  Company's&#13;
     right to terminate his or her employment or consulting  relationship at any&#13;
     time, with or without cause.&#13;
&#13;
          (e) The  following  limitations  shall  apply to grants of Options and&#13;
     Stock Purchase Rights to Employees:&#13;
&#13;
               (i) No  Employee  shall be  granted,  in any  fiscal  year of the&#13;
          Company,  Options  and Stock  Purchase  Rights to  purchase  more than&#13;
          150,000 Shares.&#13;
&#13;
               (ii)  In  connection  with  his or  her  initial  employment,  an&#13;
          Employee may be granted  Options and Stock Purchase Rights to purchase&#13;
          up to an additional  150,000  Shares which shall not count against the&#13;
          limit set forth in subsection (i) above.&#13;
&#13;
               (iii)The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted  proportionately&#13;
          in  connection  with any  change in the  Company's  capitalization  as&#13;
          described in Section 12.&#13;
&#13;
               (iv) If an Option or Stock  Purchase  Right is  cancelled  in the&#13;
          same fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in&#13;
          connection with a transaction  described in Section 12), the cancelled&#13;
          Option or Stock Purchase Right will be counted  against the limits set&#13;
          forth in  subsections  (i) and (ii) above.  For this  purpose,  if the&#13;
          exercise price of an Option or Stock  Purchase  Right is reduced,  the&#13;
          transaction  will be treated as a cancellation  of the Option or Stock&#13;
          Purchase Right and the grant of a new Option or Stock Purchase Right.&#13;
&#13;
     6. Term of Plan. The Plan shall become  effective upon the earlier to occur&#13;
of its adoption by the Board of Directors or its approval by the stockholders of&#13;
the Company as described in Section 18 of the Plan. It shall  continue in effect&#13;
for a term of ten (10) years unless  sooner  terminated  under Section 14 of the&#13;
Plan.&#13;
&#13;
     7. Term of Option.  The term of each Option shall be the term stated in the&#13;
Option  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that the term shall be no more than ten&#13;
(10) years from the date of grant thereof.  However, in the case of an Incentive&#13;
Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns&#13;
stock  representing  more  than ten  percent  (10%) of the  voting  power of all&#13;
classes of stock of the  Company or any Parent or  Subsidiary,  the term of such&#13;
Option shall be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
five (5) years  from the date of grant  thereof or such  shorter  term as may be&#13;
provided in the Option Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
     8. Option Exercise Price and Consideration.&#13;
&#13;
          (a) The per Share exercise price for the Shares to be issued  pursuant&#13;
     to the  exercise of an Option shall be such price as is  determined  by the&#13;
     Administrator, but shall be subject to the following:&#13;
&#13;
               (i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option&#13;
&#13;
                    (A) granted to an Employee  who, at the time of the grant of&#13;
               such Incentive Stock Option,  owns stock  representing  more than&#13;
               ten percent  (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of&#13;
               the Company or any Parent or  Subsidiary,  the per Share exercise&#13;
               price  shall be no less  than 110% of the Fair  Market  Value per&#13;
               Share on the date of grant.&#13;
&#13;
                    (B) granted to any other  Employee,  the per Share  exercise&#13;
               price  shall be no less  than 100% of the Fair  Market  Value per&#13;
               Share on the date of grant.&#13;
&#13;
               (ii) In the case of a  Nonstatutory  Stock Option,  the per Share&#13;
          exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator.&#13;
&#13;
          (b) Form of  Consideration.  The  Administrator  shall  determine  the&#13;
     acceptable form of  consideration  for exercising an Option,  including the&#13;
     method  of  payment.  In  the  case  of  an  Incentive  Stock  Option,  the&#13;
     Administrator  shall determine the acceptable form of  consideration at the&#13;
     time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of:&#13;
&#13;
               (i) cash;&#13;
&#13;
               (ii) check;&#13;
&#13;
               (iii) promissory note;&#13;
&#13;
               (iv) other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares  acquired  upon&#13;
          exercise of an option,  have been owned by the  Optionee for more than&#13;
          six months on the date of surrender,  and (B) have a Fair Market Value&#13;
          on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate  exercise price of the&#13;
          Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised;&#13;
&#13;
               (v) delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with&#13;
          such other  documentation  as the  Administrator  and the  broker,  if&#13;
          applicable,  shall  require  to effect an  exercise  of the Option and&#13;
          delivery to the Company of the sale or loan  proceeds  required to pay&#13;
          the exercise price;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       -7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               (vi) a reduction  in the amount of any Company  liability  to the&#13;
          Optionee,  including  any  liability  attributable  to the  Optionee's&#13;
          participation in any  Company-sponsored  deferred compensation program&#13;
          or arrangement;&#13;
&#13;
               (vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or&#13;
&#13;
               (viii)  such other  consideration  and method of payment  for the&#13;
          issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.&#13;
&#13;
     9. Exercise of Option.&#13;
&#13;
          (a)  Procedure  for  Exercise;  Rights as a  Stockholder.  Any  Option&#13;
     granted  hereunder  shall be  exercisable  at such  times  and  under  such&#13;
     conditions  as  determined  by  the  Administrator,  including  performance&#13;
     criteria with respect to the Company  and/or the Optionee,  and as shall be&#13;
     permissible under the terms of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
     An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.&#13;
&#13;
     An Option  shall be  deemed to be  exercised  when  written  notice of such&#13;
     exercise has been given to the Company in accordance  with the terms of the&#13;
     Option by the person  entitled to exercise  the Option and full payment for&#13;
     the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised  has been received&#13;
     by the  Company.  Full  payment may, as  authorized  by the  Administrator,&#13;
     consist of any  consideration and method of payment allowable under Section&#13;
     8(b) of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry&#13;
     on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized  transfer agent of the&#13;
     Company) of the stock certificate  evidencing such Shares, no right to vote&#13;
     or receive  dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with&#13;
     respect to the Optioned Stock,  notwithstanding the exercise of the Option.&#13;
     The  Company  shall  issue (or cause to be issued)  such stock  certificate&#13;
     promptly  upon  exercise of the Option.  No  adjustment  will be made for a&#13;
     dividend  or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the&#13;
     stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 12 of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
     Exercise  of an Option in any  manner  shall  result in a  decrease  in the&#13;
     number of Shares which  thereafter  may be available,  both for purposes of&#13;
     the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which&#13;
     the Option is exercised.&#13;
&#13;
          (b)  Termination  of  Employment  or  Consulting  Relationship.   Upon&#13;
     termination  of  an  Optionee's   Continuous   Status  as  an  Employee  or&#13;
     Consultant,  other  than  upon  the  Optionee's  death or  Disability,  the&#13;
     Optionee  may  exercise  his or her Option,  but only within such period of&#13;
     time as is  specified  in the Notice of Grant,  and only to the extent that&#13;
     the Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of termination (but in&#13;
     no event later than the  expiration of the term of such Option as set forth&#13;
     in the Notice of Grant).  In the absence of a specified  time in the Notice&#13;
     of Grant,  the  Option  shall  remain  exercisable  for  three  (3)  months&#13;
     following the  Optionee's  termination.  In the case of an Incentive  Stock&#13;
     Option,  such period of time for exercise shall not exceed three (3) months&#13;
     from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       -8-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     date of termination.  If, on the date of  termination,  the Optionee is not&#13;
     entitled to exercise the Optionee's  entire  Option,  the Shares covered by&#13;
     the unexercisable portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after&#13;
     termination,  the Optionee  does not exercise his or her Option  within the&#13;
     time specified by the  Administrator,  the Option shall terminate,  and the&#13;
     Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
     Notwithstanding  the above, in the event of an Optionee's  change in status&#13;
     from  Consultant  to Employee or Employee  to  Consultant,  the  Optionee's&#13;
     Continuous  Status as an Employee  or  Consultant  shall not  automatically&#13;
     terminate  solely as a result of such  change in status.  However,  in such&#13;
     event,  an Incentive  Stock  Option held by the Optionee  shall cease to be&#13;
     treated as an Incentive  Stock Option and shall be treated for tax purposes&#13;
     as a  Nonstatutory  Stock Option three  months and one day  following  such&#13;
     change of status.&#13;
&#13;
          (c) Disability of Optionee. In the event that an Optionee's Continuous&#13;
     Status  as  an  Employee  or  Consultant  terminates  as a  result  of  the&#13;
     Optionee's  Disability,  the Optionee may exercise his or her Option at any&#13;
     time within twelve (12) months from the date of such termination,  but only&#13;
     to the extent that the  Optionee was entitled to exercise it at the date of&#13;
     such  termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of&#13;
     such  Option  as set  forth in the  Notice  of  Grant).  If, at the date of&#13;
     termination,  the  Optionee is not  entitled to exercise  his or her entire&#13;
     Option, the Shares covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall&#13;
     revert to the Plan. If, after  termination,  the Optionee does not exercise&#13;
     his or her  Option  within the time  specified  herein,  the  Option  shall&#13;
     terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
          (d) Death of Optionee.  In the event of the death of an Optionee,  the&#13;
     Option may be exercised at any time within twelve (12) months following the&#13;
     date of death  (but in no event  later than the  expiration  of the term of&#13;
     such Option as set forth in the Notice of Grant),  by the Optionee's estate&#13;
     or by a person who  acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or&#13;
     inheritance,  but only to the extent  that the  Optionee  was  entitled  to&#13;
     exercise  the  Option at the date of death.  If, at the time of death,  the&#13;
     Optionee was not entitled to exercise his or her entire Option,  the Shares&#13;
     covered by the unexercisable portion of the Option shall immediately revert&#13;
     to the Plan.  If,  after  death,  the  Optionee's  estate  or a person  who&#13;
     acquired  the right to exercise the Option by bequest or  inheritance  does&#13;
     not exercise the Option within the time specified herein,  the Option shall&#13;
     terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
          (e) Buyout Provisions.  The Administrator may at any time offer to buy&#13;
     out for a payment in cash or Shares, an Option previously granted, based on&#13;
     such  terms  and  conditions  as  the  Administrator  shall  establish  and&#13;
     communicate to the Optionee at the time that such offer is made.&#13;
&#13;
          (f) Rule 16b-3.  Options granted to individuals  subject to Section 16&#13;
     of the Exchange Act ("Insiders") must comply with the applicable provisions&#13;
     of Rule 16b-3 and shall contain such additional  conditions or restrictions&#13;
     as may be required  thereunder  to qualify for the maximum  exemption  from&#13;
     Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to Plan transactions.&#13;

     10.  Non-Transferability  of Options.  The Option may not be sold, pledged,&#13;
assigned, hypothecated,  transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by&#13;
will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised,  during the&#13;
lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.&#13;
&#13;
     11. Stock Purchase Rights.&#13;
&#13;
          (a) Rights to Purchase.  Stock  Purchase  Rights may be issued  either&#13;
     alone,  in addition  to, or in tandem with other awards  granted  under the&#13;
     Plan and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan.  After the  Administrator&#13;
     determines  that it will offer Stock  Purchase  Rights  under the Plan,  it&#13;
     shall  advise  the  offeree  in  writing  of  the  terms,   conditions  and&#13;
     restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that such&#13;
     person  shall be  entitled to  purchase,  the price to be paid and the time&#13;
     within  which such person  must accept such offer,  which shall in no event&#13;
     exceed ninety (90) days from the date upon which the Administrator made the&#13;
     determination  to grant  the  Stock  Purchase  Right.  The  offer  shall be&#13;
     accepted  by  execution  of a purchase  agreement  (the  "Restricted  Stock&#13;
     Purchase  Agreement") in the form determined by the  Administrator.  Shares&#13;
     purchased pursuant to the grant of a Stock Purchase Right shall be referred&#13;
     to herein as "Restricted Stock".&#13;
&#13;
          (b) Repurchase Option. Unless the Administrator  determines otherwise,&#13;
     the  Restricted  Stock  Purchase   Agreement  shall  grant  the  Company  a&#13;
     repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination&#13;
     of the purchaser's  employment  with the Company for any reason  (including&#13;
     death or Disability). The purchase price for Shares repurchased pursuant to&#13;
     the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall be the original price paid by&#13;
     the purchaser and may be paid by  cancellation  of any  indebtedness of the&#13;
     purchaser to the Company. The repurchase option shall lapse at such rate as&#13;
     the Administrator may determine.&#13;
&#13;
          (c) Other  Provisions.  The Restricted Stock Purchase  Agreement shall&#13;
     contain such other terms,  provisions and conditions not inconsistent  with&#13;
     the Plan as may be determined by the  Administrator in its sole discretion.&#13;
     In addition,  the provisions of Restricted  Stock purchase  agreements need&#13;
     not be the same with respect to each purchaser.&#13;
&#13;
          (d)  Rights  as a  Stockholder.  Once  the  Stock  Purchase  Right  is&#13;
     exercised,  the  purchaser  shall have the rights  equivalent to those of a&#13;
     stockholder, and shall be a stockholder when his or her purchase is entered&#13;
     upon the records of the duly authorized  transfer agent of the Company.  No&#13;
     adjustment  will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record&#13;
     date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised,  except as&#13;
     provided in Section 12 of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
          (e) Rule 16b-3. Stock Purchase Rights granted to Insiders,  and Shares&#13;
     purchased by Insiders in connection  with Stock Purchase  Rights,  shall be&#13;
     subject to any  restrictions  applicable  thereto in  compliance  with Rule&#13;
     16b-3. An Insider may only purchase Shares pursuant to the grant of a Stock&#13;
     Purchase Right, and may only sell Shares purchased pursuant to the grant of&#13;
     a Stock Purchase Right,  during such time or times as are permitted by Rule&#13;
     16b-3.&#13;
&#13;
     12. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution or Merger.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          (a) Changes in  Capitalization.  Subject to any required action by the&#13;
     stockholders  of the Company,  the number of shares of Common Stock covered&#13;
     by each  outstanding  Option or Stock  Purchase  Right,  and the  number of&#13;
     shares of Common Stock which have been  authorized  for issuance  under the&#13;
     Plan but as to which no  Options  or Stock  Purchase  Rights  have yet been&#13;
     granted  or which  have  been  returned  to the Plan upon  cancellation  or&#13;
     expiration of an Option or Stock Purchase  Right,  as well as the price per&#13;
     share of Common  Stock  covered  by each such  outstanding  Option or Stock&#13;
     Purchase  Right,  shall be  proportionately  adjusted  for any  increase or&#13;
     decrease in the number of issued  shares of Common Stock  resulting  from a&#13;
     stock  split,   reverse  stock  split,   stock  dividend,   combination  or&#13;
     reclassification  of the Common Stock, or any other increase or decrease in&#13;
     the number of issued  shares of Common Stock  effected  without  receipt of&#13;
     consideration  by the Company;  provided,  however,  that conversion of any&#13;
     convertible  securities  of the  Company  shall  not be deemed to have been&#13;
     "effected without receipt of consideration".  Such adjustment shall be made&#13;
     by the Administrator,  whose  determination in that respect shall be final,&#13;
     binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by&#13;
     the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into&#13;
     shares of stock of any class,  shall  affect,  and no  adjustment by reason&#13;
     thereof  shall be made with  respect  to,  the number or price of shares of&#13;
     Common Stock subject to an Option or Stock Purchase Right.&#13;
&#13;
          (b)  Dissolution  or  Liquidation.   In  the  event  of  the  proposed&#13;
     dissolution or liquidation of the Company,  to the extent that an Option or&#13;
     Stock Purchase Right has not been previously  exercised,  it will terminate&#13;
     immediately  prior to the consummation of such proposed  action.  The Board&#13;
     may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that&#13;
     any Option or Stock  Purchase  Right shall  terminate as of a date fixed by&#13;
     the Board and give each Optionee the right to exercise his or her Option or&#13;
     Stock Purchase Right as to all or any part of the Optioned Stock, including&#13;
     Shares as to which the Option or Stock  Purchase  Right would not otherwise&#13;
     be exercisable.&#13;
&#13;
          (c) Merger or Asset Sale. In the event of a merger of the Company with&#13;
     or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets&#13;
     of the Company,  each outstanding  Option and Stock Purchase Right shall be&#13;
     assumed  or an  equivalent  option or right  substituted  by the  successor&#13;
     corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation.  In the&#13;
     event that the successor  corporation  refuses to assume or substitute  for&#13;
     the Option or Stock Purchase Right, Administrator shall have the discretion&#13;
     to allow the Optionee to exercise the Option or Stock  Purchase Right as to&#13;
     all of the  Optioned  Stock,  including  Shares  as to which  it would  not&#13;
     otherwise  be  exercisable.  If  an  Option  or  Stock  Purchase  Right  is&#13;
     exercisable in lieu of assumption or  substitution in the event of a merger&#13;
     or sale of assets,  the  Administrator  shall notify the Optionee  that the&#13;
     Option or Stock Purchase Right shall be fully  exercisable  for a period of&#13;
     fifteen  (15) days from the date of such  notice,  and the  Option or Stock&#13;
     Purchase Right shall terminate upon the expiration of such period.  For the&#13;
     purposes of this  paragraph,  the Option or Stock  Purchase  Right shall be&#13;
     considered  assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets,  the option&#13;
     or right  confers  the right to  purchase  or  receive,  for each  Share of&#13;
     Optioned Stock subject to the Option or Stock  Purchase  Right  immediately&#13;
     prior to the merger or sale of assets,  the  consideration  (whether stock,&#13;
     cash, or other  securities  or property)  received in the merger or sale of&#13;
     assets by holders of Common Stock for each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -11-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Share held on the effective  date of the  transaction  (and if holders were&#13;
     offered a choice of consideration,  the type of consideration chosen by the&#13;
     holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares);  provided,  however, that&#13;
     if such  consideration  received  in the  merger or sale of assets  was not&#13;
     solely  common  stock  of the  successor  corporation  or its  Parent,  the&#13;
     Administrator may, with the consent of the successor  corporation,  provide&#13;
     for the  consideration  to be received  upon the  exercise of the Option or&#13;
     Stock  Purchase  Right,  for each Share of  Optioned  Stock  subject to the&#13;
     Option or Stock Purchase  Right, to be solely common stock of the successor&#13;
     corporation  or its  Parent  equal in fair  market  value to the per  share&#13;
     consideration  received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of&#13;
     assets.&#13;
&#13;
     13. Date of Grant.  The date of grant of an Option or Stock  Purchase Right&#13;
shall,  for all  purposes,  be the date on which  the  Administrator  makes  the&#13;
determination  granting such Option or Stock Purchase  Right, or such other date&#13;
as is determined by the  Administrator.  Notice of the determination  shall be&#13;
given to each Employee or Consultant to whom an Option or Stock  Purchase  Right&#13;
is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.&#13;
&#13;
     14. Amendment and Termination of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
          (a) Amendment and Termination. The Board may at any time amend, alter,&#13;
     suspend or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment,  alteration,  suspension&#13;
     or  discontinuation  shall be made  which  would  impair  the rights of any&#13;
     Optionee under any grant  theretofore  made without his or her consent.  In&#13;
     addition,  to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Section 422&#13;
     of the Code (or any other applicable law or regulation),  the Company shall&#13;
     obtain  stockholder  approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and to&#13;
     such a degree as required.&#13;
&#13;
          (b)  Effect  of  Amendment  or  Termination.  Any  such  amendment  or&#13;
     termination of the Plan shall not affect Options  already  granted and such&#13;
     Options  shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been&#13;
     amended  or  terminated,  unless  mutually  agreed  otherwise  between  the&#13;
     Optionee  and the  Administrator,  which  agreement  must be in writing and&#13;
     signed by the Optionee and properly on behalf of the Company.&#13;
&#13;
     15. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares shall not be issued pursuant&#13;
to the exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance&#13;
and  delivery of such Shares  pursuant  thereto  shall  comply with all relevant&#13;
provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as&#13;
amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and&#13;
the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed,&#13;
and shall be further  subject to the  approval of counsel  for the Company  with&#13;
respect to such compliance.&#13;
&#13;
     As a condition  to the  exercise of an Option,  the Company may require the&#13;
person  exercising  such Option to represent and warrant at the time of any such&#13;
exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any&#13;
present intention to sell or distribute such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      -12-&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company,  such a representation  is&#13;
required by any of the aforementioned relevant provisions of law.&#13;
&#13;
     16. Reservation of Shares. The Company,  during the term of this Plan, will&#13;
at all  times  reserve  and keep  available  such  number  of Shares as shall be&#13;
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
     The inability of the Company to obtain  authority from any regulatory  body&#13;
having  jurisdiction,  which authority is deemed by the Company's  counsel to be&#13;
necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve&#13;
the  Company of any  liability  in respect of the  failure to issue or sell such&#13;
Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.&#13;
&#13;
     17.  Agreements.  Options and Stock  Purchase  Rights shall be evidenced by&#13;
written agreements in such form as the Administrator  shall approve from time to&#13;
time.  Such  agreements may contain such other terms and  conditions,  including&#13;
rights of repurchase and rights of first refusal,  as the  Administrator  may in&#13;
its sole discretion deem appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
     18.  Stockholder  Approval.  Continuance  of the Plan  shall be  subject to&#13;
approval by the  stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months before or&#13;
after the date the Plan is adopted.  Such stockholder approval shall be obtained&#13;
in the degree and manner required under applicable state and federal law.&#13;

&#13;
II.  AGREEMENT&#13;
&#13;
     1. Grant of Option.  The Plan Administrator of the Company hereby grants to&#13;
the Optionee  named in the Notice of Grant  attached as Part I of this Agreement&#13;
(the  "Optionee") an option (the "Option") to purchase the number of Shares,  as&#13;
set forth in the Notice of Grant,  at the exercise  price per share set forth in&#13;
the Notice of Grant (the "Exercise Price"),  subject to the terms and conditions&#13;
of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 14(b)&#13;
of the Plan, in the event of a conflict  between the terms and conditions of the&#13;
Plan and the  terms  and  conditions  of this  Option  Agreement,  the terms and&#13;
conditions of the Plan shall prevail.&#13;
&#13;
     If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive  Stock Option ("ISO"),&#13;
this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive  Stock  Option under  Section&#13;
422 of the Code.  However,  if this Option is intended to be an Incentive  Stock&#13;
Option,  to the extent that it exceeds the $100,000 rule of Code Section  422(d)&#13;
it shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option ("NSO").&#13;
&#13;
     2. Exercise of Option.&#13;
&#13;
          (1) Right to Exercise.  This Option is exercisable  during its term in&#13;
     accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice of Grant and the&#13;
     applicable  provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement.  In the event&#13;
     of  Optionee's  death,   Disability  or  other  termination  of  Optionee's&#13;
     employment or consulting relationship,  the exercisability of the Option is&#13;
     governed  by  the  applicable  provisions  of  the  Plan  and  this  Option&#13;
     Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
          (2) Method of Exercise.  This Option is  exercisable by delivery of an&#13;
     exercise notice, in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "Exercise Notice"),&#13;
     which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares&#13;
     in respect of which the Option is being exercised (the "Exercised Shares"),&#13;
     and such other  representations  and  agreements  as may be required by the&#13;
     Company  pursuant to the provisions of the Plan. The Exercise  Notice shall&#13;
     be signed by the  Optionee and shall be delivered in person or by certified&#13;
     mail  to the  Secretary  of the  Company.  The  Exercise  Notice  shall  be&#13;
     accompanied by payment of the aggregate  Exercise Price as to all Exercised&#13;
     Shares.  This Option  shall be deemed to be  exercised  upon receipt by the&#13;
     Company  of  such  fully  executed  Exercise  Notice  accompanied  by  such&#13;
     aggregate Exercise Price.&#13;
&#13;
     No Shares shall be issued  pursuant to the  exercise of this Option  unless&#13;
     such issuance and exercise complies with all relevant provisions of law and&#13;
     the requirements of any stock exchange&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     or quotation  service upon which the Shares are then listed.  Assuming such&#13;
     compliance,   for  income  tax  purposes  the  Exercised  Shares  shall  be&#13;
     considered  transferred to the Optionee on the date the Option is exercised&#13;
     with respect to such Exercised Shares.&#13;
&#13;
     3. Method of Payment.  Payment of the aggregate  Exercise Price shall be by&#13;
any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Optionee:&#13;
&#13;
          (1) cash;&#13;
&#13;
          (2) check;&#13;
&#13;
          (3) delivery of a properly executed exercise notice together with such&#13;
     other  documentation as the  Administrator  and the broker,  if applicable,&#13;
     shall  require to effect an  exercise  of the Option  and  delivery  to the&#13;
     Company of the sale or loan proceeds required to pay the exercise price; or&#13;
&#13;
          (4) surrender of other Shares which (i) in the case of Shares acquired&#13;
     upon  exercise of an option,  have been owned by the Optionee for more than&#13;
     six (6) months on the date of surrender,  and (ii) have a Fair Market Value&#13;
     on the date of  surrender  equal  to the  aggregate  Exercise  Price of the&#13;
     Exercised Shares.&#13;
&#13;
     4. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any&#13;
manner  otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may&#13;
be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by the Optionee.  The terms of&#13;
the  Plan  and this  Option  Agreement  shall  be  binding  upon the  executors,&#13;
administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee.&#13;
&#13;
     5. Term of Option.  This Option may be  exercised  only within the term set&#13;
out in the  Notice  of  Grant,  and may be  exercised  during  such term only in&#13;
accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Option Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
     6.  Tax  Consequences.  Some of the  federal  and  state  tax  consequences&#13;
relating to this  Option,  as of the date of this  Option,  are set forth below.&#13;
THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY  INCOMPLETE,  AND THE TAX LAWS AND  REGULATIONS  ARE&#13;
SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  THE OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE  EXERCISING&#13;
THIS OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.&#13;
&#13;
          (1) Exercising the Option.&#13;
&#13;
               (1)  Nonstatutory  Stock  Option.  The Optionee may incur regular&#13;
          federal  income tax and state income tax liability  upon exercise of a&#13;
          NSO.  The  Optionee  will be treated as having  received  compensation&#13;
          income (taxable at ordinary income tax rates) equal to the excess,  if&#13;
          any, of the Fair Market Value of the  Exercised  Shares on the date of&#13;
          exercise over their  aggregate  Exercise  Price. If the Optionee is an&#13;
          Employee  or a  former  Employee,  the  Company  will be  required  to&#13;
          withhold from his or her compensation or collect from Optionee and pay&#13;
          to the applicable taxing&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          authorities   an  amount  in  cash  equal  to  a  percentage  of  this&#13;
          compensation  income at the time of exercise,  and may refuse to honor&#13;
          the exercise and refuse to deliver Shares if such withholding  amounts&#13;
          are not delivered at the time of exercise.&#13;
&#13;
               (2) Incentive Stock Option.  If this Option  qualifies as an ISO,&#13;
          the Optionee will have no regular  federal  income tax or state income&#13;
          tax liability upon its exercise,  although the excess,  if any, of the&#13;
          Fair Market Value of the Exercised Shares on the date of exercise over&#13;
          their  aggregate  Exercise  Price will be treated as an  adjustment to&#13;
          alternative  minimum  taxable  income for federal tax purposes and may&#13;
          subject  the  Optionee  to  alternative  minimum  tax in the  year  of&#13;
          exercise.  In the event that the Optionee undergoes a change of status&#13;
          from  Employee  to  Consultant,  any  Incentive  Stock  Option  of the&#13;
          Optionee  that  remains  unexercised  shall  cease  to  qualify  as an&#13;
          Incentive  Stock  Option and will be  treated  for tax  purposes  as a&#13;
          Nonstatutory  Stock Option on the  ninety-first  (91st) day  following&#13;
          such change of status.&#13;
&#13;
          (2) Disposition of Shares.&#13;
&#13;
               (1) NSO. If the Optionee  holds NSO Shares for at least one year,&#13;
          any gain  realized  on  disposition  of the Shares  will be treated as&#13;
          long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes.&#13;
&#13;
               (2) ISO. If the  Optionee  holds ISO Shares for at least one year&#13;
          after  exercise and two years after the grant date,  any gain realized&#13;
          on disposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain&#13;
          for  federal  income tax  purposes.  If the  Optionee  disposes of ISO&#13;
          Shares  within one year after  exercise  or two years  after the grant&#13;
          date,  any  gain  realized  on such  disposition  will be  treated  as&#13;
          compensation  income  (taxable at ordinary income rates) to the extent&#13;
          of the excess, if any, of the lesser of (A) the difference between the&#13;
          Fair Market  Value of the Shares  acquired on the date of exercise and&#13;
          the aggregate  Exercise Price, or (B) the difference  between the sale&#13;
          price of such Shares and the aggregate Exercise Price.&#13;
&#13;
               (3) Notice of  Disqualifying  Disposition  of ISO Shares.  If the&#13;
          Optionee  sells or  otherwise  disposes of any of the Shares  acquired&#13;
          pursuant  to an ISO on or before the later of (i) two years  after the&#13;
          grant date,  or (ii) one year after the  exercise  date,  the Optionee&#13;
          shall  immediately  notify the Company in writing of such disposition.&#13;
          The  Optionee  agrees  that he or she may be  subject  to  income  tax&#13;
          withholding by the Company on the compensation  income recognized from&#13;
          such early  disposition of ISO Shares by payment in cash or out of the&#13;
          current earnings paid to the Optionee.&#13;
&#13;

                        1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The following constitute the provisions of the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase&#13;
Plan of Advent Software, Inc.&#13;
&#13;
     1. Purpose.  The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the Company&#13;
and its Designated  Subsidiaries with an opportunity to purchase Common Stock of&#13;
the Company through accumulated  payroll deductions.  It is the intention of the&#13;
Company to have the Plan  qualify as an  "Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan" under&#13;
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The provisions of&#13;
the  Plan,   accordingly,   shall  be  construed  so  as  to  extend  and  limit&#13;
participation  in a manner  consistent with the  requirements of that section of&#13;
the Code.&#13;
&#13;
     2. Definitions.&#13;

     least  twenty  (20)  hours per week and more  than  five (5)  months in any&#13;
     calendar year. For purposes of the Plan, the employment  relationship shall&#13;
     be treated as  continuing  intact while the  individual is on sick leave or&#13;
     other leave of absence  approved by the Company.  Where the period of leave&#13;
     exceeds  90  days  and  the  individual's  right  to  reemployment  is  not&#13;

         6.       Payroll Deductions.&#13;
&#13;
          (a) At the time a participant files his or her subscription agreement,&#13;
     he or she  shall  elect  to have  payroll  deductions  made on each pay day&#13;
     during the Offering  Period in an amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of&#13;
     the  Compensation  which  he or she  receives  on each pay day  during  the&#13;
     Offering Period,  and the aggregate of such payroll  deductions  during the&#13;
     Offering  Period  shall not exceed ten percent  (10%) of the  participant's&#13;
     Compensation during said Offering Period.&#13;
&#13;
          (b) All payroll deductions made for a participant shall be credited to&#13;
     his or her account under the Plan and will be withheld in whole percentages&#13;
     only. A participant may not make any additional payments into such account.&#13;
&#13;
          (c) A participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan&#13;
     as provided in Section 10 hereof,  or may  increase or decrease the rate of&#13;
     his or her payroll  deductions  during the Offering Period by completing or&#13;
     filing with the Company a new subscription  agreement  authorizing a change&#13;
     in payroll  deduction  rate.  The Board may, in its  discretion,  limit the&#13;
     number of participation rate changes during any Offering Period. The change&#13;
     in rate shall be  effective  with the first full payroll  period  following&#13;
     five (5) business days after the Company's  receipt of the new subscription&#13;
     agreement   unless  the  Company  elects  to  process  a  given  change  in&#13;
     participation  more quickly. A participant's  subscription  agreement shall&#13;
     remain in effect for  successive  Offering  Periods  unless  terminated  as&#13;
     provided in Section 10 hereof.&#13;
&#13;
          (d) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  to the extent necessary to comply&#13;
     with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) hereof, a participant's&#13;
     payroll  deductions may be decreased to 0% at such time during any Purchase&#13;
     Period  which is  scheduled  to end during the current  calendar  year (the&#13;
     "Current  Purchase  Period") that the  aggregate of all payroll  deductions&#13;
     which were  previously  used to  purchase  stock  under the Plan in a prior&#13;
     Purchase  Period  which ended  during that  calendar  year plus all payroll&#13;
     deductions  accumulated  with respect to the Current  Purchase Period equal&#13;
     $21,250.  Payroll  deductions shall recommence at the rate provided in such&#13;
     participant's subscription agreement at the beginning of the first Purchase&#13;
     Period which is scheduled to end in the  following  calendar  year,  unless&#13;
     terminated by the participant as provided in Section 10 hereof.&#13;
&#13;
          (e) At the time the option is  exercised,  in whole or in part,  or at&#13;
     the time some or all of the Company's Common Stock issued under the Plan is&#13;
     disposed of, the participant must make adequate provision for the Company's&#13;
     federal, state, or other tax withholding  obligations,  if any, which arise&#13;
     upon the exercise of the option or the  disposition of the Common Stock. At&#13;
     any time, the Company may, but will not be obligated to,  withhold from the&#13;
     participant's  compensation  the amount  necessary  for the Company to meet&#13;
     applicable withholding  obligations,  including any withholding required to&#13;
     make available to the Company any tax  deductions or benefits  attributable&#13;
     to sale or early disposition of Common Stock by the Employee.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         7. Grant of Option.  On the  Enrollment  Date of each Offering  Period,&#13;
each eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period shall be granted an&#13;
option to purchase on each  Exercise  Date during such  Offering  Period (at the&#13;
applicable  Purchase  Price) up to a number of  shares of the  Company's  Common&#13;
Stock  determined by dividing such  Employee's  payroll  deductions  accumulated&#13;
prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Participant's  account as of the&#13;
Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price;  provided that in no event shall&#13;
an Employee be permitted  to purchase  during each  Purchase  Period more than a&#13;
number of Shares  determined  by dividing  $12,500 by the Fair Market Value of a&#13;
share of the Company's Common Stock on the Enrollment Date, and provided further&#13;
that such purchase  shall be subject to the  limitations  set forth in Sec tions&#13;
3(b) and 12 hereof.  Exercise of the option shall occur as provided in Section 8&#13;
hereof,  unless the participant has withdrawn pursuant to Section 10 hereof. The&#13;
Option shall expire on the last day of the Offering Period.&#13;
&#13;
         8. Exercise of Option.  Unless a participant withdraws from the Plan as&#13;
provided in Section 10 hereof, his or her option for the purchase of shares will&#13;
be exercised  automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full&#13;
shares  subject  to  option  shall  be  purchased  for such  participant  at the&#13;
applicable  Purchase Price with the accumulated payroll deductions in his or her&#13;
account.  No  fractional  shares  will  be  purchased;  any  payroll  deductions&#13;
accumulated  in a  participant's  account which are not sufficient to purchase a&#13;
full share  shall be retained in the  participant's  account for the  subsequent&#13;
Purchase  Period or  Offering  Period,  subject  to earlier  with  drawal by the&#13;
participant  as provided in Section 10 hereof.  Any other  monies left over in a&#13;
participant's  account  after  the  Exercise  Date  shall  be  returned  to  the&#13;
participant. During a participant's lifetime, a participant's option to purchase&#13;
shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her.&#13;
&#13;
         9.  Delivery.  As promptly as  practicable  after each Exercise Date on&#13;
which a purchase of shares  occurs,  the Company  shall  arrange the delivery to&#13;
each  participant,  as  appropriate,  of a certificate  representing  the shares&#13;
purchased upon exercise of his or her option.&#13;
&#13;
         10.      Withdrawal; Termination of Employment.&#13;
&#13;
          (a) A  participant  may withdraw all but not less than all the payroll&#13;
     deductions  credited to his or her account and not yet used to exercise his&#13;
     or her option  under the Plan at any time by giving  written  notice to the&#13;
     Company  in the form of Exhibit B to this  Plan.  All of the  participant's&#13;
     payroll  deductions  credited  to his or her  account  will be paid to such&#13;
     participant  promptly  after  receipt  of  notice  of  withdrawal  and such&#13;
     participant's   option  for  the  Offering  Period  will  be  automatically&#13;
     terminated,  and no further  payroll  deductions for the purchase of shares&#13;
     will be made for such Offering Period.  If a participant  withdraws from an&#13;
     Offering Period, payroll deductions will not resume at the beginning of the&#13;
     succeeding Offering Period unless the participant delivers to the Company a&#13;
     new subscription agreement.&#13;
&#13;

&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          (b) Upon a  participant's  ceasing to be an  Employee  (as  defined in&#13;
     Section  2(g)  hereof),  for any  reason,  he or she will be deemed to have&#13;
     elected to withdraw  from the Plan and the payroll  deductions  credited to&#13;
     such  participant's  account during the Offering Period but not yet used to&#13;
     exercise the option will be returned to such participant or, in the case of&#13;
     his or her death, to the person or persons  entitled  thereto under Section&#13;
     14 hereof, and such participant's option will be automatically  terminated.&#13;
     The preceding sentence notwithstanding,  a participant who receives payment&#13;
     in lieu of  notice  of  termination  of  employment  shall  be  treated  as&#13;
     continuing  to be an Employee  for the  participant's  customary  number of&#13;
     hours per week of employment  during the period in which the participant is&#13;
     subject to such payment in lieu of notice.&#13;
&#13;
         11. Interest.  No interest shall accrue on the payroll  deductions of a&#13;
participant in the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
         12.      Stock.&#13;
&#13;
          (a) The maximum  number of shares of the Company's  Common Stock which&#13;
     shall be made  available  for sale under the Plan shall be 300,000  shares,&#13;
     subject to  adjustment  upon  changes in  capitalization  of the Company as&#13;
     provided in Section 18 hereof.  If, on a given Exercise Date, the number of&#13;
     shares with respect to which options are to be exercised exceeds the number&#13;
     of shares then available  under the Plan, the Company shall make a pro rata&#13;
     allocation of the shares  remaining  available for purchase in as uniform a&#13;
     manner as shall be practicable and as it shall deter mine to be equitable.&#13;
&#13;
          (b) The  participant  will have no interest or voting  right in shares&#13;
     covered by his option until such option has been exercised.&#13;
&#13;
          (c) Shares to be  delivered  to a  participant  under the Plan will be&#13;
     registered in the name of the participant or in the name of the participant&#13;
     and his or her spouse.&#13;
&#13;
         13.      Administration.&#13;
&#13;
          (a)  Administrative  Body. The Plan shall be administered by the Board&#13;
     or a committee of members of the Board appointed by the Board. The Board or&#13;
     its  committee  shall have full and  exclusive  discretionary  authority to&#13;
     construe,  interpret  and  apply  the  terms  of  the  Plan,  to  determine&#13;
     eligibility  and to  adjudicate  all disputed  claims filed under the Plan.&#13;
     Every  finding,  decision  and  determination  made  by  the  Board  or its&#13;
     committee  shall, to the full extent permitted by law, be final and binding&#13;
     upon all parties.&#13;
&#13;
          (b)  Rule  16b-3  Limitations.   Notwithstanding   the  provisions  of&#13;
     Subsection (a) of this Section 13, in the event that Rule 16b-3 promulgated&#13;
     under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"),&#13;
     or any successor  provision ("Rule 16b-3") provides  specific  requirements&#13;
     for the  administrators  of plans  of this  type,  the  Plan  shall be only&#13;
     administered by such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       -6-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     a  body  and  in  such  a  manner  as  shall  comply  with  the  applicable&#13;
     requirements of Rule 16b-3.  Unless  permitted by Rule 16b-3, no discretion&#13;
     concerning  decisions regarding the Plan shall be afforded to any committee&#13;
     or person that is not "disinterested" as that term is used in Rule 16b-3.&#13;
&#13;
         14.      Designation of Beneficiary.&#13;
&#13;
          (a) A participant may file a written  designation of a beneficiary who&#13;
     is to receive any shares and cash, if any, from the  participant's  account&#13;
     under the Plan in the event of such partici  pant's death  subsequent to an&#13;
     Exercise  Date on which the option is  exercised  but prior to  delivery to&#13;
     such  participant of such shares and cash. In addition,  a participant  may&#13;
     file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from&#13;
     the participant's account under the Plan in the event of such participant's&#13;
     death prior to exercise of the option.  If a participant is married and the&#13;
     designated beneficiary is not the spouse, spousal consent shall be required&#13;
     for such designation to be effective.&#13;
&#13;
          (b) Such  designation of beneficiary may be changed by the participant&#13;
     at any time by written  notice.  In the event of the death of a participant&#13;
     and in the absence of a beneficiary  validly  designated under the Plan who&#13;
     is  living  at the time of such  participant's  death,  the  Company  shall&#13;
     deliver  such shares  and/or cash to the executor or  administrator  of the&#13;
     estate of the participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been&#13;
     appointed  (to  the  knowledge  of  the  Company),   the  Company,  in  its&#13;
     discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one&#13;
     or more  dependents  or  relatives  of the  participant,  or if no  spouse,&#13;
     dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as&#13;
     the Company may designate.&#13;
&#13;
         15.   Transferability.   Neither  payroll  deductions   credited  to  a&#13;
participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or&#13;
to  receive  shares  under the Plan may be  assigned,  transferred,  pledged  or&#13;
otherwise  disposed of in any way (other  than by will,  the laws of descent and&#13;
distribution or as provided in Section 14 hereof) by the  participant.  Any such&#13;
attempt at assignment,  transfer,  pledge or other  disposition shall be without&#13;
effect,  except  that the  Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw&#13;
funds from an Offering Period in accordance with Section 10 hereof.&#13;
&#13;
         16.  Use of  Funds.  All  payroll  deductions  received  or held by the&#13;
Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and&#13;
the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions.&#13;
&#13;
         17.   Reports.   Individual   accounts  will  be  maintained  for  each&#13;
participant  in the Plan.  Statements of account will be given to  participating&#13;
Employees  at least  annually,  which  statements  will set forth the amounts of&#13;
payroll  deductions,  the Purchase Price, the number of shares purchased and the&#13;
remaining cash balance, if any.&#13;
&#13;
     18. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization,  Dissolution,  Liquidation,&#13;
Merger or Asset Sale.&#13;

&#13;
&lt;PAGE&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          (a) Changes in  Capitalization.  Subject to any required action by the&#13;
     shareholders of the Company, the Reserves as well as the price per share of&#13;
     Common  Stock  covered by each option under the Plan which has not yet been&#13;
     exercised shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in&#13;
     the number of issued shares of Common Stock  resulting  from a stock split,&#13;
     reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the&#13;
     Common Stock,  or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of&#13;
     Common Stock  effected  without  receipt of  consideration  by the Company;&#13;
     provided,  however,  that conversion of any  convertible  securities of the&#13;
     Company  shall  not be deemed to have been  "effected  without  receipt  of&#13;
     consideration".   Such  adjustment  shall  be  made  by  the  Board,  whose&#13;
     determination  in that  respect  shall be final,  binding  and  conclusive.&#13;
     Except as expressly  provided herein,  no issuance by the Company of shares&#13;
     of stock of any class,  or securities  convertible  into shares of stock of&#13;
     any class,  shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made&#13;
     with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common  Stock  subject to&#13;
     an option.&#13;
&#13;
          (b)  Dissolution  or  Liquidation.   In  the  event  of  the  proposed&#13;
     dissolution  or  liquidation  of the  Company,  the  Offering  Periods will&#13;
     terminate  immediately  prior to the  consummation of such proposed action,&#13;
     unless otherwise provided by the Board.&#13;
&#13;
          (c) Merger or Asset  Sale.  In the event of a proposed  sale of all or&#13;
     substantially  all of the  assets  of the  Company,  or the  merger  of the&#13;
     Company with or into another corporation,  each option under the Plan shall&#13;
     be assumed or an equivalent  option shall be  substituted by such successor&#13;
     corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless&#13;
     the Board determines, in the exercise of its sole discretion and in lieu of&#13;
     such assumption or  substitution,  to shorten the Offering  Periods then in&#13;
     progress by setting a new Exercise Date (the "New Exercise  Date").  If the&#13;
     Board shortens the Offering  Periods then in progress in lieu of assumption&#13;
     or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall&#13;
     notify each  participant in writing,  at least ten (10) business days prior&#13;
     to the New Exercise  Date,  that the Exercise  Date for his option has been&#13;
     changed  to the New  Exercise  Date and that his option  will be  exercised&#13;
     automatically  on the New Exercise  Date,  unless prior to such date he has&#13;
     withdrawn  from the Offering  Period as provided in Section 10 hereof.  For&#13;
     purposes  of this  paragraph,  an option  granted  under the Plan  shall be&#13;
     deemed to be assumed if, following the sale of assets or merger, the option&#13;
     confers the right to purchase,  for each share of option  stock  subject to&#13;
     the  option  immediately  prior  to the  sale  of  assets  or  merger,  the&#13;
     consideration  (whether  stock,  cash  or  other  securities  or  property)&#13;
     received  in the sale of assets or merger by  holders  of Common  Stock for&#13;
     each share of Common Stock held on the  effective  date of the  transaction&#13;
     (and if such holders were  offered a choice of  consideration,  the type of&#13;
     consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares&#13;
     of Common Stock); provided, however, that if such consideration received in&#13;
     the sale of assets or merger was not solely  common stock of the  successor&#13;
     corporation or its parent (as defined in Section  424(e) of the Code),  the&#13;
     Board may, with the consent of the successor  corporation,  provide for the&#13;
     consideration  to be  received  upon  exercise  of the  option to be solely&#13;
     common  stock of the  successor  corporation  or its  parent  equal in fair&#13;
     market value to the per share  consideration  received by holders of Common&#13;
     Stock and the sale of assets or merger.&#13;

         19.      Amendment or Termination.&#13;
&#13;
          (a) The Board of  Directors of the Company may at any time and for any&#13;
     reason  terminate  or amend the Plan.  Except as  provided  in  Section  18&#13;
     hereof, no such termination can affect options previously granted, provided&#13;
     that an Offering  Period may be terminated by the Board of Directors on any&#13;
     Exercise Date if the Board  determines  that the termination of the Plan is&#13;
     in the best  interests  of the  Company  and its  shareholders.  Except  as&#13;
     provided  in  Section 18 hereof,  no  amendment  may make any change in any&#13;
     option  theretofore  granted  which  adversely  affects  the  rights of any&#13;
     participant.  To the extent  necessary  to comply  with Rule 16b-3 or under&#13;
     Section 423 of the Code (or any  successor  rule or  provision or any other&#13;
     applicable  law  or  regulation),  the  Company  shall  obtain  shareholder&#13;
     approval in such a manner and to such a degree as required.&#13;
&#13;
          (b) Without  shareholder  consent  and  without  regard to whether any&#13;
     participant rights may be considered to have been "adversely affected," the&#13;
     Board (or its committee) shall be entitled to change the Offering  Periods,&#13;
     limit the frequency  and/or number of changes in the amount withheld during&#13;
     an Offering  Period,  establish  the exchange  ratio  applicable to amounts&#13;
     withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars,  permit payroll withholding&#13;
     in excess of the amount  designated by a participant in order to adjust for&#13;
     delays or  mistakes  in the  Company's  processing  of  properly  completed&#13;
     withholding elections,  establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods&#13;
     and/or  accounting and crediting  procedures to ensure that amounts applied&#13;
     toward  the  purchase  of  Common  Stock  for  each  participant   properly&#13;
     correspond with amounts withheld from the participant's  Compensation,  and&#13;
     establish  such  other  limitations  or  procedures  as the  Board  (or its&#13;
     committee) determines in its sole discretion advisable which are consistent&#13;
     with the Plan.&#13;
&#13;
         20. Notices.  All notices or other  communications  by a participant to&#13;
the Company  under or in  connection  with the Plan shall be deemed to have been&#13;
duly given when  received in the form  specified by the Company at the location,&#13;
or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.&#13;
&#13;
         21. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares shall not be issued with&#13;
respect to an option  unless the  exercise of such option and the  issuance  and&#13;
delivery of such  shares  pursuant  thereto  shall  comply  with all  applicable&#13;
provisions  of law,  domestic or foreign,  including,  without  limitation,  the&#13;
Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended,  the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as&#13;
amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,  and the requirements&#13;
of any stock  exchange  upon which the  shares may then be listed,  and shall be&#13;
further  subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such&#13;
compliance.&#13;
&#13;
                  As a condition to the  exercise of an option,  the Company may&#13;
require the person  exercising  such option to represent and warrant at the time&#13;
of any such exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and&#13;
without  any  present  intention  to sell or  distribute  such shares if, in the&#13;
opinion of counsel for the Company,  such a representation is required by any of&#13;
the aforementioned applicable provisions of law.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         22. Term of Plan.  The Plan shall become  effective upon the earlier to&#13;
occur  of its  adoption  by the  Board  of  Directors  or  its  approval  by the&#13;
shareholders of the Company.  It shall continue in effect for a term of ten (10)&#13;
years unless sooner terminated under Section 19 hereof.&#13;

         accumulated  payroll deductions will be used to automatically  exercise&#13;
         my option.&#13;
&#13;
4.       I have  received a copy of the complete " Advent  Software,  Inc.  1995&#13;
         Employee Stock Purchase  Plan." I understand that my  participation  in&#13;
         the Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan is in all  respects  subject to the&#13;
         terms of the Plan. I understand  that my ability to exercise the option&#13;

&#13;
6.       I understand that if I dispose of any shares received by me pursuant to&#13;

         having received  ordinary income at the time of such  disposition in an&#13;
         amount  equal to the excess of the fair  market  value of the shares at&#13;

         IN  WRITING  WITHIN  30 DAYS  AFTER THE DATE OF ANY  DISPOSITION  OF MY&#13;
         SHARES AND I WILL MAKE ADEQUATE  PROVISION FOR FEDERAL,  STATE OR OTHER&#13;
         TAX WITHHOLDING  OBLIGATIONS,  IF ANY, WHICH ARISE UPON THE DISPOSITION&#13;

         withhold  from  my  compensation  the  amount  necessary  to  meet  any&#13;
         applicable  withholding  obligation including any withholding necessary&#13;
         to make  available  to the  Company  any  tax  deductions  or  benefits&#13;
         attributable  to sale or early  disposition of Common Stock by me. If I&#13;
         dispose of such shares at any time after the  expiration  of the 2-year&#13;
         and 1- year holding  periods,  I understand  that I will be treated for&#13;
         federal income tax purposes as having  received income only at the time&#13;
         of such  disposition,  and that such  income  will be taxed as ordinary&#13;
         income  only to the extent of an amount  equal to the lesser of (1) the&#13;
         excess  of the  fair  market  value of the  shares  at the time of such&#13;
         disposition over the purchase price which I paid for the shares, or (2)&#13;
         15% of the fair  market  value of the  shares  on the  first day of the&#13;
         Offering Period. The remainder of the gain, if any,  recognized on such&#13;
         disposition will be taxed as capital gain.&#13;

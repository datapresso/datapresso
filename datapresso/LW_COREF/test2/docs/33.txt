San Luis, Arizona - U.S. Customs and Border Protection announces the installation of a pilot radio broadcast system for the Port of San Luis aimed to better inform the traveling public with important border-crossing information.

The local 530 AM broadcast station will include reminders of document requirements and how to use high-tech travel cards; information about CBP’s Trusted Traveler Programs; basic border crossing rules and regulations; and will allow port officials to transmit emergency travel information or updates to the local community within a one- to two-mile radius.

CBP has transformed the way it does business at land ports during the last few years, and one of the key elements is active lane management. This concept allows infrastructure enhancements, such as improved license plate readers, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology coupled with light emitting diode (LED) signage, and Trusted Traveler lanes (SENTRI and FAST), to facilitate the entry process for travelers and trade.

Furthering this concept, CBP believes an informed and educated traveler allows officers to process them more efficiently. CBP continues to look for new and effective ways to communicate with the traveling public. Employing an AM transmitter, already in use by many highway and traffic authorities, is expected to prove itself as an effective tool.

While in a pilot phase, CBP will monitor the effectiveness of this new tool. The follow-on analysis will help determine further system installations and messaging.

CBP is the primary organization within Homeland Security tasked with an anti-terrorism mission at our nation’s ports. CBP officers screen all people, vehicles and goods entering the United States while facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel. Their mission also includes carrying out border-related duties, including narcotics interdiction, enforcing immigration and trade laws, and protecting the nation's food supply and agriculture industry from pests and diseases.

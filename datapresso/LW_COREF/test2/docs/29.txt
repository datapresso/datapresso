Lukeville, Arizona - A Scottsdale, Arizona man and woman were arrested Wednesday for allegedly attempting to smuggle nearly 47 pounds of marijuana into the U.S. through the Lukeville, Arizona Port.

Customs and Border Protection officers arrested Kent Edward Raley, 60, and his passenger, Robyn Michelle Mayhan, 45. When they searched Mayhan’s Ford SUV, officers found 25 packages of marijuana, worth an estimated $23,000, inside ice chests containing various types of seafood.

The vehicle and drugs were processed for seizure. Raley and Mayhan were turned over to the Pima County Sheriff’s Department for prosecution.

The Office of Field Operations is the primary organization within Customs and Border Protection tasked with an anti-terrorism mission at our nation’s ports.

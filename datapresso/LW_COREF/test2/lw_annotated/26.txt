He will be arraigned at a later date.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think my client, who is a stand-up guy, is frankly very embarrassed,&quot; Brennan told reporters.&#10;&#10;While not charged in plane incident, Shell was arrested when he finally arrived in Dallas on an outstanding warrant of marijuana possession.&#10;&#10;Shell, who now lives in Philadelphia and turned 29 on Thursday, was taken off the plane for questioning, but once cleared was allowed to fly to Dallas on a later plane.

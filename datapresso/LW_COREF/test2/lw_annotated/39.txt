Australian drone operators say they have also had inquiries about using the technology from paparazzi, and in one case an associate of a bikie gang who wanted to use a drone to guard a drugs lab.&#10;&#10;Mr Bendall said CASA had failed to keep up as the technology had developed and spread.&#10;&#10;&quot;They got behind the eight ball very quickly and now they're trying to play catch up, and it's going to be an industry that's very hard to catch up to,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;A CASA spokesman said it was reviewing its drone regulations, but new recommendations were unlikely before 2014.&#10;&#10;Several certified drone operators interviewed by Fairfax Media, the publisher of this report, said CASA staff had told them that it relied on the industry to police itself.&#10;&#10;But a CASA spokesman denied the authority was outsourcing oversight to the industry. He said CASA had issued &quot;a number&quot; of infringement notices for safety breaches.&#10;&#10;He declined to comment on specific safety incidents. &quot;CASA has a robust process to investigate alleged breaches of the aviation regulations or legislation,&quot; the spokesman said.&#10;&#10;Mr Bendall said: &quot;CASA should be doing their job... It's not our job to police it, it's our job to obey the rules.&quot;&#10;&#10;In the 2009 Perth incident, a radio-controlled model plane came within seconds of colliding with a Virgin Blue 737. Video of the flight was posted on YouTube. It is understood no one was charged.&#10;&#10;A web search reveals several uncertified firms and individuals offering to sell drone services, including aerial photography for real estate and mining companies.&#10;&#10;CASA certification is only required for drones used for commercial purposes.&#10;&#10;A Queensland-based CASA-certified drone operator said: â€œThe dangers of companies that donâ€™t have operating certificates going out and causing damage to human or property is pretty high. We strongly believe that unfortunately the future of terrorism is going to be using drones.â€™â€™&#10;&#10;Authorities around the world, including in Australia, are considering measures that would allow drones to fly in commercial airspace.&#10;&#10;Dr Jonathan Roberts, research director at CSIRO's Autonomous Systems Lab, said more work needed to be done on &quot;sense and avoid&quot; systems used to detect other aircraft and automatic emergency landings.&#10;&#10;Beyond the civilian realm, the Australian army and air force have already used unarmed drones for surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance missions.&#10;&#10;The ABC has reported that the defence force is planning to buy seven new spy drones for maritime surveillance and intercepting asylum seeker boats, at a cost of up to $3 billion.&#10;&#10;ABC1's Foreign Correspondent reported that for years the US flew highly classified Global Hawk spy drone missions from the air force base at Edinburgh, in South Australia.&#10;&#10;It also reported that the RAAF was deploying Israeli-owned drones for battlefield surveillance and to target anti-government fighters in Afghanistan.&#10;"/>

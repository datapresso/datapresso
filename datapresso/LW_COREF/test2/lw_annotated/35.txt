On that date in 2006, two Wisconsin students â€œallegedly obsessedâ€� with the Columbine murders were arrested â€œwith an arsenal of weapons in connection with a planned attackâ€� on a Green Bay high school. Humphrey also noted that a Japanese man who killed eight elementary school students (and injured 13 others) was executed on that date in 2004.&#10;&#10;A law enforcement review of the â€œRebdomineâ€� account revealed a variety of other threatening statements, including, â€œIâ€™m going to show the world what a mass murderer really is. 85 people dead. 160 injured. Iâ€™ll get it done!â€� Following the July 20 Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting, â€œRebdomineâ€� criticized the accused shooterâ€™s performance. â€œJames holmes had 6000 rounds of ammo, but only killed 12â€¦I could have done sooo much better.â€�&#10;&#10;As part of its probe of â€œpotential online death threats,â€� FBI agents served Facebook with a search warrant for IP addresses associated with the â€œRebdomineâ€� account. Then, with the assistance of an Internet service provider, investigators tracked log-ins to the account to a Beaufort, South Carolina home. Other log-ins were made from an iPhone that â€œconnected to the Internet from various cell phone towers that were not in Beaufort.â€�&#10;&#10;Agents last Tuesday raided the White Pine Road residence, which is occupied by Mark Jordan, 57, and several relatives. They seized two Acer computers, an iPhone, two rifles, a revolver, and â€œeight books and notebook involving killing.â€�&#10;&#10;In a TSG interview, Jordan said, â€œit was my daughterâ€� when asked who in his household was connected to the â€œRebdomineâ€� account. Jordan said that FBI agents interviewed his daughter, who he described as being in her 30s and â€œinterested in crime in general.â€� He added that he was not familiar with details of the federal probe.&#10;&#10;No arrests have been made in connection with the FBIâ€™s â€œRebdomineâ€� probe, which is centering on alleged threats transmitted in interstate commerce, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison.

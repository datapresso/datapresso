CBP officers initiated an inspection and detected anomalies in the appearance of the trailer. They continued their exam and located narrow bundles of marijuana concealed in the hollow metal framing of the trailer.&#10;CBP officers removed 85 marijuana-filled bundles from the trailer. No arrests were made and the investigation continues.&#10;U.S. Customs and Border Protection officersâ€™ primary mission is anti-terrorism; they screen all people, vehicles, and goods entering the United States, while facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel into and out of the United States.&#10;Their mission also includes carrying out traditional border-related responsibilities, including narcotics interdiction, enforcing immigration law, protecting the nationâ€™s food supply and agriculture industry from pests and diseases, and enforcing trade laws.&#10;"/>

He said the call was placed after hours Thursday by someone claiming to work for a contractor that provides janitorial services to Carmike.&#10;&#10;While Mayton wouldnâ€™t discuss specifics of the call, Columbus police said the person referenced the Sylvester Stallone movie, â€œThe Expendables 2,â€� that opened Friday.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;â€œIt sounded like a disgruntled worker,â€� Columbus police Lt. Bill Rawn told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer . He said the caller said: â€œâ€˜You donâ€™t pay us enough. You cut back our hours. Weâ€™re not expendable. Weâ€™ll show you weâ€™re not expendable.â€�â€™&#10;&#10;Mayton said the caller outlined â€œsome specifics to a bomb threat at certain locations,â€� but that he did not know how many theaters were mentioned or in how many states.&#10;&#10;Carmike owns 233 theaters in 35 states. Media outlets Friday reported police searching theaters in Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky and North Carolina.&#10;&#10;No bombs were found. Most theaters were cleared to open before their first show times Friday, Mayton said.&#10;&#10;A spokesman for the FBI in Atlanta said the agency is investigating.&#10;&#10;Since a July shooting at a movie theater in Colorado killed 12 and injured 58, theaters nationwide have been on alert. Several people since have been arrested for disrupting movies and bringing firearms to theaters.&#10;"/>

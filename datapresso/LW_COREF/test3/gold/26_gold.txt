(Reuters) - A man avenging <PERSON>his</PERSON> girlfriend over a questionable Facebook photograph was charged on Friday with falsely reporting explosives aboard a plane that was ordered to return to Philadelphia Airport, authorities said.

<PERSON>Kenneth Smith Jr.</PERSON>, 26, was charged with using a telephone to convey false information about the woman's former boyfriend, who was a passenger aboard the US Airways (LCC.N) flight from Philadelphia to Dallas on Thursday.

Shortly after the plane had departed, it was ordered back to Philadelphia when police received a call that the former boyfriend, Christopher Shell, 29, was carrying a "liquid explosive" on board.

No dangerous materials were found and the incident was soon deemed to be a hoax, authorities said.

"<PERSON>Smith</PERSON> stated that his motive for doing so was to avenge Person 1's (<PERSON>Shell</PERSON>) ex-girlfriend of whom Person 1 had posted a compromising picture on Facebook," said an FBI affidavit.

"It is the kind of photo that could incense a boyfriend," <PERSON>Smith's</PERSON> lawyer, <PERSON>William Brennan</PERSON>, told reporters after his afternoon appearance in U.S. District Court, declining to further describe the photograph.

Federal Magistrate <PERSON>Henry Perkin</PERSON> ordered <PERSON>Smith</PERSON> released on his own recognizance on the condition that he keep his job as a restaurant cook, not move from his Philadelphia address, or seek a passport, and stay away from <PERSON>Shell</PERSON> and firearms.

<PERSON>Smith</PERSON>, who appeared in court wearing a green prison jumpsuit, <PERSON>his</PERSON> wrists cuffed in front of <PERSON>him</PERSON>, could face a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 and possible restitution, said the <PERSON>Patricia Hartman</PERSON>, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office. <PERSON>He</PERSON> will be arraigned at a later date.

"<PERSON>I</PERSON> think my client, who is a stand-up guy, is frankly very embarrassed," <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> told reporters.

While not charged in plane incident, <PERSON>Shell</PERSON> was arrested when <PERSON>he</PERSON> finally arrived in Dallas on an outstanding warrant of marijuana possession.

<PERSON>Shell</PERSON>, who now lives in Philadelphia and turned 29 on Thursday, was taken off the plane for questioning, but once cleared was allowed to fly to Dallas on a later plane.

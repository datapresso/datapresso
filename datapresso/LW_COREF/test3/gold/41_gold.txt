Puddle of Mudd singer <PERSON><PERSON>Wes Scantlin</PERSON> was arrested Tuesday in an Austin airport for allegedly being drunkenly combative with a flight attendant while in the air, a rep for the Austin Police Department told TMZ.
You might drink too if you were the singer of Puddle of Mudd.
According to police, <PERSON>Scantlin</PERSON> got into an argument with a flight attendant over alcohol. A source with airport security said <PERSON>Scantlin</PERSON> was upset because the flight crew wouldn't sell him booze.
Maybe they'll now change the band's name to the more sensible Puddle of Booze.
<PERSON>Scantlin's</PERSON> flight was originally bound for L.A. but was re-routed to Bergstrom International Airport, where <PERSON>Scantlin</PERSON> was booted from the plane.
Police told TMZ <PERSON>Scantlin</PERSON> was arrested and booked on suspicion of public intoxication, but <PERSON>he</PERSON> could also later face federal charges of interfering with a flight crew. Because it's always a good idea to cause a ruckus on an airplane.
<PERSON>Scantlin</PERSON> pleaded guilty to felony cocaine possession in July, but the judge agreed to clear <PERSON>his</PERSON> record in 18 months so long as <PERSON>Scantlin</PERSON> obeys all laws, a condition <PERSON>Scantlin</PERSON> may just have violated. <PERSON>He</PERSON> could face prison time for the cocaine charge, as well as for public intoxication and interfering with a flight crew.
<PERSON>BILLIE JOE ARMSTRONG</PERSON> OUT OF HOSPITAL: Green Day frontman <PERSON>Billie Joe Armstrong</PERSON> is out of the hospital after canceling a show in Italy on Sunday night due to illness.
According to MSN.com, the East Bay native was admitted to the Hospital Maggiore in Bologna due to a mystery illness, and the band was forced to miss playing the I-Festival in the same city Sunday. No official details about <PERSON>his</PERSON> condition have been released, but local reports suggest <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> was suffering gastric problems and discharged himself from the hospital Monday.
TMZ caught up with <PERSON>Armstrong</PERSON> at the Los Angeles airport Tuesday, where <PERSON>he</PERSON> indicated <PERSON>he</PERSON> had a throat problem.
Italian publication La Voce also reports some fans caused problems at the hospital by attempting to visit Armstrong.
The singer's bandmates, <PERSON>Mike Dirnt</PERSON> and <PERSON>Tre Cool</PERSON>, released a video statement to apologize to fans.
"We apologize profusely," <PERSON>Dirnt</PERSON> said. "<PERSON>Billy</PERSON> got rushed to the hospital last night due to illness. The doctors don't think it's a good idea for him to play today."
"We're beyond devastated," <PERSON>Cool</PERSON> added. "We're as sad as you guys are. <PERSON>Billie's</PERSON> extremely upset about it, and we'll see you soon."
HOLLYWOOD MOURNS <PERSON>MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN</PERSON>: Hollywood is mourning the death of <PERSON>Michael Clarke Duncan</PERSON>, The 54-year-old actor Monday in a Los Angeles hospital, having never fully recovered from a heart attack <PERSON>he</PERSON> suffered in July.
The 6-foot-5-inch, 325-pound actor "suffered a myocardial infarction on July 13 and never fully recovered," <PERSON>his</PERSON> rep confirmed to the New York Daily News.
<PERSON>His</PERSON> fianc√©e, <PERSON>Omarosa Manigault</PERSON>, told Radar Online, "<PERSON>I</PERSON> am devastated."
The reality TV star and Baptist minister had saved <PERSON>Duncan's</PERSON> life by performing CPR when <PERSON>she</PERSON> found <PERSON>him</PERSON> unresponsive the morning he entered the hospital seven weeks ago, a source told The News.
"<PERSON>He</PERSON> was the love of my life," <PERSON>Manigault</PERSON> told the gossip site.
"<PERSON>I</PERSON> am terribly saddened at the loss of Big <PERSON>Mike</PERSON>," <PERSON>Tom Hanks</PERSON>, who co-starred with <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> in 1999's "The Green Mile," said in a statement. "<PERSON>He</PERSON> was the treasure we all discovered on the set of The Green Mile. <PERSON>He</PERSON> was magic. <PERSON>He</PERSON> was a big love of man and <PERSON>his</PERSON> passing leaves us stunned."
Those who knew <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> said <PERSON>he</PERSON> was a lot like the gentle giant <PERSON>he</PERSON> sometimes played on the big screen.
<PERSON>Frank Darabont</PERSON>, who directed <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> in <PERSON>his</PERSON> breakout Oscar-nominated role in "The Green Mile," called <PERSON>him</PERSON> "one of the finest people <PERSON>I've</PERSON> ever had the privilege to work with or know.
"<PERSON>Michael</PERSON> was the gentlest of souls -- an exemplar of decency, integrity and kindness," <PERSON>Darabont</PERSON> said in a statement. "The sadness <PERSON>I</PERSON> feel is inexpressible."
"<PERSON>I'll</PERSON> miss you, my brother," actor <PERSON>Dwayne</PERSON> (The Rock) <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Duncan's</PERSON> co-star in 2002 flick "The Scorpion King," wrote on Twitter.
"The MOST gentle of Giants. RIP, my friend <PERSON>Michael</PERSON>," actor <PERSON>Tommy Davidson</PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON>Duncan</PERSON> on TV's "Proud Family."
<PERSON>Duncan</PERSON>, a former bodyguard for <PERSON>Will Smith</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jamie Foxx</PERSON>, also starred in "Sin City," "Daredevil" and "The Whole Nine Yards."
"Rest in Peace to my brother who paved the way for me and many Black actors, <PERSON>Michael Clarke Duncan</PERSON>," said "The Expendables 2" actor <PERSON>Terry Crews</PERSON>. "Honored to have known <PERSON>him</PERSON> and called <PERSON>him</PERSON> a friend to <PERSON>me</PERSON> and <PERSON>my</PERSON> family."
<PERSON>TOM CRUISE</PERSON> ALLEGEDLY AUDITIONED A POTENTIAL WIFE: <PERSON>Tom Cruise</PERSON> and the Church of Scientology auditioned actress <PERSON>Nazanin Boniadi</PERSON> to be <PERSON>his</PERSON> wife before <PERSON>he</PERSON> married <PERSON>Katie Holmes</PERSON>, according to a story in the October issue of Vanity Fair.
Apparently <PERSON>she</PERSON> won by not winning.
The story, written by <PERSON>Maureen Orth</PERSON>, says a secret wife-auditioning process began in 2004, headed by <PERSON>Shelly Miscavige</PERSON>, wife of Scientology chief <PERSON>David Miscavige</PERSON>, with the purpose of finding a girlfriend for <PERSON>Cruise</PERSON>. Sources told <PERSON>Orth</PERSON> about the elaborate wife-auditioning process, in which actresses who were Scientologists were chosen and questioned.
A spokesman for <PERSON>Cruise</PERSON> denied the actor <PERSON>Boniadi</PERSON> to be <PERSON>his</PERSON> wife. In a statement to ABC News, the rep said: "Lies in a different font are still lies -- designed to sell magazines." The Church of Scientology told Vanity Fair that no such recruiting project occurred.
Oscar-winning director and former Scientologist <PERSON>Paul Haggis</PERSON> is backing the story. In an email to Showbiz411.com, <PERSON>Haggis</PERSON> said <PERSON>he</PERSON> has known <PERSON>Boniadi</PERSON> for three years.
"<PERSON>I</PERSON> met her through a mutual friend when I was doing my own personal research into the allegations against Scientology, before <PERSON>I</PERSON> wrote my letter of resignation," <PERSON>Haggis</PERSON> wrote. "<PERSON>Naz</PERSON> was embarrassed by <PERSON>her</PERSON> unwitting involvement in this incident and never wanted it to come out, so <PERSON>I</PERSON> kept silent. However <PERSON>I</PERSON> was deeply disturbed by how the highest ranking members of a church could so easily justify using one of their members; how they so callously punished <PERSON>her</PERSON> and then so effectively silenced <PERSON>her</PERSON> when it was done. It wasn't just the threats; they actually made <PERSON>her</PERSON> feel ashamed, when all <PERSON>she</PERSON> had been was human and trusting."
Sounds like a reality show.
<PERSON>Boniadi</PERSON>, an Iranian-born, London-raised actress, was eventually selected as the Chosen One. In a month-long preparation in October 2004, <PERSON>she</PERSON> was audited every day, a process in which <PERSON>she</PERSON> told a high-ranking Scientology official <PERSON>her</PERSON> innermost secrets and every detail of <PERSON>her</PERSON> sex life. <PERSON>Boniadi</PERSON> was told to lose <PERSON>her</PERSON> braces, <PERSON>her</PERSON> red highlights, and <PERSON>her</PERSON> boyfriend, according to the story.
They also made <PERSON>her</PERSON> watch the volleyball scene in "Top Gun" ten straight times.
<PERSON>She</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cruise</PERSON> dated from November 2004 to January 2005. Although <PERSON>she</PERSON> was allegedly in love with <PERSON>him</PERSON>, <PERSON>his</PERSON> intense affection and public displays of that affection were too much for <PERSON>her</PERSON>.
<PERSON>He</PERSON> also jumped on <PERSON>her</PERSON> couch. Twice.
After <PERSON>she</PERSON> reportedly disrespected a Scientology chief, <PERSON>she</PERSON> was asked to move out of <PERSON>Cruise's</PERSON> home and into Scientology's Celebrity Centre where <PERSON>she</PERSON> was later told <PERSON>she</PERSON> had been dumped.
<PERSON>Cruise</PERSON> began dating <PERSON>Katie Holmes</PERSON> in 2005. That same year, <PERSON>Holmes</PERSON> began studying Scientology. "<PERSON>I'm</PERSON> really excited about it," <PERSON>she</PERSON> told The Associated Press at the time. The two divorced in late-June.
The October issue of Vanity Fair hits newsstands September 6.
<PERSON>CHUCK NORRIS</PERSON> SAYS <PERSON>OBAMA</PERSON> RE-ELECTION DOOMS US ALL: <PERSON>Chuck Norris</PERSON> and his wife say in a new video that America is pretty much doomed to face the apocalypse if President <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> wins re-election in November.
Holding hands with wife <PERSON>Gena</PERSON>, <PERSON>Norris</PERSON> looks fairly depressed in <PERSON>his</PERSON> "dire warning to America." <PERSON>He</PERSON> says that our "country as we know it could be lost forever" if <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> is re-elected and that <PERSON>he</PERSON> can't "stand on the sidelines ... (as we) go the way of socialism or something much worse."
It's becoming clear that someone wasn't aware <PERSON>he</PERSON> was play acting in all those bad action movies.
<PERSON>Gena</PERSON> was even more severe, predicting "1,000 years of darkness" if <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> is re-elected.
Last time <PERSON>I</PERSON> checked, presidents only served four-year terms.

A Ryanair Boeing 737-800, registration EI-EBL performing flight FR-9634 from Billund (Denmark) to Rome Ciampino (Italy), had safely landed without apparent problems.

A number of passengers however went to see medical service at Ciampino Airport reporting their legs became itchy during the flight. Medical services found tick bites as cause. The airport stated, it was unclear whether the ticks were present on the aircraft prior to boarding or whether the ticks were brought on board by some other passenger.

The airline stated they "removed an aircraft from service at the request of Italian Health Authorities (USMA) after two passengers who had travelled from Billund to Rome Ciampino complained of insect bites while waiting in the terminal in Ciampino to collect their baggage. As the source of these alleged insect bites was unknown Ryanair was happy to disinfect the aircraft overnight before returning it to service Fri 7 Sept. No other passengers on this flight reported any alleged insect bites."

EI-EBL resumed service the following morning after about 15.5 hours on the ground.

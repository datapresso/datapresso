According to newly released documents, the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the late <PERSON>Robin Gibb</PERSON> after an alleged death threat was made against the law firm representing <PERSON>Molly Hullis</PERSON>, <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON>'s wife for 12 years before they separated in 1980.

The Telegraph reports the law firm of <PERSON>Haymon</PERSON> & <PERSON>Walters</PERSON> flagged the singer to the FBI after receiving "numerous threatening telegrams" from <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> which "threatened their lives." It's unclear when exactly the telegrams were sent but their tone was quite clear as <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> told the firm he hired a hitman to kill them.

"What you have done is just about the limit," <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> told the law firm in one of the Western Union telegrams passed onto the FBI. "<PERSON>I</PERSON> warned and warned you. The situation is now very serious. Know (sic) one walks over me... <PERSON>I</PERSON> have had enough. <PERSON>I</PERSON> have taken out a contract on (name deleted by the FBI). It is now a question of time."

The musician sent the messages from Miami and they were kept hidden in files in both New York and Miami. The files were released through a Freedom of Information act request by the New York Post after <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON>'s death earlier this year.

According to the New York Post, the FBI discussed the best route to take in the investigation without letting <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> know. In December, 1980 the FBI approached <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> before a New York concert where he referred them to <PERSON>his</PERSON> lawyers.

The singer's lawyers said <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> "would not be foolish enough to carry out any threat, especially in view of <PERSON>his</PERSON> singing career" and added Hullis used the FBI to "embarrass <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON>" as a negotiation tactic during their divorce proceedings. The file was closed in March 1981 after <PERSON>Hullis</PERSON> declined to press charges.

<PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> married <PERSON>Hullis</PERSON> in 1968 and had two children together. The couple lived separately for years prior to the divorce with <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> in the U.S. and <PERSON>Hullis</PERSON> in Britain. In 1985 <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> remarried, this time to <PERSON>Dwina Murphy</PERSON>. The marriage lasted until <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON>'s death.

In 2008, <PERSON>Gibb</PERSON> told the Daily Mail that being separated from <PERSON>his</PERSON> children with <PERSON>Hullis</PERSON> after an enforced estrangement left <PERSON>him</PERSON> feeling "as if <PERSON>I</PERSON> was on the verge of madness."

"There were black moments of pure misery when <PERSON>I</PERSON> felt <PERSON>I'd<PERSON> go mad, but <PERSON>I</PERSON> never gave up," <PERSON>he</PERSON> told the publication at the time. "<PERSON>I</PERSON> marked every Christmas. <PERSON>I</PERSON> sent bikes for their birthdays; letters and cards, but there was never a response. It was very distressing."

Neither <PERSON>Gibb's</PERSON> family nor <PERSON>Gibb's</PERSON> surviving brother <PERSON>Barry Gibb</PERSON> had any comment on news regarding the FBI investigation.

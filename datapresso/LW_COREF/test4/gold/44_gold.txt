TSA Disagrees With Call To Centralize, Redistribute VIPR Teams

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has been receiving more money for its collaborative program to put law enforcement and screening officers on surface transportation systems. 

But TSA could operate these Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR) teams more efficiently and effectively, said the inspector general (IG) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently.

The VIPR teams generally support federal, state and local efforts to bolster security for key transportation systems. The teams, stood up permanently in fiscal year 2008, are made up of combinations of Federal Air Marshals, transportation security officers, surface transportation security inspectors, canine detection teams, explosives detection specialists, behavior detection officers and police officers from federal, state and local agencies. They screen rail and bus passengers, search for suspicious behavior or items and generally investigate crimes or acts of terror on transportation systems. 

In a report, Efficiency and Effectiveness of TSA's Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response Program Within Rail and Mass Transit Systems, the DHS IG office made 16 individual recommendations on improving the VIPR teams -- from clarifying legal authorities for officers to ensuring enough canine support to teams to improving training for them.

"Specifically, we reviewed whether TSA has a methodology to select VIPR deployments; whether geographic location and critical infrastructure affect the conduct of VIPR team operations; and whether VIPR teams are efficient and effective in augmenting local, state and Federal efforts to enhance security on rail and mass transit systems," the IG report stated. "TSA has improved the VIPR program since its inception; however, organizational, programmatic and operational challenges remain."

While TSA agreed with many of the IG recommendations, it did not agree with several key ones with regard to strengthening centralized management over VIPR teams and augmenting VIPR teams more according to risk-based assessments. 

The IG office generally found TSA was responsive to its recommendations that the agency do so, but still the disagreement on the recommendations revealed a difference in philosophy between TSA and the IG office on the operation of the teams.

One specific recommendation with which TSA disagreed was a call to provide decision-making authority for VIPR teams to one TSA office to effectively coordinate management and operations of the program.

TSA Administrator <PERSON>John Pistole</PERSON> disagreed in a written response to the report, saying that the Office of Field Operations in the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) provides management responsibility for the VIPR program. FAMS then works collaboratively with other organizations to make decisions on VIPR operations.

"Recognizing the challenges of a multi-functional program, the VIPR organization structure includes section chiefs from OSO [Office of Security Operations] and OSPIE [Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement] who have responsibilities for communicating with their organization leadership and engaging them in policy development analysis," <PERSON>Pistole</PERSON> wrote.

"Given the designation of management responsibility and the collaborative management structure of the program organization, TSA believes its organization structure best serves the interests of internal and external stakeholders and does not intend to make additional organizational changes," <PERSON>he</PERSON> added.

While the IG office largely accepted that answer, it still objected that the organizational structure of the VIPR program "has not been effective, and operational control of field personnel and assets responsible for implementation remains bifurcated."

The report continued, "As a result, without additional modification, the VIPR program will continue to operate inefficiently.  Assigning decision-making authority to one TSA headquarters office to ensure that overall field operations, program activity and engagement, and oversight are coordinated effectively is prudent."

TSA also did not agree with an explicit recommendation to redistribute VIPR FAM positions among field offices specifically in high-threat urban areas, critical infrastructure and mass transit systems based on risk assessments.

In response, <PERSON>Pistole</PERSON> said TSA kind of took a risk-based approach with the initial distribution of VIPR FAM officers and it could surge them into other areas based on any threat information.

In 2010, TSA received funding for extra VIPR FAM positions and allocated them to areas perceived to require more officers, Pistole said. "Regardless of their area of responsibility, all VIPR FAMs are available to respond if credible intelligence is received regarding threats to a particular geographic area."

TSA is expecting to receive funding for more officers this year, Pistole said. In preparation for that, the VIPR program "developed a process to assess the status of all VIPR assets and to allocate assets with a stronger reliance on risk-based decision making, incorporating consideration of threats, vulnerabilities and consequences."

VIPR managers regularly take a look a the deployment patterns for the teams and compares them to designated high-risk infrastructure in each team's area of responsibility, <PERSON>Pistole</PERSON> elaborated. 

"To date, the analyses have not revealed operational problems that require redistribution of existing allocations, rather than surging assets as necessary," <PERSON>he</PERSON> concluded.

Being part of the Transportation Security Administration hinders the ability of teams created to secure local rail and mass-transit systems to coordinate field activities, according to a report (.pdf) from the Homeland Security Department office of inspector general.

Challenges for TSA's Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response program run the gamut of organizational, programmatic and operational issues, the IG concludes in the report, dated Aug. 15. Clarification is needed on law-enforcement activities, roles and responsibilities of team members, and equipment used during operations, the IG says.

Other problems, according to the IG: The VIPR deployment methodology needs refinement; resources are allocated out of proportion to team workloads; training is not standardized; and the length of assignments to VIPR teams affects readiness.

TSA concurred with 12 of the IG's 16 recommendations, including the need for better public awareness, clarity about VIPR operations and documentation, clear engagement protocols and access to risk-assessment information.

But the agency disagreed in four areas:

Designating decision-making authority to one TSA headquarters office. TSA says its collaborative management structure properly allows for decision-making to cross organizational lines.
Ensuring coordination between local VIPR team leaders and the playbook manager, and integration with airport law enforcement VIPR operations. VIPR operations are already coordinated, TSA says, and the specific wording of the recommendation is difficult to translate into operations.
Redistributing existing resources based on risk. TSA says its analysis shows resources can be surged to other areas when needed, but that permanent redistribution is not necessary.
Extending certain team assignments beyond 1 year. Shorter assignments allow TSA to develop a deeper pool of knowledge, the agency says.
TSA does agree it needs an organizationwide VIPR training program, including rail safety and other ground-based incident training scenarios, as well as joint exercises with local law enforcement and other partners.

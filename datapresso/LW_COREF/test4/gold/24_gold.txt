When <PERSON>Tyrese Little</PERSON>, 35, told inquiring police who approached <PERSON>him</PERSON> Sunday morning that <PERSON>he</PERSON> had "just a little weed," which turned out to be a gross underestimation, police said.

<PERSON>Little</PERSON>, approached at 2:30 a.m. by officers <PERSON>Michael Styles</PERSON> and <PERSON>Carlos Conceicao</PERSON> near the Van Dome Nightclub, aroused suspicion when <PERSON>he</PERSON> closed a car door and looked as if <PERSON>he</PERSON> was tucking something into <PERSON>his</PERSON> pants, police said.

The smell of marijuana emanating from where <PERSON>Little</PERSON> stood didnâ€™t help <PERSON>his</PERSON> case.

<PERSON>He</PERSON> was arrested for possessing over 50 grams of crack cocaine packaged in 14 bags for sale, a sandwich bag of marijuana and a loaded "Raven Arms" MP-25 handgun.

Also confiscated from <PERSON>Little</PERSON> were two cell phones and several bundles of cash totaling $11,767. <PERSON>Little</PERSON> faces two weapons and five drug charges.

San Luis, Arizona - Two Mexican nationals were arrested early Wednesday for attempting to smuggle more than six pounds of methamphetamine, worth close to $99,000, into the U.S. through the San Luis, Arizona land port.

Francisco Javier Ibarra Green, 31, traveling with Carlos Garcia Vasquez, 30, and Vasquez’s wife and minor child, were referred for a secondary inspection of his Ford truck. Customs and Border Protection also searched both men and found each to be carrying more than three pounds of methamphetamine around their midsections.

The drugs and vehicle were processed for seizure. Green and Vasquez were turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations. Vasquez’s wife and child were released.

The U.S. Capitol Police and the FBI are investigating threats against Missouri Republican Rep. Todd Akin, who has been widely condemned for a comment about "legitimate rape," according to news reports.

Citing unnamed officials, St. Louis TV station KMOV says "multiple people have threatened rape and harm against Akin, his staff and family."

An Akin spokesperson would not say whether the congressman is receiving additional security.

"I can verify there have been threats made to congressman Akin's official staff and that includes threats of rape to his staff as well as his family. I cannot comment on security-related matters as advised by Capitol Police," the spokesperson said.

KSDK-TV reports that threats were made by phone and Twitter.

Sources say "Ambassador A," a self-described troll, is under investigation for tweeting "I am going to legitimately rape your wife. ;) don't worry her body will defend her."

He also tweeted, "My good sir. Kill yourself."

"The U.S. Capitol Police are currently working with the FBI on a reported threat against congressman Akin. This is an active, open investigation. We don't discuss the security of members of Congress," Capitol Police Lt. Kim Schneider told KSDK, owned by Gannett, USA TODAY's parent.

Akin is attempting to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.

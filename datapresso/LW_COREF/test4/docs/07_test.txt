According to newly released documents, the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the late Robin Gibb after an alleged death threat was made against the law firm representing Molly Hullis, Gibb's wife for 12 years before they separated in 1980.

The Telegraph reports the law firm of Haymon & Walters flagged the singer to the FBI after receiving "numerous threatening telegrams" from Gibb which "threatened their lives." It's unclear when exactly the telegrams were sent but their tone was quite clear as Gibb told the firm he hired a hitman to kill them.

"What you have done is just about the limit," Gibb told the law firm in one of the Western Union telegrams passed onto the FBI. "I warned and warned you. The situation is now very serious. Know (sic) one walks over me... I have had enough. I have taken out a contract on (name deleted by the FBI). It is now a question of time."

The musician sent the messages from Miami and they were kept hidden in files in both New York and Miami. The files were released through a Freedom of Information act request by the New York Post after Gibb's death earlier this year.

According to the New York Post, the FBI discussed the best route to take in the investigation without letting Gibb know. In December, 1980 the FBI approached Gibb before a New York concert where he referred them to his lawyers.

The singer's lawyers said Gibb "would not be foolish enough to carry out any threat, especially in view of his singing career" and added Hullis used the FBI to "embarrass Gibb" as a negotiation tactic during their divorce proceedings. The file was closed in March 1981 after Hullis declined to press charges.

Gibb married Hullis in 1968 and had two children together. The couple lived separately for years prior to the divorce with Gibb in the U.S. and Hullis in Britain. In 1985 Gibb remarried, this time to Dwina Murphy. The marriage lasted until Gibb's death.

In 2008, Gibb told the Daily Mail that being separated from his children with Hullis after an enforced estrangement left him feeling "as if I was on the verge of madness."

"There were black moments of pure misery when I felt I'd go mad, but I never gave up," he told the publication at the time. "I marked every Christmas. I sent bikes for their birthdays; letters and cards, but there was never a response. It was very distressing."

Neither Gibb's family nor Gibb's surviving brother Barry Gibb had any comment on news regarding the FBI investigation.

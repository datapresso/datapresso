It was a bit of a shock.&quot;&#10;&#10;Another man, who was in bed at the time, described the scene as &quot;like a war movie&quot;.&#10;&#10;He said: &quot;They were screaming 'calm down' and 'put your hands up', then they ran upstairs and dragged this guy and girl out and stood them in the middle of the road.&quot;&#10;&#10;Police arrested three men from Witham, aged 39, 21 and 18, and a woman from the Colchester area, aged 19.&#10;&#10;Fawn Bennett, 21, was staying at her boyfriend's flat when the drama started. She said: &quot;My boyfriend woke me up at about 2am and we looked out the window and saw squad cars everywhere. I just thought 'what the hell is happening?'&#10;&#10;&quot;Then I saw the armed police out the front and the back â€“ they surrounded the place. We didn't know what was going on.&quot;&#10;&#10;All four people were released without charge due to the fact they were on private land, and the weapons were returned to the owner.&#10;"/>

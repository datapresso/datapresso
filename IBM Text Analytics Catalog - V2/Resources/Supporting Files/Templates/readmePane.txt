Title: 		  Custom Enterprise Search Pane
Generated by: Text Analytics Catalog Plugin

The Text Analytics Catalog Plugin has automatically generated this
custom search pane for the Enterprise Search application of ICA.

The purpose of this pane is to allow you to search your analytics 
collection using the fields and facets selected by you during the 
deployment process. This custom pane can also be used to jump start 
the building of your own custom pane by giving you a working example
that can then be modified and further enhanced by you.

Below is a description of the two files contained in this folder.

	SearchPane.html - The HTML template file that provides the overall
					  layout of the custom pane
	SearchPaneJS.txt -	The associated java script file that fills in the 
	 				template with the controls for the fields and facets
	 				you selected and provides the execution logic
	 				to submit searches and display results. IF YOU PLAN
	 				TO USE THIS FILE THEN RENAME IT TO "SearchPane.js". 
	 				THE STUDIO DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE .js FILE EXTENSION!
	 				
These two files will automatically be installed with ICA if you checked
the "Deploy to ICA" checkbox during deployment. You can learn more
about how to deploy a custom pane in the Programmer's Guide of ICA.

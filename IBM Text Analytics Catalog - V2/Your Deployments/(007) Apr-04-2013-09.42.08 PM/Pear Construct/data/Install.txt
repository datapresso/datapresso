Where Annotator
General Installation Instructions for New Projects
--------------------------------------------------
Note: no further installation is required in this project. 
      The examples provided should run as is.
       
       
1. Add a Folder to hold the Where annotator (typically Resources\Custom\Where).
 
2. To this folder add the files Where.jar and WhereAEDescriptor.xml

3. Add a custom stage to your annotation pipeline

   3.1 Configure such that so the Analysis Engine File Path points to the WhereAEDescriptor.xml file
   3.2 configure such that the Class Path includes Where.jar
   3.3 complete the Configuration section
       3.3.1 SectionType is the name of your existing annotation that marks the beginning of sections in the document.  
       For example you might have com.ibm.langware.ChapterTitles.
       3.3.2 TargetType is the name of the existing annotation that you want the Where annotator to update with positional information. 
       For example you might have com.ibm.langware.CharacterRole
       3.3.3 TargetSectionFeature is the name of the feature in the TargetType that will be filled in with the section name by the Where annotator. 
       For example your CharacterRole annotation might include a feature "chapter".

***IMPORTANT***   The TargetSectionFeature must exist in your TargetType annotation. The Where annotator fills this feature with a value, it does not create it. It is sufficient to create a string feature in your rule that creates the TargetType and just set it to some arbitary value. This will get overwritten by the Where annotator.

4. Run the pipeline.

Newly published photographs show the Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, his face bloodied, climbing out of a boat in a suburban backyard as heavily armed police officers wait for him to drop to the ground.

The images were among those a state police officer provided in July to Boston Magazine, which published some at the time and has now released a further series.

Sergeant Sean Murphy took photos the night in April police cornered Tsarnaev in a boat stored in a backyard in Watertown, just outside Boston. Smith was not authorised to release the photos but said he was angry about a Rolling Stone magazine cover he felt glamorised Tsarnaev.

The new photos include more shots of Tsarnaev coming out of the boat, his head bloody and a red laser trained on his head. They also show him dropping to the ground, where officers and medical personnel treated him. Other photos show federal, state and local police officials meeting in a command centre and elite police teams gathering in the streets earlier in the day.

The surgeon who treated Tsarnaev after his capture said he had been shot through the face and had a fractured skull, among other injuries.

Tsarnaev was wounded during a confrontation with police a day after authorities released photos of him and his older brother as suspects in the deadly 15 April marathon bombing.

Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to charges in the bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others.

His older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed following a gun battle with police.

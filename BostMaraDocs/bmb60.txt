NEW YORK — Organizers say no backpacks will be allowed at the New York City-wide bike tour expected to draw 32,000 cyclists this weekend. A large police presence is expected.

Bike New York says on its website that fanny packs and some other small bags will be allowed on the Sunday ride that begins in Manhattan and winds through all five boroughs ending on Staten Island.

Organizers say backpacks will be confiscated.

The rule comes after the Boston Marathon bombing where explosives were concealed in backpacks.

Police say officers on bikes and scooters will ride with the tour. Mobile cameras, radiation detectors and counterterrorism teams will be deployed. Harbor officers will escort ferries going to and from Staten Island.

The TD Five Boro Bike Tour is a 40-mile annual ride.

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The Ethio­pian winner of this year’s Boston Marathon said Sunday that he will donate his first-place medal to the people of Boston, telling visiting Secretary of State John F. Kerry that he wants to honor the dead and wounded from the finish-line bombing.

“Less than two hours after I crossed the finish line as this year’s champion, my joy turned to sorrow,” Lelisa Desisa said. “This day brought pain to many families and sorrow to many homes,” the 23-year-old novice marathoner added as he announced his plan to travel to Boston to return the medal.


“Sport should never be used as a battleground,” Lelisa said through a translator. He said that he and his team will return to Boston to run again next year “to show the world that our commitment to sport, our commitment to our freedom will be stronger than any act of violence.”

Lelisa won the April 15 marathon with a time of 2:10:22. A pair of explosions near the finish line killed three people and injured more than 200 others.

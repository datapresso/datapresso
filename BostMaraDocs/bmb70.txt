Two friends of the suspected Boston Marathon bomber have been indicted on obstruction and conspiracy charges.

Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov are accused of trying to dispose of evidence from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room.

Authorities say they later found some of the items in a New Bedford landfill.

The two 19-year-olds have been detained since they were initially charged in May. If convicted, they face up to 20 years in prison.

An attorney for Tazhayakov says his client did nothing wrong and that he has tried for the last several months to persuade authorities to drop the charges. He says he and his client both agree that authorities are on a "witch hunt".

Kadyrbayev's attorney didn't immediately return a message for comment.

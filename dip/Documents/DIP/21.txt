ARMED police surrounded a quiet courtyard after a man was seen wielding a crossbow.

In the early hours of Monday morning, firearms officers blockaded Newland Street, Witham, while they arrested four people in a flat and seized a crossbow, machete and a sword.

According to police, a member of the public had seen a man with a crossbow in Barnfield Place, just off the main road.

Residents were woken at about 1am by shouts, search lights and dogs barking.

One neighbour, who did not wish to be named, watched the drama unfold from her bedroom window.

"I heard the police dogs going crazy and someone was shouting, 'armed police, get down on the floor or else we will shoot you,'" she said.

It is thought the man with the crossbow was trying to make his way back up to the flat when police arrested him.

But another neighbour, known only as Colin, was greeted by police when he stepped outside.

"I got stopped straight away by a policeman and they stuck handcuffs on me," said Colin.

"But after 20 minutes of answering their questions they eventually let me go. It was a bit of a shock."

Another man, who was in bed at the time, described the scene as "like a war movie".

He said: "They were screaming 'calm down' and 'put your hands up', then they ran upstairs and dragged this guy and girl out and stood them in the middle of the road."

Police arrested three men from Witham, aged 39, 21 and 18, and a woman from the Colchester area, aged 19.

Fawn Bennett, 21, was staying at her boyfriend's flat when the drama started. She said: "My boyfriend woke me up at about 2am and we looked out the window and saw squad cars everywhere. I just thought 'what the hell is happening?'

"Then I saw the armed police out the front and the back – they surrounded the place. We didn't know what was going on."

All four people were released without charge due to the fact they were on private land, and the weapons were returned to the owner.

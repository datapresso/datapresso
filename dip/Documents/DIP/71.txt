Raw sewage spewed on airline baggage

Raw sewage from a broken pipe was spewed on the checked luggage of at least 100 passengers at London Heathrow airport earlier this week, according to a report in the British tabloid, The Sun. The incident occurred in the bowels British Airway’s giant Terminal T5.

Many arriving passengers had to leave the airport without their bags, which BA sent away for cleaning. According to the report, a source said: “The smell was absolutely foul, as was the mood of the passengers who had to leave without their bags.”

British newspaper, The Independent reported,

A spokesman for the airport operator, BAA Heathrow, said: ‘There was a leak from the sewage system in the baggage area of Terminal 5 on Monday which affected around a hundred bags.

‘We appreciate this will be upsetting for passengers. The bags have now been cleaned and are being reunited with their owners.’

British Airways also apologised to its passengers for the incident and any inconvenience caused.

As a travel writer and consultant, I’ve heard  my share of travel horror stories, but this has to rank as one of the worst. Could you imagine arriving in London all set for an important meeting, and then learn that the suit you were going to wear got drenched… in sewage? Ick!

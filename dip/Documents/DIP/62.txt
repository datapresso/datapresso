About 40 passengers standing near the departure gate of Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport at Amausi had a close shave when a huge chunk of the glass wall broke and the pieces fell on them.


Although no one was injured, the incident highlighted the fact that poor construction material was used in building the new airport terminal that was inaugurated just three months ago by the minister of civil aviation Ajit Singh.

Just a fortnight ago Singh had ordered an inquiry by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) into the poor quality of construction work after a preliminary enquiry report by a committee headed by cheif vigilance officer, Pawan Hans Helicopters Limited Samir Sahai, found the quality of work in the new terminal building to be below standard.

RK Singh, one of the passengers present on the spot said, "I ran when I heard screams after the glass wall crashed. The passengers were terrified. When they got back their composure, they protested."

Following the incident there was a heated exchange of words between angry passengers and airport authorities. HT was witness to sweepers sweeping the floor and collecting the glass pieces in a big bucket.

Some glass pieces were big enough to cause serious injuries. Insiders say that the glass used was not of good quality. Airport director Suresh Chand Hota, who was in Delhi, said, "All the glass would be replaced and the whole building would be checked as passengers safety is most important for us." On the quality of the material used, he said a probe was already on.

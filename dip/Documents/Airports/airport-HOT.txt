David Letterman’s jokes aren’t funny to everyone. 

A militant Islamic jihadist, Umar al-Basrawi , is urging his followers on his Al Qaeda-affiliated Web site to cut off the funnyman’s tongue and break his neck, after David made jokes in a monologue about the death of Al Qaeda terrorist Ilyas Kashmiri .

al-Basrawi wrote on his Web site, “I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears, one of the lowlifes of the Jews, and one of their pigs, mocking one of the leaders of the mujahedeen…We pray to Allah to paralyze his tongue, and that the righteous believers will break his neck.” Letterman’s Protestant, not Jewish.

The FBI is investigating the threat but there is no specific threats against him.

Representatives for the show, which is on hiatus, did not comment.

A jihadist has marked David Letterman for death and ordered followers to “cut the tongue of the lowly Jew and shut it forever.”

The demand, part of a rant on the Shumukh al-Islam Web forum, claims the Late Show host – who is Protestant – must be punished for joking about Al Qaeda leader Ilyas Kashmiri, killed during a U.S. strike in Pakistan.

PLAYA DEL REY, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- 
A man was wounded when he was shot in the leg at Dockweiler State Beach near Los Angeles International Airport. 

The incident happened shortly before 9 p.m. Saturday. At first, police thought it was a self-inflicted wound. Investigators later learned the man had been shot by someone in red clothing. 

Police questioned three people in connection with the shooting. All three were wearing red jackets. 

Dockweiler State Beach was on lockdown for nearly four hours during the investigation, but it has since reopened.
